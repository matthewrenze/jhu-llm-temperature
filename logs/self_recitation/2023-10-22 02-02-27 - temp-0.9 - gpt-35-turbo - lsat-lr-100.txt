### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing colas tasted. The study used blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas. The advertisement concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
A: The advertisement addresses that the volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Therefore, each group had equal representation and the possibility of a different result is not a significant criticism.
B: The advertisement does not make any claim about the price of Sparkle Cola or its competitors, so this is not a valid criticism.
C: The advertisement does not claim that Sparkle Cola is the best cola in the world, only that it is better than the competing colas tested. Therefore, this criticism is not relevant.
D: This is a potential criticism of the advertisement. There are other reasons why someone might prefer Sparkle Cola to a competing cola, such as packaging or price, that are not related to taste.
E: This is not a valid criticism of the advertisement. The study was specifically examining people's preferences for different colas, not other types of beverages.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement uses a selectively biased experiment where the five groups tasted different colas, one of which was Sparkle Cola.
  A: The study divided the volunteers into five small groups and each group tasted a different cola. Therefore, this choice is not a criticism of the advertisement's reasoning.
  B: The study did not consider the price of Sparkle Cola or the other colas tested. Therefore, this choice is not a criticism of the advertisement's reasoning.
  C: The study only tested a sample of five colas, including Sparkle Cola, so there may be other brands not tested which may elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. Therefore, this is a possible criticism of the advertisement's reasoning.
  D: The study did not consider other factors that may influence consumer preferences such as packaging or price. Therefore, this choice is not a criticism of the advertisement's reasoning.
  E: The study only tested colas, and did not elicit responses to any other type of beverage. Therefore, this choice is not a criticism of the advertisement's reasoning.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement conducted a study where blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, and most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola.
  A: This option suggests the advertisement should also test each of the five smaller groups separately to confirm the generalization about Sparkle Cola's favorability.
  B: This option discusses a situation where Sparkle Cola is more expensive, which is not mentioned in the advertisement.
  C: This option suggests that there may be a cola not tested that could have had a more favorable response, but the advertisement only measures responses from the tested colas.
  D: This option suggests that the preference towards Sparkle Cola may be due to other reasons, not just taste. However, the advertisement only focuses on the taste preference of the volunteers.
  E: This option discusses a limitation of the study conducted by the advertisement, but it does not criticize the advertisement's reasoning directly. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: This choice discusses the possibility that the generalization may not apply equally to all subgroups, but it does not address the main conclusion of the argument.
  B: This choice discusses the possibility of related factors such as Sparkle Cola's price, which could affect the preference, but this does not undermine the main conclusion.
  C: This choice argues that there may be even better colas than the ones tested, but this does not undermine the main conclusion.
  D: This choice provides an alternative explanation for why people might prefer Sparkle Cola over other colas, which undermines the main claim of the advertisement that Sparkle Cola is preferred because of its taste.
  E: The choice is irrelevant to the argument made in the advertisement.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement presented a study with blindfolded volunteers tasting Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas.
  Most volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  A: This choice criticizes the study design, but it does not invalidate the conclusion of the study.
  B: This choice brings up a different assumption that is not directly related to the study itself.
  C: This choice criticizes the study design, but it does not invalidate the conclusion of the study.
  D: This choice is a plausible criticism and suggests that the study may not have isolated taste as the only variable accounting for the preferences expressed. 
  E: This choice is irrelevant as the study focuses on comparing the taste of different colas.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The advertisement claims that most volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing colas tasted in the study.
A: This answer choice questions whether there is a possibility that the generalization that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola over the competing colas tested, might not be true for each of the five separate groups of volunteers.
B: This answer choice assumes that the study might not be relevant to real-world situations, as it doesn't take into account factors such as price and availability, and whether the volunteers would actually buy the colas they preferred in the study.
C: This answer choice speculates that there might be other colas not tested in the study that would elicit a more favorable response from consumers than Sparkle Cola.
D: This answer choice suggests that the preference of Sparkle Cola over the competing colas might not be based solely on the taste of the cola, but on other factors such as packaging or price.
E: This answer choice is not relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement as it does not address the validity of the study conducted.
 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  A: This choice suggests that the results of the study might not be true of each of the five small groups, but it does not criticize the logical reasoning about the conclusion.
  B: This choice is related to the possibility of buying the product, not the preference for Sparkle Cola. It is irrelevant to the logical reasoning used in the advertisement. 
  C: This choice is related to the possibility of a better product, not the preference for Sparkle Cola. It is irrelevant to the logical reasoning used in the advertisement.
  D: This choice suggests that the preference for Sparkle Cola might be based on reasons other than taste, which is a criticism of the logical reasoning used in the advertisement.
  E: This choice is irrelevant to the logical reasoning used in the advertisement.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The advertisement is claiming that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
A: This choice criticizes the conclusion of the advertisement by pointing out that the study might not have been large enough to generalize about the preferences of all consumers who might buy Sparkle Cola. However, it does not address the fact that the advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola is preferred to all of the five competing colas tested.
B: This choice does not criticize the study's conclusion, but rather talks about the additional condition that might affect the participants' buying behavior.
C: This choice criticizes the study by pointing out that there might be some other cola that participants might prefer more than Sparkle Cola. However, it also does not address the fact that the advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola is preferred to all of the five competing colas tested.
D: This choice criticizes the advertisement and the study by pointing out that people may not prefer Sparkle Cola for its taste alone, whereas the study measures only the taste preference of the participants.
E: This choice is irrelevant to the conclusion that Sparkle Cola elicits more favorable responses than the five tested competing colas.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted, based on a carefully controlled study.
  A: This choice criticizes the generalization made from the five smaller groups and points out that the study may not hold true for each group or individual.
  B: This choice criticizes the assumption that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola over other colas in all situations.
  C: This choice criticizes the possibility that there might be other colas better than Sparkle Cola that were not included in the study.
  D: This choice criticizes the possibility that the preference for Sparkle Cola may not have been solely based on its taste, but other factors like packaging or price.
  E: This choice criticizes the study for only testing colas and not other beverages.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  Volunteers were divided into five groups, with each group tasting a different cola.
  Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.

A: This choice attacks the representativeness of the study, but it does not address the reasoning used in the advertisement.
B: This choice assumes that price is a factor and is outside the scope of the advertisement.
C: This choice attacks the external validity of the study, but it does not address the reasoning used in the advertisement.
D: This choice attacks the internal validity of the study by suggesting that factors other than taste may have influenced the results. This is a valid criticism of the advertisement's reasoning.
E: This choice is outside the scope of the advertisement.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument above uses a flawed pattern of reasoning known as affirming the consequent. It takes the form: if A then B, B, therefore A. This is a fallacy because other factors could cause B. 
  A: This argument is not flawed; it is a valid argument that uses the modus ponens pattern of reasoning, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning.
  B: This argument uses affirming the consequent, similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above. If A then B, B, therefore A.
  C: This argument is not flawed; it is a valid argument that uses a conditional statement and modus tollens pattern of reasoning, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning.
  D: This argument uses affirming the consequent, similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above. If A then B, B, therefore A.
  E: This argument is not flawed, but it is not similar in pattern of reasoning to the flawed argument above. It uses the conjunction fallacy, which is when people assume that specific conditions are more probable than general ones.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument presents a conditional statement in the form "if A, then B" and argues that "if not B, then not A". This is flawed because there could be other reasons why B does not happen. 
A: The argument presents a conditional statement but does not argue for its converse.
B: The argument presents a conditional statement and argues for its converse, which is flawed.
C: The argument does not present a conditional statement, and thus is not similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above.
D: The argument presents a conditional statement and argues for its converse, which is flawed.
E: The argument presents a conditional statement and argues for its converse, which is flawed.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a conditional statement with two premises: (1) if squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds, and (2) squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. It concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover. The argument contains a flawed pattern of reasoning, suggesting that it is invalid or unsound. 
  A: The argument presents a similar conditional statement with two premises: (1) if a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and (2) if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. It concludes that if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely. The argument is valid and not flawed.
  B: The argument presents a similar conditional statement with two premises: (1) if a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and (2) tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. It concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. The argument is not flawed and is valid.
  C: The argument presents a conditional statement with two premises: (1) tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly, and (2) unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. It concludes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure. The argument is not flawed and is valid.
  D: The argument presents a similar conditional statement with two premises: (1) if a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and (2) tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. It concludes that if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely. The argument is not flawed and is valid.
  E: The argument presents a conditional statement with two premises: (1) if a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and (2) it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. It concludes that if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer. The argument is not flawed and is valid.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument above has the pattern of reasoning: 
    If A, then B, but only if C. Therefore, if not C, then not B. 
    This is an instance of denying the consequent, a logical fallacy in which one concludes that if a conditional statement's consequent is false, then its antecedent must also be false.
  A: The argument presents a true conditional statement. Checking the tire pressure regularly is a sufficient condition to prevent tires from wearing out prematurely. 
  B: The argument presents a true conditional statement. Neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly is a necessary condition to cause tires to wear out prematurely.
  C: The argument presents an irrelevant conclusion. The premises state that car owners who neglect to check the tire pressure regularly are unaware of the consequences, but the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
  D: The argument presents a true conditional statement. Neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly is a necessary condition to cause tires to wear out prematurely.
  E: The argument presents an irrelevant conclusion. The premises state that driving a car on gravel roads can cause the tire to wear out prematurely, but the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument above presents a conditional statement and concludes a result based on a flaw due to insufficient evidence.
  A: The argument presents a sound pattern of reasoning with conditional statements that support the conclusion.
  B: The argument presents a valid argument with a conditional statement but does not present insufficient evidence.
  C: The argument presents a different pattern of reasoning as it presents a premise and an assumption.
  D: The argument presents a similar pattern of reasoning by presenting insupportable evidence and drawing a conclusion based on false premises.
  E: The argument presents a different pattern of reasoning as it presents a separate condition that will lead to the same conclusion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument makes a conditional claim (if squirrels eat from a bird feeder, then it will not attract many birds) and then makes another conditional claim (squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover), and then draws a conclusion based on those two conditional claims (a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover).
  
  A: This argument is a valid conditional argument.
  B: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes a conditional claim and then another claim about the condition, but it is valid.
  C: This argument does not have the same structure as the original argument.
  D: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes a conditional claim and then another claim about the condition, but it is valid.
  E: This argument does not have the same structure as the original argument.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument above makes an error in assuming that squirrels eat from bird feeders only if they lack a protective cover.
  A: The argument presents a logical sequence of events and their causes, and there is no clear error in reasoning.
  B: The argument presents a logical sequence of events and their causes, and there is no clear error in reasoning.
  C: The argument presents a conditional statement, a statement of fact, and a conclusion. The conditional statement about car owners checking tire pressure regularly is not logically linked to the conclusion that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: The argument presents a logical sequence of events and their causes, and there is no clear error in reasoning.
  E: The argument presents two potential causes for tire wear, but does not make a clear error in reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument presents a conditional statement where the premise is:
- If a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, squirrels will eat from it
- Squirrels eating from the bird feeder will not attract many birds
- Thus, a bird feeder lacking a protective cover will not attract many birds

A: This argument presents a similar conditional argument. If a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely. The argument proceeds to state the reverse relation that if tire wear out prematurely, then likely it was caused by low tire pressure.
B: This argument presents a similar naive conditional argument. If a car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly, then the tire will wear out prematurely.
C: This argument presents a causal argument where it is suggested that making car owners aware of the consequences of neglecting to check tire pressure will reduce the likelihood of tire wear.
D: This argument presents a similar naive conditional argument to B.
E: This argument presents a conditional argument with two possible causes of tire wear. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The argument above presents a conditional statement in the form of "If P then Q". The argument then concludes that "If not Q then not P", which is not a valid logic to follow.
A: This argument presents a valid logic as it states that "If checking the tire pressure regularly (P) then the tires will not wear out prematurely (Q)" and vice versa.
B: This argument presents a valid logic as it states that "If not checking the tire pressure regularly (not P) then the tires will wear out prematurely (Q)" and vice versa.
C: This argument concludes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure, which is not related to the original argument.
D: This argument presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument, as it states that "If not checking the tire pressure regularly (not P) then the tires will wear out prematurely (Q)" and concludes that "If the tires do not wear out prematurely (not Q) then the car owner did not neglect to check the pressure regularly (not P)".
E: This argument presents a different issue than the original argument and does not contribute to the discussion.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument uses conditional statements to conclude that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  A: The argument structure is not similar to the one in option A.
  B: The argument structure is similar to the one in option B because it concludes that the tires will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, using conditional statements.
  C: The argument structure is not similar to the one in option C.
  D: The argument structure is not identical to the one in option D because it concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, using conditional statements, but the conclusion is not conditional statements.
  E: The argument structure is not similar to the one in option E.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument states that people who watch a lot of television are more likely to think they will be victims of a natural disaster than those who don't watch as much TV.
A: This choice doesn't address the specific link between watching TV and overestimating the dangers of a natural disaster. It only states that many people overestimate dangers regardless of how much television they watch. This is not enough to weaken the reasoning in the argument.
B: This choice is irrelevant to the argument and doesn't address the link between watching TV and overestimating the dangers of a natural disaster.
C: This choice strengthens the argument by suggesting that people who don't watch a lot of television have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
D: This choice weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well informed about natural disaster risks can become informed in ways other than watching television, which suggests that watching TV may not be necessary for understanding these risks.
E: This choice doesn't address the specific link between watching TV and overestimating the dangers of a natural disaster. It only implies that those who live in an area prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more TV, which is not enough to weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks posed by natural disasters.
  It uses the correlation between watching an above-average amount of television and overestimating the risks posed by natural disasters to support its claim.
  
A: This statement does not address the argument's claim or provide evidence that the correlation between watching too much television and overestimating the risks posed by natural disasters is not strong.
B: This statement goes against the argument's claim by saying that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in areas that are prone to natural disasters.
C: This statement goes against the argument's claim by saying that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
D: This statement weakens the argument's claim by suggesting that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some other way rather than by watching television.
E: This statement does not address the argument's claim or provide evidence that the correlation between watching too much television and overestimating the risks posed by natural disasters is not strong.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument states that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
A: This statement does not refute the argument. It is possible that many people overestimate the dangers, regardless of their television habits, but the argument is specifically referencing the impact of television viewing on this estimation.
B: This statement suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television may be less likely to be in an area prone to natural disasters. This information does not necessarily weaken the argument, as it could still be true that those who watch more TV are more likely to overestimate the risks in areas prone to natural disasters.
C:If people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have an accurate perception of natural disaster risk, this would weaken the argument, suggesting that television viewing habits do impact perceived disaster risk.
D: This statement supports the argument, as it suggests that television viewing is not the only way people become well informed about natural disasters.
E: This statement does not refute the argument. It is possible that those who live in areas prone to natural disasters may watch more television due to their location and that location may also make them more prone to overestimating their risks.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risk of being a victim of a natural disaster.
A: This statement does not address the impact of television on the estimation of the risk.
B: This statement contradicts the argument and suggests that watching an above-average amount of television may lead to a decreased likelihood of living in an area that is prone to natural disasters.
C: This statement supports the argument, reinforcing the idea that watching television is a factor that influences the estimation of the risk.
D: This statement suggests that there are other means to become well-informed about the risks of natural disasters besides watching television, which can weaken the argument.
E: This statement also contradicts the argument, suggesting that watching an above-average amount of television may be a result of living in an area that is prone to natural disasters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. And it gives a study as evidence to support this claim.
A: This option does not weaken the reasoning above since it accepts the existence of overestimation among people.
B: This option is out of scope since it doesn't address the impact of television on people's estimation but the likelihood of natural disasters.
C: This option strengthens the reasoning above since it claims that people who watch a below-average amount of TV have a more accurate idea than those who watch an above-average amount of TV.
D: This option weakens the reasoning above since it provides another source for people to become well informed of the risks posed by natural disasters other than watching TV. 
E: This option is out of scope since it doesn't address the impact of television on people's estimation but the correlation between TV watching and the likelihood of natural disasters.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument concludes that people who watch more television are more likely to overestimate the risks posed by natural disasters. 
A: This statement acknowledges that many people overestimate the dangers of the world regardless of watching television, which does not weaken the conclusion that watching too much television can lead to overestimation of risks.
B: This statement is not directly relevant to the argument. It's comparing people who watch an above-average amount of television to people who watch a below-average amount of television. The argument is concerned with the relationship between television watching and the risk of overestimating the likelihood of a natural disaster.
C: This statement strengthens the conclusion that people who watch less television are less likely to overestimate the risks posed by natural disasters, which is the opposite of what the argument claims. Therefore, it weakens the argument.
D: This statement does not weaken the argument. It suggests that people can become informed about the risks posed by natural disasters in ways other than watching television. However, it does not address whether watching television can lead to an overestimation of risk.
E: This statement is also not relevant to the argument. It suggests a correlation between television watching and living in an area that is prone to natural disasters, but does not address the argument that watching too much television leads to overestimation of risk. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them and people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
  
A: This statement implies that overestimating dangers is not entirely related to watching TV, which weakens the argument. However, this statement does not directly refute the conclusion that watching too much television can lead to overestimating risks.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it is discussing the likelihood of where a person lives, not how their television viewing habits affect their perception of natural disasters.
C: If people who watch less tv still have an accurate understanding of natural disaster risks, then the argument that watching too much TV affects perception of natural disasters would be strengthened by C being false.
D: This statement suggests that there are other ways people can become knowledgeable about natural disasters, thus weakening the argument that watching too much tv is solely responsible for people overestimating natural disaster risks.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it is discussing the likelihood of where a person lives, not how their television viewing habits affect their perception of natural disasters.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The reasoning suggests that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  A: This answer choice does not weaken the argument by suggesting that other people also overestimate risks. It is not about the relationship between television and risk estimation.
  B: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument. It is about the relationship between natural disasters and television, but not about how watching television affects perceptions of the risks of natural disasters.
  C: This answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting that people who watch a below-average amount of television have a more accurate perception of the risks of natural disasters. This suggests that watching television may lead to overestimation of risks.
  D: This answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well informed about risks do not become so by watching television. This implies that television is not the only or primary source of information about natural disaster risks.
  E: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument. It is about the relationship between natural disasters and television, but not about how watching television affects perceptions of the risks of natural disasters.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks posed by natural disasters. 

A: This choice implies that overestimating risks is not necessarily caused by watching too much television, which does not weaken the argument.
B: This choice does not necessarily weaken the argument, because it does not address the question of whether watching too much television leads to overestimating the risk of natural disasters.
C: This choice supports the argument, because it implies that people who watch less television have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of natural disasters.
D: This choice weakens the argument, because it suggests that people who are well-informed about the risks of natural disasters are not likely to have become so by watching television.
E: This choice does not weaken the argument, because it does not address the question of whether watching too much television leads to overestimating the risk of natural disasters.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that a small study's results are valid because the author has been doing excellent work for years, although some critics point out that the small sample size is a weakness.
  A: Although the study focuses on chameleons, it does not generalize behavioral conclusions about chameleons to all lizards.
  B: The argument does not address how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production.
  C: The argument does briefly mention the study's critics before addressing their objection, and indeed the argument defends the study against the objection by discussing the author's qualifications, but the argument's initial focus is on the study, not the author.
  D: Although the argument does not address whether the critics have relevant expertise, the argument does not rely on the idea that the critics lack relevant expertise.
  E: Since the argument defends the study's author, it would be difficult to say that it holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's argument is that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of Vitamin D, and that the study's small sample size does not invalidate the results because the author is a respected professional who has been doing excellent work for years.
A: This is not a vulnerable point in the reasoning presented.
B: The argument provides an explanation for why chameleons bask in the sun. This is not a vulnerable point in the reasoning presented.
C: The argument does mention the study's author, but it does not focus exclusively on the author and does not dismiss the study's results as valid simply because of the author's reputation. This is not a vulnerable point in the reasoning presented.
D: The argument does not address whether the study's critics have relevant expertise, so this is not a vulnerable point in the reasoning presented.
E: The argument does suggest that the study's author should be trusted because he is a respected professional who has been doing excellent work for years. This is a vulnerable point in the reasoning since it implies that the author's conclusions are valid based on his reputation alone.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that despite the small sample size, the study's author is a professional and has done excellent work over the years, so the study's results are valid. 
  A: The argument doesn't necessarily take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole. It only states that the study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate vitamin D production.
  B: The argument doesn't fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun. It only states that the study concluded that they did.
  C: The argument does focus on the study's author, suggesting that the author's expertise and reputation lend credibility to the study's results, rather than addressing potential flaws in the study.
  D: The argument does not address the expertise of the study's critics, so it cannot demonstrate whether or not they have a relevant expertise.
  E: The argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The biologist claims that the critics are wrong to doubt the results of the study and that the sample size was small but the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  
A: The biologist does focus on chameleons but not lizards as a whole; the argument is not vulnerable to criticism on this ground.
B: The argument does not mention or discuss the details of how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production; the argument is not vulnerable to criticism on this ground.
C: The biologist's argument does focus on the author of the study, but the argument does not ignore the study itself; the argument is not vulnerable to criticism on this ground.
D: The argument does not aim to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise; the argument is not vulnerable to criticism on this ground.
E: The biologist's argument does not explicitly or implicitly hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics; the argument is not vulnerable to criticism on this ground.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. This is because the argument dismisses the critics' doubt on the basis of the author's professional reputation and past work without addressing the criticism directly. Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to the criticism that it is using a faulty standard of evaluation by dismissing criticism based solely on the reputation of the author. The argument is not vulnerable to the other criticisms.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their vitamin D production and the sample size of the study was small.
  A: The biologist's argument doesn't take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole. The argument only talks about chameleons but not all lizards.
  B: The argument explains that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Therefore, it doesn't fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
  C: The argument does mention the study's author to counter the critics' claim that doubt the results of the study due to the small sample size. However, it does not focus more on the study's author than on the study itself.
  D: The argument does not address whether the study's critics have relevant expertise or not.
  E: The argument is not holding the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The biologist only cited the author's experience to support the credibility of the study. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist concludes that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Critics of the study argue that its sample size was very small.
  The study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  
Analysis: 
  The biologist's argument is that the study's results are not doubted by the critics just because the author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years. This reasoning is flawed because the credibility of the author does not necessarily guarantee the accuracy of the study's results. The validity of the argument depends on the strength of the research methodology and the evidence presented, rather than on the author's reputation. Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The biologist's study is about chameleons and their behavior in basking in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  A: The biologist only talks about chameleons in the study, so the argument is not generalizing the behavior of all lizards.
  B: The study's conclusion is that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their vitamin D production. Therefore, this criticism is not applicable.
  C: The argument mentions the study's author in order to establish the author's professional reputation and expertise. However, it does not dismiss the study's critics' counterarguments.
  D: The argument does not address the expertise of the study's critics. Therefore, this criticism is not applicable.
  E: This criticism does not accurately reflect the biologist's argument.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The biologist's study concludes that chameleons bask for warmth and to regulate vitamin D.
- The sample size of the study is very small but the author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.

Analysis:
- The argument may be vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the small sample size of six chameleons may not be enough to generalize to all lizards.
- The argument is not vulnerable to criticism on the grounds of failing to explain how chameleons regulate vitamin D by basking in the sun, as the argument already concluded that chameleons bask for that reason.
- The argument is also not vulnerable to criticism on the grounds of focusing on the author rather than the study, as it brings up the author's credentials to counter the criticism made towards the study.
- It is not clear whether the study's critics have relevant expertise.
- The argument doesn't hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D, in addition to getting warmth. 
  Critics of the study didn't find the sample size of six chameleons to be representative.
  The author of the study is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years. 
Choice: 
  A: The biologist's argument doesn't take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to all lizards, but rather specifically mentions "lizards such as chameleons."
  B: The biologist's argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production.
  C: The biologist's argument does not exclusively focus on the study's author, but rather addresses both the critics and the study's author.
  D: The biologist's argument does not claim that the critics lack relevant expertise.
  E: The biologist's argument doesn't hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that, since the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant, the increasing subscription rates suggest that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  A: This statement provides information on how university libraries are adapting to the increasing journal subscription costs via increased fines, but does not weaken the argument itself.
  B: This statement does not address the argument directly, and does not provide any additional information about the profitability of scholarly journals.
  C: This statement supports the argument and does not weaken it.
  D: If the subscription rates for individuals have not increased as they have for libraries, then this weakens the argument that publishing a scholarly journal is more profitable by showing that the increased subscription rates are specific to libraries.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors in hospitals has resulted in a decrease in patient injuries caused by such errors, as the knowledge that the errors are being monitored has made the staff more cautious.
  A: The argument is not about investigating staff errors that cause life-threatening injuries, but rather recording staff errors.
  B: The argument is about hospitals that implemented the plan, not about hospitals that did not.
  C: This weakens the argument because it means that the plan did not capture all staff errors that could have caused injuries.
  D: If the decrease in incidence did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, it strengthens the argument that the plan was effective in reducing patient injuries by increasing staffs' attention to their duties.
  E: This information is not relevant to the argument about whether the plan was effective in reducing patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Several regional hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors and this reduced the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
- The decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff becoming more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties because they knew their errors were being carefully monitored.

A: This statement describes a policy that existed before the implementation of the plan. It does not relate to the impact of the implemented plan and therefore does not strengthen the argument.
B: This statement implies that there may be other factors that could have caused the decrease in patient injuries at the non-participating hospital and therefore weakens the argument. 
C: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that there may be errors that have been overlooked and not recorded under the plan. 
D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was caused by the plan since the staff had to become aware that their errors were being monitored.
E: This statement is irrelevant because it does not strengthen nor weaken the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record all staff errors to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from such errors, and the incidence of injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. The knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient. - This information is not relevant to how the hospitals reduced the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors after implementing the plan.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question. - This information actually weakens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries may not be entirely due to the plan implemented by the hospitals.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not. - This information is not relevant to how the hospitals reduced the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors after implementing the plan.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. - If the decrease in patient injuries began only after the staff became aware that records were being closely analyzed, it supports the argument that knowledge of monitoring made the hospitals staff more careful in carrying out their patient care duties. Hence, this option strengthens the argument.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors. - This information is not relevant to how the hospitals reduced the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors after implementing the plan.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors in order to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
  - The incidence of patient injuries substantially decreased at these hospitals since then.
  - The knowledge that staff errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  
A: This statement provides information about a pre-existing policy related to a specific type of patient injury. However, it does not provide any information that would strengthen or weaken the given argument.
B: This statement is about a hospital that did not participate in the plan. The argument is about hospitals that did participate in the plan. Therefore, this statement is not relevant to the argument and does not strengthen or weaken it.
C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be related to the implemented plan. If the plan did not require the recording of certain types of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries, then it is possible that the decrease in injuries is due to other factors.
D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in the incidence of injuries is due to the implemented plan. It suggests that the knowledge that the hospitals' staff errors were being closely monitored was a key factor in the decrease in injuries.
E: This statement provides information about the consequences of staff errors. However, it does not provide any information that would strengthen or weaken the given argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors has decreased since the implementation of a plan to systematically record all such errors, and that this decrease is due to the staff becoming more meticulous in carrying out their duties because they knew their errors were being monitored.
  A: This statement is not relevant. It talks about what happened before the plan was implemented and about a specific type of error that causes life-threatening injury, while the argument focuses on all staff errors. 
  B: This statement weakens the argument, as it suggests the decrease in patient injuries was not necessarily due to the implementation of the plan since a hospital that did not participate in the plan also saw a decrease in injuries.
  C: This statement is not relevant. It talks about errors that could have caused injuries but did not, while the argument focuses on errors that did cause injuries.
  D: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in injuries was due to the staff becoming more meticulous once they became aware their errors were being monitored.
  E: This statement is not relevant. It talks about the consequences for staff members who made errors, while the argument focuses on the implementation of a plan to reduce patient injuries resulting from staff errors.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  1. Regional hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors to reduce patient injuries caused by staff errors.
  2. The incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then.
  3. Knowledge of being monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  
  A: This statement, even if true, does not strengthen the argument because it only talks about the policy that was already in place before implementing the plan of systematic recording of errors.
  B: This statement, if true, weakens the argument because it indicates that the incidence of injuries decreased at another hospital that did not participate in the plan. This suggests that there are other reasons for the decrease in the incidence of injuries.
  C: This statement, if true, weakens the argument because it suggests the plan was not comprehensive enough in recording staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in the incidence of injuries was caused by the staff members being aware of the monitoring of their errors.
  E: This statement is unrelated to the argument and does not help to explain why the incidence of injuries decreased after the implementation of the plan.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - A plan was implemented to record all staff errors that cause patient injuries.
  - The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at hospitals that implemented the plan.
  - The reason for the decrease is that the staffs became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient. --> This statement provides additional information about the policy of the hospitals, but it does not strengthen the argument that the knowledge of being monitored made the staff more meticulous.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question. --> This statement provides an alternative explanation for the decrease in patient injuries. It weakens, rather than strengthens, the argument that the plan was responsible for the decrease in patient injuries.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not. --> This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as the plan only aimed to systematically record all errors that did cause patient injuries, not errors that could have but did not cause patient injuries.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. --> This statement strongly supports the argument, as it directly links the knowledge of being monitored to the decrease in patient injuries.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors. --> This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not address the issue of whether the plan was responsible for the decrease in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors related to patient injuries.
  The incidence of such injuries decreased since the implementation of the plan.
  The staff became more careful after the implementation of the plan.

A: The hospitals had a policy in place to investigate errors but it does not strengthen the argument that the knowledge of monitoring the errors led to the decrease in injuries.
B: The decrease in patient injuries at a regional hospital not participating in the plan is irrelevant to the argument.
C: The plan only focused on errors that resulted in patient injuries and not on errors that could have caused injuries but did not, so this does not impact the argument.
D: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that the awareness of close monitoring under the plan led to the decrease in injuries.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument as it describes the approach taken for those found accountable for errors.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The plan to record staff errors in order to reduce the number of patient injuries has been implemented in several regional hospitals.
  The incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased since the implementation of the plan.
  The plan made the hospitals' staffs more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  
A: This statement does not address the effectiveness of the plan in reducing patient injuries.
B: The decrease in patient injuries at the hospital that did not participate in the plan could be due to other factors. This statement does not provide a link between the plan and the decrease in patient injuries.
C: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to record all errors that could have caused patient injuries.
D: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries may be attributed to the plan which made the staff more meticulous in carrying out their duties after becoming aware that their errors were being monitored.
E: This statement does not address the effectiveness of the plan in reducing patient injuries.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument posits that the plan implemented a year ago to systematically record staff errors has led to a decrease in patient injuries at participating hospitals. The reason for this is because staff members knew that their errors would be recorded, thus making them more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  
A: This option does not provide any information on the effect of the implementation of the plan. It presents information about an existing policy that is not relevant to the argument at hand. 
B: This option provides information regarding the incidence of patient injuries at a non-participating hospital. Since the argument only discusses the effect of the plan at the participating hospitals, this option is not relevant to the argument at hand. 
C: This option suggests that the plan may not be comprehensive since staff errors that did not result in patient injuries were not recorded. This information does not necessarily strengthen the argument that the plan has resulted in a decrease in patient injuries at participating hospitals.
D: This option strengthens the argument by suggesting that the knowledge that their errors were being closely monitored was what led to staff members being more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
E: This option does not provide any information on the effect of the implementation of the plan. It provides information on the consequences of staff members making errors that cause patient injuries, which is irrelevant to the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Knowledge: The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because the current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did, and there are no methods that produce zero pollution. 
 A: This is not mentioned in the CEO's argument.
 B: This is also not mentioned in the CEO's argument.
 C: The CEO uses the specific criticism of not being environmentally responsible to argue that the corporation is responsible because they pollute less than before and no method produces zero pollution.
 D: The CEO does not necessarily claim that the company has completely succeeded but argues that they are environmentally responsible because of their efforts to reduce pollution.
 E: This is not mentioned in the CEO's argument.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The CEO's argument assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. This assumption is flawed because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed, which is not a logical conclusion. Answer A correctly identifies this flaw in the CEO's reasoning. The CEO's argument is not based on the possibility that production methods that do not produce pollution could be developed in the future. Therefore, the argument is flawed.
Response 2:
Knowledge: The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because its current production methods produce significantly less pollution than their old methods, and there are no methods that produce no pollution. 
A: The CEO does not explicitly assume that production methods which do not produce pollution cannot be developed.
B: The CEO does not compare different causes or effects.
C: The CEO is generalizing from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. 
D: The CEO does not assume that they succeeded in reducing the amount of pollution produced but states that the current production methods produce significantly less pollution than their old methods.
E: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is that there are no methods that can produce no pollution and that the company has already reduced its pollution as much as possible.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The CEO is trying to support the idea that the corporation is environmentally responsible as it pollutes significantly less than its old methods did. The argument is also that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
A: The CEO is not discussing the development of production methods that do not produce pollution, so this choice is irrelevant.
B: The CEO is not discussing the effect of different causes, so this choice is irrelevant.
C: Generalizing hastily from a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms is not relevant to the CEO's argument.
D: This choice is not correct as the CEO is not taking for granted that because they attempted to reduce pollution, they have succeeded. He is claiming that the current method pollutes less than the old one.
E: The correct choice is (E). The CEO takes for granted that there are currently no production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The CEO's argument implies that there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution. This assumption takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. This is a flaw in the reasoning because it assumes that current methods are the best and that there is no way to advance technology to develop cleaner methods. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Options B, C, D and E do not accurately describe the flaw in the CEO's reasoning.
Response 5:
Knowledge: The CEO argues that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute less than their old methods, and there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution. However, the argument does not consider other possibilities.
A: The argument does take for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed.
B: The argument does not mention anything about different causes having similar effects. This is not relevant.
C: The argument does generalize too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms by stating that the corporation is environmentally responsible when only one class of criticism has been addressed.
D: The argument does take for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded.
E: The argument does ignore the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The CEO's argument assumes that because the company has reduced its pollution output compared to its older methods, they are an environmentally responsible corporation. However, it is possible that there are other criticisms of the corporation's environmental responsibility that are still valid. By relying on a specific criticism and generalizing from it to all criticisms, the CEO is making a hasty generalization. Therefore, choice C is the best answer. Option A is not mentioned in the argument. Option B is not relevant to the argument. Option D is partially true, but the argument is not entirely based on that assumption. Option E is also not mentioned in the argument.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")

The CEO's argument is flawed as he/she generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. The CEO argues that since their current production methods pollute less than their old methods and there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, they are environmentally responsible. However, this argument does not consider the possibility that there may be other criticisms of their environmental responsibility that are not related to pollution. Therefore, the reasoning suffers from a hasty generalization fallacy.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. The CEO assumes that there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution, which is an assumption that may be inaccurate as there may be innovative options that the company may not be aware of.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The CEO's reasoning is flawed because he/she takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. This is a flaw in the CEO's argument because it is entirely possible for new, more innovative methods that produce little to no pollution to be developed.

Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile
  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered
  E: the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile
Response 0:
Knowledge: Larew and Mendota have different views on how to measure the economic prosperity of different income quintiles. Larew thinks that the increase in average income of the lowest quintile is a better measure of economic prosperity compared to the highest quintile.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument: to protect wildlife, future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats, and thus development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.
- Figorian Development Commission's argument: Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, so it should be allowed; they also argue they have the right to govern their own resources.
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. If this assumption is incorrect, and the specially constructed replacement wetlands cannot support the wildlife in the same way as natural wetlands can, then the development of wetlands may still cause a net reduction of wetlands and pose a threat to the species that inhabit them.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument is that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife and that development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.
  The Figorian Development Commission's argument is that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth and that they have as much right to govern their own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the number of species endangered by the development of wetlands compared to other types of development.
B: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does depend on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, as this is the basis for the proposed solution of offsetting wetland development with the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is focused on the regulation of wetland development in industrialized nations and does not depend on the regulation of wetland development in primarily agricultural nations.
D: Although the Figorian Wildlife Commission cites past regulation as evidence of its efficacy, the argument as presented does not depend on past performance.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on whether the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetlands development in Figoria must be offset by the construction of replacement wetlands to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that wetland development in Figoria is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
  A: The argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on more species being endangered by wetland development than by any other type of development.
  B: The argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in replacement wetlands.
  C: The argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission concerns wetland development in industrialized nations and does not address the regulation of wetland development in agricultural nations.
  D: The argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not directly depend on the past success of Figorian regulation of development in protecting and preserving wildlife.
  E: The argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on the level of threat to Figorian wetland species compared to other endangered species.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues for the regulation of wetland development in Figoria to protect wildlife, while the Figorian Development Commission argues that it is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
  A: The argument does not depend on this assumption.
  B: This assumption is necessary because the Figorian Wildlife Commission proposes constructing replacement wetlands. If the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats cannot survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, then the regulation proposed by the Figorian Wildlife Commission would not be effective.
  C: The argument does not address nations that are primarily agricultural, so this assumption is not necessary.
  D: This assumption supports the argument but is not necessary for the argument to hold.
  E: The argument does not depend on this assumption.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that to protect wildlife, future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption, because the argument is about wetland development, not about other types of development.
B: This assumption is critical to the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission because the argument depends on the idea that the replacement wetland habitats will provide a suitable environment for the endangered species.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption, because the argument is not about agricultural nations.
D: This assumption supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not crucial to the argument.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption, because the argument does not rely on the perceived severity of the threat to the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife and that this would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.
The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth and that they have as much right to govern their resources as other countries.

A: The argument by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption. 
B: This assumption is essential to the argument presented by the Figorian Wildlife Commission because it suggests that the construction of replacement wetland habitats would not have a negative impact on wildlife, thereby making it a viable solution to the problem of endangerment of species. 
C: The argument by the Figorian Wildlife Commission is focused on the regulation of wetland development in industrialized nations, not nations that are primarily agricultural. Therefore, it does not depend on this assumption. 
D: This assumption is not essential to the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission because the argument is about what should happen in the future, not what has happened in the past.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission proposes a regulation to offset the development of wetlands with the construction of replacement wetlands.
  The Figorian Development Commission opposes the regulation and argues for allowing development, claiming that wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  The question asks for an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends.
  
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on more species being endangered by the development of wetlands than any other types of development. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument. 
B: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. This assumption is reasonable, but it is not the only one. 
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on nations that are primarily agricultural. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that Figorian regulation of development has protected and preserved wildlife in the past. This assumption is relevant, but it is not the only one. 
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on whether the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Figorian Wildlife Commission proposes that any future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that Figoria has as much right to govern its own resources as other countries.
  
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on whether more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than by any other type of development. This is irrelevant to the argument. 
B: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. If these species do not survive in those replacement wetlands, then the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission fails to achieve its goal: to protect wildlife. 
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is about Figoria, not nations that are primarily agricultural, so this statement is irrelevant to the argument. 
D: This answer choice is a statement about the past, and the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is about the future. Thus, this statement is irrelevant to the argument. 
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on whether the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species. This is irrelevant to the argument. 

Action: Answer("B")

Asumptions:
  A: There is no information in the passage to support this assumption.
  B: This assumption is necessary for the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission that development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. 
  C: This assumption is not supported by the passage. 
  D: This assumption supports the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not necessary for their argument. 
  E: This assumption is not required for the arguments put forward by either commission. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission states that to protect wildlife, the development of wetlands in Figoria must be regulated and offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. It should be ensured that development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. 
A: The argument does not depend on the assumption that more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development. 
B: The argument depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands as the development of new wetlands may affect the natural habitat and living conditions of existing wildlife.
C: The argument is not concerned with nations that are primarily agricultural and does not depend on the assumption that wetland development in such countries does not need to be regulated. 
D: This assumption is more of a reverse assumption for the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission. 
E: The argument does not depend on the assumption that the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence to identify the responsible individual or entity based on the type and quantity of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night, and the need for stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility.
  A: This principle is directly in line with the reasoning given in the argument as it discusses the need for greater certainty of guilt when imposing a severe penalty.
  B: This principle does not directly speak to the issue of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence to identify the responsible party.
  C: This principle addresses the severity of the penalty but not the issue of insufficient evidence to identify the party responsible for the infraction.
  D: This principle discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense, but it does not address the issue of insufficient evidence to identify the responsible party.
  E: This principle is similar to the principle in (A) but is less specific to the issue raised in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the penalty for the pollution is severe and that stronger evidence is needed or a confession from the polluter in order to be certain of their identity before imposing the penalty. The argument also suggests that the severity of the penalty is a factor in determining certainty.

A: This principle aligns with the argument's reasoning and supports the idea that stronger evidence or a confession is needed before imposing a severe penalty.
B: This principle discusses the balancing of deterrence and severity, but is not directly relevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: This principle discusses proportionality, but does not directly address certainty of guilt or the severity of the penalty as factors in determination.
D: This principle may be true, but does not directly address the argument's reasoning or the need for stronger evidence or a confession.
E: This principle aligns with the argument's reasoning and supports the idea that severity of penalty should not prevent certainty of guilt.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument is discussing the justifiability of imposing a severe penalty and argues that stronger evidence or the admission of responsibility is required before imposing such a penalty. This is an example of the principle of evidence, which states that "the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party." Therefore, A is the best answer. B, C, D, and E are not directly relevant to the reasoning in the argument.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about imposing a penalty for pollution.
  The pollution is believed to have come from a local auto repair shop.
  The evidence is not strong enough to justify imposing the penalty because it is severe and the identity of the polluter is not certain.
A: This principle supports the reasoning in the argument because it claims that the more severe the penalty is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
B: This principle is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument since it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
C: This principle is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument since it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
D: This principle is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument since it talks about the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense, and not about the certainty of their guilt.
E: This principle most directly supports the reasoning in the argument because it claims that the severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument is discussing the challenge of imposing a penalty for pollution when the identity of the polluter is uncertain. The argument suggests that stronger evidence is needed or admission of responsibility by the perpetrator before a penalty can be imposed. 
A: This principle aligns with the argument. It suggests that the severity of the penalty needs to be proportional to the level of certainty of the perpetrator's guilt.
B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's discussion of the reliability of evidence and certainty of guilt.
C: This principle suggests that the level of harm caused by the infraction is the key factor in determining the severity of the penalty, which is not the primary concern in the argument.
D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument's discussion of the reliability of evidence and certainty of guilt.
E: This principle aligns with the argument. It suggests that the severity of the penalty cannot be so great that it is used when guilt is uncertain, which is precisely the point made by the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
The argument stated that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, the penalty for the type of pollution that entered the river cannot be imposed, even if it is sufficiently certain that the local auto repair shop is responsible. 
A: This principle supports the argument by stating that one must be more certain of the guilt of a party before imposing a more severe penalty, which is consistent with the argument's position of not imposing the penalty without sufficient evidence.
B: This principle is tangential to the argument, as the argument is not discussing the appropriate severity of penalties, but rather the need for stronger evidence or a confession for imposing a penalty.
C: This principle is also tangential to the argument, as the argument is not discussing the appropriate severity of penalties based on the harm caused by the infraction, but rather the need for stronger evidence or a confession to justify imposing a penalty.
D: This principle is irrelevant to the argument, as the argument does not discuss the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for the offense.
E: This principle supports the argument by stating that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense, which is consistent with the argument's position of not imposing the penalty without sufficient evidence.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
The argument is about how certain the investigators need to be in order to justify imposing a severe penalty on the perpetrator of the pollution in the river. 

A: This principle suggests that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing it. This principle helps to justify the reasoning in the argument. 
B: This principle discusses the ideal severity of penalties for crimes; it is not directly relevant to the argument. 
C: This principle discusses a different aspect of how penalties should be determined based on the harm caused by the infraction; it is not directly relevant to the argument. 
D: This principle discusses why someone may be unlikely to admit responsibility when the penalty for an offense is severe; it is not directly relevant to the argument. 
E: This principle suggests that the severity of the offense should not be so great that certainty of guilt is impossible. This principle is similar to the argument's reasoning, but it is not as precisely focused on the question of penalty severity. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument is discussing the difficulty of justifying imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence or admission of responsibility. 
A: This principle supports the reasoning in the argument. Imposing severe penalties requires certainty of guilt to ensure that the penalty is not unjustly imposed.
B: This principle discusses the severity of penalties but does not directly address the issue of evidence or certainty necessary for imposing penalties.
C: This principle suggests that penalties should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction, but it does not directly address the issue of evidence or certainty necessary for imposing penalties.
D: This principle suggests that severe penalties may discourage people from admitting responsibility, but it does not directly address the issue of evidence or certainty necessary for imposing penalties.
E: This principle directly supports the reasoning in the argument. The severity of the penalty should not be so great that certainty of guilt cannot be established before imposing the penalty.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about whether the penalty for pollution can or cannot be imposed due to the lack of conclusive evidence.
  A: This principle relates to the level of certainty necessary to impose a penalty. It is relevant for this argument, as the penalty for pollution must be certain to be justified.
  B: This principle is about finding the right balance in the severity of the penalty. It is not directly relevant to the argument.
  C: This principle relates to the proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused. While it is relevant, it is not as directly connected to the argument as choice A.
  D: This principle implies that severe penalties could discourage people from coming forward and admitting responsibility. However, the argument is not focused on the possibility of someone coming forward but in the lack of evidence to support the imposition of the penalty.
  E: This principle is similar to choice A in that it addresses the level of certainty necessary for punishment to be justified.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether the penalty for the type of pollution that the auto repair shop caused should be imposed or not. The evidence so far is not conclusive enough. 
  A: This principle affirms the reasoning in the argument. The argument is that the penalty is so severe that it requires strong evidence or admission of responsibility. 
  B: This principle is about the severity of penalties being just right, nothing to do with the argument. 
  C: This principle is about the proportionality of the penalty with the harm caused, nothing to do with the argument. 
  D: This principle is not relevant to the argument. It talks about the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense. 
  E: This principle seems to argue against the reasoning in the argument, which is that the penalty is too severe for the evidence available.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The columnist is opposing a proposal that suggests using extra money collected by a water utility for something other than building a dam.
  - The columnist believes that the extra money should only be used for water-related projects.

A: This is not directly relevant to the judgment being made by the columnist.
B: This is related to the issue of whether the money should be used for a project that benefits only some members of a community versus the community as a whole, but it is not directly relevant to the legitimacy of the legislator's proposal.
C: This option is very close to the columnist's position as it asserts that the extra charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that does not have the approval of most of the utility's customers.
D: The option is not directly relevant as it does not address the main issue which is the use of extra charges by the water utility.
E: The principle is relevant to the issue of the use of extra charges collected by a water utility.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist thinks that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable. 
  The government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills to build a dam. 
  The legislator proposed to use that extra money from water bills to build new roads.
  
A: This principle would suggest that the customers have the right to know how the money is being used but does not justify the columnist's judgement that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
B: This principle would support the columnist's judgement that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable as the money collected for the dam project would benefit the entire community, while the legislator's proposed use of the additional revenue benefits only some members of the community.
C: This principle would justify the customers' disapproval of the dam building project, but it does not directly justify the columnist's judgement that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
D: This principle deals with the approval process of the additional charge on water bills, but it does not justify the columnist's judgement that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
E: This principle deals with the water utility's collection of an additional charge on water bills, but it does not justify the columnist's judgement that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills to build a dam. 
  A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.
  The columnist thinks that proposal is unacceptable, but it is not clear why. 
Choice:
  E: This principle could be relevant if the utility's customers are mostly opposed to building the dam, but the question does not provide us with this information.
  B: This principle is relevant since the money collected on water bills for a project that benefits the community as a whole should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  D: This principle is not relevant because the utility has already received the approval to collect the additional charge on water bills.
  C: This principle is not relevant since the question does not tell us how many customers are for or against building the dam.
  A: This principle is not relevant since the question does not provide information on whether the customers of the utility know how their money will be used or not.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The columnist thinks that the legislator's proposal to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building the dam is not acceptable.
  A: This principle is related to the right of information for customers, but it does not justify the columnist's judgment.
  B: This principle is related to the idea that money collected for a specific purpose should not be used for a different purpose that only benefits some members of the community.
  C: This principle is related to whether most of the customers of the water utility approve the project or not, but it does not justify the columnist's judgment.
  D: This principle is related to the approval process for imposing an additional charge on water bills, but it does not justify the columnist's judgment.
  E: This principle is related to the use of an additional charge on water bills for water-related expenditures, which supports the columnist's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The columnist is against spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam that the government-owned water utility has received approval for.
  
A: This principle is not directly related to the issue of the proposal to use the money from water bills to build new roads rather than a dam.
B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community is not directly related to the issue of the proposal to use the money from water bills to build new roads rather than a dam.
C: This principle is related to the issue of the proposal to use the money from water bills to build new roads rather than a dam. But, it does not justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.

E: This principle is related to the issue of the proposal to use the money from water bills to build new roads rather than a dam. But, it does not justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.

Action: Answer("B")  
The principle that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community justifies the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist believes that it is unacceptable to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  A: This principle is not relevant to the issue of whether the extra money from water bills should be used to build a dam or new roads.
  B: This principle supports the idea that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should be used to build a dam that benefits the community, rather than using it to build roads that benefit only a portion of the community.
  C: This principle is not relevant because the proposal is not about using the extra charge to fund a project most customers disapprove of.
  D: This principle is not relevant because it does not address the issue of whether the extra money from water bills should be used to build a dam or new roads.
  E: This principle supports the idea that a water utility should only collect an additional charge if the money collected is used for water-related expenditures, such as building a dam to ensure adequate water supply for customers. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist thinks that using the extra money collected on water bills to build new roads instead of a dam is unacceptable. 
  A: This principle is not relevant to the issue in question.

  C: The proposal to use the money from water bills to build new roads does not violate this principle, and it is not relevant to the columnist's argument.
  D: This principle is not relevant to the columnist's argument since it does not address whether the proposal to use the money from water bills to build new roads is acceptable or not.
  E: This principle is relevant to the columnist's argument since it suggests that additional charges on water bills should only be used for water-related expenditures. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam.
  A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.
  The columnist thinks that proposal is unacceptable.
  
A: This principle is relevant to the issue of transparency but it does not address the question of whether the legislator's proposal is acceptable or not.
  
B: This principle suggests that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community. According to the information provided, the legislator's proposal to spend the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam does not necessarily violate this principle.

C: This principle suggests that an additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of. According to the information provided, the utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. Thus, this principle does not address the issue.

D: This principle states that an additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature. According to the information provided, the utility has already received approval to collect an additional charge and to use the additional revenue to build a dam. Thus, this principle does not address the issue.

E: This principle suggests that a water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures. According to the information provided, the utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. The construction of a dam generally serves a water-related expenditure while the building of new roads does not necessarily. Therefore, this principle helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  A: This principle addresses the right of the customers to know where their money is going, but it is not directly relevant to the judgment of the proposal's acceptability.
  B: This principle states that the money collected from the utility's customers should be used for projects that benefit the whole community, which supports the argument against building a dam instead of building roads.
  C: This principle states that the additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of, but it does not support the argument against building roads instead of the dam.
  D: This principle addresses the legislature's approval of the additional charge and is not directly relevant to the judgment of the proposal's acceptability.
  E: This principle states that the water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures, which is not directly relevant to the judgment of the proposal's acceptability.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
 - Florida panthers are endangered and there are 70 to 100 of them alive today.
 - Their population needs to reach 250 or more to be self-sustaining.
 - Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.

Analysis:
 - Choice A is a possibility, but there is no conclusive evidence to support it from the given statements.
 - Choice B is incorrect, as there are no assurances that a population of 250 will be self-sustaining.
 - Choice C is supported by the statement that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
 - Choice D is not supported by the given statements, since the current population is already a significant increase over their numbers in the 1970s.
 - Choice E is contradicted by the information that their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Florida panthers are an endangered species.
  - The current population of Florida panthers is 70 to 100.
  - The population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  - The current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  
A: There is no information in the given context that supports or refutes this statement. Hence, it cannot be the correct answer.
B: This statement contradicts the given context as the context states that the population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Hence, this statement cannot be the correct answer.
C: This statement correctly summarizes the information provided in the given context. Hence, this is the correct answer.
D: There is no information in the given context that supports or refutes this statement. Hence, it cannot be the correct answer.
E: The context presents no information regarding the size of the habitat in the 1970s or today. Hence, it cannot be the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The Florida panther population has been increasing since the 1970s.
  - The current population of Florida panthers is 70 to 100, which is still below the required number of 250 to be self-sustaining.
  - The current habitat of the panthers cannot support any more of these animals.
  
Analysis:
  - Option A is a possibility, but it is not necessarily true based on the given information.
  - Option B cannot be inferred from the given information, as it is stated that the population must be at least 250 to be self-sustaining.
  - Option C can be inferred from the given information, as it is stated that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals and their population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining.
  - Option D is not necessarily true based on the given information, as the population has been increasing since the 1970s.
  - Option E is not necessarily true based on the given information, as it is only stated that the population has increased since the 1970s, not that their habitat has also increased.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The population of Florida panthers has increased but must reach at least 250 for self-sustainability.
  - Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat may be of marginal quality, but it is not necessarily true, and it is not a required conclusion from the given facts.
  B: The statement is not necessarily true since self-sustainability requires a larger habitat, which the current one cannot support.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, it is not possible for their population to be self-sustaining. This is a required conclusion from the given facts.
  D: The given facts do not support this statement. It is not possible to determine this based on the given information.
  E: The given facts do not support this statement. The habitat's size is not mentioned in comparison to the 1970s.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Florida panthers' numbers must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining but their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  A: The passage only mentions the size of their habitat, not the quality.
  B: The passage does not suggest that a population of over 250 panthers would be self-sustaining, nor does it suggest that reaching that number guarantees self-sustainability.
  C: The passage states that the current habitat is not large enough to support more panthers than are currently present, and that the panther population needs a larger habitat to be self-sustaining.
  D: The passage does not state that the population of Florida panthers will never increase beyond its current level, but it suggests that a larger habitat is necessary for the population to increase.
  E: The passage does not state that Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat today than they did in the 1970s. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  1. There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today.
  2. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s.
  3. Population needs to reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  4. Current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.

Analysis:
  Statement 1 and 2 implies that the population of Florida panthers has increased over the years.
  Statement 3 indicates the minimum population size needed for self-sustaining.
  Statement 4 implies that the current habitat is already saturated and hence cannot support more panthers.

Answer: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The most logical conclusion from the given statements is that unless there is a larger habitat, the current panther population will not be self-sustaining.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The Florida panther population needs to be at least 250 individuals to be self-sustaining, but current habitat cannot support any more of these animals.
  
A: The fact that some part of the panthers' current habitat is marginal quality is not mentioned in the context and cannot be determined by the given information.
B: The context does not provide sufficient information to support a conclusion about what will happen if the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250. 
C: The context states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals and that their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Therefore, if Florida panthers do not acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining. 
D: The context does not provide information suggesting that the Florida panther population will never increase much beyond its current level. 
E: The context says nothing about whether today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The Florida panther population is currently between 70 to 100.
  This population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  The current habitat is not large enough to accommodate more panthers.
  
A: This may or may not be true, but it is not a necessary conclusion from the statements given.
B: This statement is not supported by the information provided. 
C: This statement follows logically from the information provided. 
D: This statement is not supported by the information provided, as the population has increased significantly from its 1970s numbers. 
E: The information provided does not necessarily support this statement; it is possible that the habitat has remained the same size or even decreased since the 1970s. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The population of Florida panthers must be at least 250 to be self-sustaining.
  - Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  
A: There is no direct information that supports this statement. The marginal quality of the panthers' habitat is not mentioned in the context.
B: The statement is not true. The context says that the population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. 
C: This statement is supported by the context. It says their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, so unless they acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
D: This statement is not supported in the context. The context says that the current population of Florida panthers is between 70 to 100 which is much larger than their numbers in the 1970s.
E: There is no information in the context that supports this statement.  

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The number of Florida panthers alive today is between 70 and 100.
  The current population of Florida panthers is not large enough to be self-sustaining.
  The panther's current habitat is not large enough to support more of these animals.
  
Option analysis:
  A: This may or may not be true, as the statement does not provide evidence supporting or rejecting the quality of the panther's habitat.
  B: This is not necessarily true, since the statement only indicates a minimum number of 250 panthers required for a self-sustaining population.
  C: This must be true, as the statement explicitly states that the current habitat is not large enough to support more panthers than currently exist.
  D: This is not necessarily true, as the statement mentions that the population has increased greatly since the 1970s, though it does not indicate if it will continue to do so or not.
  E: This is not necessarily true, as the statement does not provide information about the size of the panther's habitat in the 1970s.

B: This statement accurately reflects the professor's argument that epic poems transmit values by presenting heroic figures as role models. 
C: The statement is partially true and consistent with the professor's argument that values are not always explicitly discussed in poetry. However, the statement is too strong; it suggests that values are rarely, if ever, set forth explicitly, which is an overgeneralization. 
D: This statement accurately reflects the professor's argument that heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live for many groups of people. 
E: This statement is not true according to the given information. The professor did not suggest that only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The Professor believes that Epic poetry does not discuss values explicitly, but rather embodies values in heroic figures to present them as role models. Imitation of those role models gives meaning and direction to the listeners' lives.
  A: The passage discusses that the most important function of epic poetry is to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it, so this statement is true.
  B: The passage states that epic poetry's most important function is to transmit values by presenting heroic figures as role models, so this statement is true.
  C: The passage does not discuss whether values represented in poetry are rarely or ever set forth explicitly, so this statement is not necessarily true.
  D: The passage suggests that heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live, so this statement is true.
  E: The passage does not claim that only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values through heroic figures as role models.
- The transmission of values is not explicit but rather embodied in those figures, who are meant to be imitated as role models.
- There is no indication that this is true only for epic poetry, or that it is the only important function of poetry.
- There is no indication that the values in poetry are rarely or never set forth explicitly. This may be a feature specific to epic poetry, but it is not necessarily true for all poetry.
- The professor suggests that this function is important for the group of people in question, but not necessarily for all groups.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The professor is discussing the function of epic poetry.
  He states that epic poetry transmits values by embodying them in heroic figures, who are presented as role models.
  He notes that imitation of these figures gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poem.
  
A: The professor did not make a definitive statement on whether this is true of all poetry, so we cannot say that this must also be true.
B: The professor explicitly states that this is how epic poems accomplish their most important function.
C: The professor states that values are not explicitly set forth, but this does not imply that this is the case for all poetry.
D: The professor's statements support this as a likely inference, but he does not explicitly state it as a "must."
E: The professor did not make a definitive statement on whether this is true of all poetry, so we cannot say that this must also be true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the function of epic poetry to transmit values by which a group of people is to live by presenting heroic figures as role models. The passage also states that the transmission of those values is not explicit but rather embodied in the heroic figures. 

A: Although the passage discusses poetry and its function, this choice goes beyond the scope of the passage discussing the function of poetry in general. 
B: The passage clearly states that epic poetry accomplishes its most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models. 
C: The passage states that values are not explicitly discussed in epic poetry, but it does not say that this is rare for all poetry. 
D: The passage discusses epic poetry and heroic figures as role models for a group of people to live by based on their values, supporting this choice. 
E: The passage discusses epic poetry and its function, but this choice is too extreme by stating that only epic poetry serves this function. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The professor argues that epic poetry's most important function is to transmit values by presenting heroic figures as role models.
- It is suggested that the embodiment of values in poetry is not explicit, but rather is implicit in the depiction of heroic figures.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
According to the professor's statements, epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models. Therefore, (B) is the best answer. While (A), (C), and (D) may be true to some extent, none of them accurately reflect the arguments made by the professor. (E) is incorrect because the professor's argument does not suggest that only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. 
  A: This choice states that the argument overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. However, the advertisement already states that the reported savings are an average. 
  B: This choice is about the average amount paid by people who hold Popelka Auto Insurance policies. However, the advertisement does not compare the average amounts paid by different groups of people.
  C: This choice states that the argument fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. However, the advertisement does not compare Popelka Auto Insurance with other insurance companies.
  D: This choice states that the argument takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. However, the advertisement does not say anything about whether the savings were underestimated.
  E: This choice states that the argument fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. However, the advertisement does not make any claims about the representation of people who can save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a survey showed that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Therefore, it is suggested that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  
A: This option points out a possibility that the argument is overlooking - that some new Popelka customers may have reported little or no savings. However, this does not weaken the argument that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka. Thus, this is not the best answer.
  
B: This option is out of context. The advertisement does not mention the duration of the policyholders' relationship with Popelka Auto Insurance, so it cannot assume that new policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance than do people who have held such policies for a longer period of time.

C: This option suggests that other insurance companies may offer even more savings than Popelka, and therefore, switching to them would be preferable from a saving standpoint. This option weakens the argument and suggests an alternative option.

D: This option suggests that the survey results may have some errors in measuring how much they saved. However, it does not weaken the argument that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.

E: This option suggests that there is a disproportionate representation of people capable of saving hundreds of dollars switching to Popelka among the new Popelka policyholders. However, it does not weaken the argument that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  A: This option identifies a possibility that the advertisement overlooks, which is that some new policyholders may not have saved any money when they switched to Popelka.
  B: This option suggests that the claim in the advertisement may not be true because it assumes that new policyholders pay more than older policyholders.
  C: This option raises a possibility that the advertisement fails to address, which is that other insurance companies might offer even greater savings than Popelka.
  D: This option assumes that the new Popelka policyholders do not overestimate their savings, but it does not identify a vulnerability in the argument.
  E: This option suggests that the sample used in the survey is not representative of the general population because it assumes that people who are capable of saving money by switching auto insurance are overrepresented among the new Popelka policyholders.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. 
  A: This option criticizes the advertisement for overlooking the possibility that some new policyholders may have not saved as much money as others. However, the advertisement only claims that the sample of policyholders surveyed reported an average savings of $250 a year, and therefore this option is not the most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds of overlooking possibilities.
  B: This option takes for granted that new policyholders pay more for their auto insurance, on average, than people who have held policies for a longer period of time. However, the advertisement does not make such an assumption and therefore this option is not the most vulnerable to criticism.
  C: This option criticizes the advertisement for failing to address the possibility that other insurance companies could save policyholders more money than Popelka. This is a valid criticism of the argument in the advertisement, as it assumes that Popelka offers the best possible savings for policyholders, without considering the possibility that other companies might offer even more savings.
  D: This option takes for granted that few, if any, policyholders underestimated their savings. However, the advertisement doesn't make this assumption, and therefore this option is not the most vulnerable to criticism.
  E: This option criticizes the advertisement for failing to address the possibility that the sample of policyholders surveyed may not be representative of all policyholders who could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka. This is a valid criticism of the argument in the advertisement, as it assumes that the sample surveyed by Popelka is representative of all policyholders who could save money by switching to Popelka, without considering that other groups may be different.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The advertisement claims that new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders saved $250 a year on average as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. It concludes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
A: The argument considers that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported saving an average of $250 a year, but it overlooks the possibility that at least some of them saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. However, this does not necessarily weaken the argument that most people can save money by switching to Popelka.
B: The argument does not assume that the new and old Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay the same for their auto insurance, so this answer choice is incorrect.
C: The argument recognizes that there may be other insurance companies that would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. However, this does not necessarily weaken the argument that most people can save money by switching to Popelka.
D: The argument assumes that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed accurately reported their savings. However, this does not necessarily weaken the argument that most people can save money by switching to Popelka.
E: The argument does not make assumptions about the demographic characteristics of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders, so this answer choice is incorrect.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  A: This criticism, if valid, would suggest that the $250 savings figure is not representative and could be higher or lower than that for some policyholders.
  B: This criticism is not relevant since the argument is not concerned with the pricing of policies.
  C: This criticism, if valid, would suggest that other insurance companies could offer even better savings, and the argument would be weakened.
  D: This criticism is not relevant since the argument is not concerned with the accuracy of the self-reported savings figures.
  E: This criticism, if valid, would suggest that the sample of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders may not be representative of all auto insurance policyholders and that the $250 savings figure may not apply to the broader population.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that a survey of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders showed they saved $250 a year, on average, by switching to Popelka.
  The argument in the advertisement concludes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
A: This choice correctly identifies a weakness in the argument. If some policyholders saved little or no money by switching, then the average savings of $250 may not be representative of the savings that most people could expect by switching.
B: This choice is not a weakness of the argument and is not relevant to the conclusion.
C: This choice is not a weakness of the argument and is not relevant to the conclusion.
D: This choice may or may not be a weakness of the argument, but it is not the most vulnerable criticism among the options listed.
E: This choice is not a weakness of the argument and is not relevant to the conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that a survey of Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders revealed an average saving of $250 a year as a result of switching to Popelka.
  A: This is a possibility, but the argument in the advertisement is about how MOST people could save by switching to Popelka and does not address the outcomes for ALL policyholders.
  B: The argument does not assume that new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less than longtime policyholders; instead, it only claims that new policyholders saved an average of $250 a year by switching to Popelka.
  C: This is a possibility, but the advertisement is not about whether other insurance companies could save policyholders more money than Popelka could, but about how most people could save by switching to Popelka.
  D: The argument does not make any assumptions about whether policyholders underestimated the amount they saved when they switched to Popelka.
  E: This is a possibility, but the argument does not assume that people who can save hundreds of dollars by switching are disproportionately represented among the new policyholders surveyed.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average.
  The advertisement concludes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka. 
A: This criticism is valid if at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. However, the advertisement states that the sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average. So, this is not the most vulnerable ground to criticism.
B: This criticism is not relevant to the argument made in the advertisement.
C: This criticism is plausible as the advertisement does not compare the savings to other insurance companies.
D: This criticism is not relevant to the argument made in the advertisement.
E: This criticism is not relevant to the argument made in the advertisement.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported saving an average of $250 a year by switching to Popelka.
  A: This choice attacks the representativeness of the sample used in the survey conducted by Popelka Auto Insurance and suggests that the results may not be generalizable to all new policyholders.
  B: This choice is irrelevant to the argument made in the advertisement because the argument only concerns new policyholders who switch to Popelka, not people who have held policies with Popelka for a longer period of time.
  C: This choice suggests that switching to another insurance company could save policyholders more money than switching to Popelka would, but the advertisement only claims that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka, not that Popelka offers the best rates in the market.
  D: This choice is irrelevant to the argument made in the advertisement because it concerns the accuracy of the savings estimates reported by policyholders, not the validity of the claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  E: This choice suggests that the sample of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders may not be representative of the general population, but it does not challenge the claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  There are two groups of doctors - one group wants to treat newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin while the second group argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  
A: This answer choice provides information about the treatment to reduce bilirubin levels in newborns and negative side effects. However, it does not support or oppose the position of the second group of doctors.
  
B: If some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, then it is more likely that bilirubin will enter the brain, even if the levels are not excessively high. This supports the position of the second group of doctors.
  
C: This answer choice provides information, but it is not relevant to the issue of bilirubin levels in the brain.
  
D: Bilirubin neutralizing potentially damaging substances is not related to the position of either group of doctors.
  
E: This answer choice provides information about general agreement among one group of doctors, but it does not support or oppose the position of the second group of doctors.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns.
  A second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  We are asked to find which option supports the position of the second group of doctors.
  
Analysis: 
  Option A addresses the safety of treatment, but doesn't support either group's position.
  Option B supports the position of the second group of doctors, as it provides a situation in which the brain's natural defenses may be weakened.
  Option C provides information about bilirubin, but doesn't relate to any of the positions.
  Option D provides information about bilirubin, but again doesn't relate to any of the positions.
  Option E mentions the general agreement among doctors who recommend treating newborns, but again doesn't relate to any of the positions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns.
  A second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  
A: This statement provides helpful information regarding the treatment, but does not support the position of the second group of doctors about the brain's natural defenses.
B: If some diseases occurring in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defense, it would support the position of the second group of doctors who argue for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
C: This statement provides information regarding where the pigment bilirubin occurs, but does not support the position of the second group of doctors about the brain's natural defenses.
D: Although bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth, it does not directly support the position of the second group of doctors about the brain's natural defenses.
E: This statement provides information regarding the agreement among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, but it does not support the position of the second group of doctors about the brain's natural defenses.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The second group of doctors argue for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  A: The effectiveness of a treatment reducing high levels of bilirubin has no bearing on whether bilirubin levels in newborn babies should be left high or lowered.
  B: If some diseases occur in newborns that weaken the brain's natural defenses against bilirubin, this supports the position of the second group of doctors that argue for treating only when necessary to reduce high levels of bilirubin.
  C: The fact that bilirubin occurs in fluids involved in digestion does not support the second group of doctors' position.
  D: The neutralization of certain potentially damaging substances by bilirubin does not support the second group of doctors' position either.
  E: The level at which bilirubin is considered excessively high by doctors who treat newborns does not support the second group's position.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The first group of doctors treat newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, while the second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high.
  A: This statement does not support either group's position.
  B: This statement supports the position of the second group, since some diseases can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: This statement does not support either group's position.
  D: This statement does not support either group's position.
  E: This statement does not support either group's position.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The second group of doctors wants to allow the bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high because the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering. 
A: The effectiveness of the treatment and its side effects do not support the position of the second group of doctors.
B: This information supports the position of the second group of doctors, as it suggests that not all newborns will have strong enough natural defenses to protect them from high levels of bilirubin.
C: The occurrence of bilirubin in fluids involved in digestion is not relevant to the position of the second group of doctors.
D: The fact that bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances does not support the position of the second group of doctors.
E: The general agreement about excessively high levels among doctors who recommend treating newborns does not support the position of the second group of doctors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Bilirubin is a pigment found in blood.
  High levels of bilirubin in babies can cause tetanus, a neurological disorder.
  The second group of doctors argue that bilirubin levels in newborn babies should stay high because the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
A: This information provides support for the first group of doctors, but not the second.
B: This option supports the position of the second group of doctors, as some diseases may weaken the brain's natural defense system, which could lead to bilirubin entering the brain in newborns.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) was far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B (composed of college students). There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. 
  A: This information confirms a condition of the study, but does not relate to the conclusion being drawn from the study.
  B: This information confirms a condition of the study and helps to support the conclusion drawn by establishing that the two groups were treated the same.
  C: This information may help to explain the better performance of Group A, but it does not detract from the conclusion being drawn.
  D: This information confirms a condition of the study, but does not relate to the conclusion being drawn from the study.
  E: This information confirms a condition of the study, but does not relate to the conclusion being drawn from the study.
 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument claims that Group A (people aged sixty-five to seventy-five) performed better than Group B (college students) at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time. 
A: This fact does not seem to have a direct impact on the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages. It does not weaken or strengthen the argument. 
B: This fact does not seem to have a direct impact on the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages. It does not weaken or strengthen the argument. 
C: This fact does not seem to have a direct impact on the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages. It does not weaken or strengthen the argument. 
D: This fact supports the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, as both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls. 
E: This fact supports the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, as both groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared the ability of two groups, one composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old (Group A) and one composed of college students (Group B) to remember to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time. Group A proved far better at remembering to make the call than did Group B. The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  
A: This fact is important and helpful because it helps ensure that any difference in performance between Group A and Group B is due to age and not due to a difference in group size. 
B: This fact is important and helpful because it helps ensure that any difference in performance between Group A and Group B is not due to a difference in the researchers that handled the calls.
C: This fact is not helpful to establish whether the conclusion was properly drawn or not, as it does not relate to the comparison between the two groups or their performance in the study.
D: This fact is important and helpful because it helps ensure that any difference in performance between Group A and Group B is not due to a difference in access to telephones.
E: This fact is important and helpful because it helps ensure that any difference in performance between Group A and Group B is not due to a difference in the amount of time that the two groups had to prepare for the phone calls.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The study showed that Group A (65-75 years old) performed better than Group B (college students) in making telephone calls at a specified time.
  A: This is important to establish that both groups had similar conditions during the study.
  B: This is important to establish that both groups were evaluated under the same conditions.
  C: This statement provides additional information about the age distribution of Group B, but it does not affect the conclusion that Group A performed better.
  D: This is important to establish that both groups had equal access to the means of making the required calls.
  E: This is important to establish that both groups had similar timeframes to complete their tasks.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The study was conducted to compare the ability of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), to make a telephone call at a certain time. 
  Group A performed better than Group B with respect to making the telephone call at the specified time.
  The number of lapses was significantly higher in Group B compared to Group A.
  The conclusion of the study is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
  Choice A, B, D, and E all seem to be helpful in establishing the conclusion of the study. The fact that the number of people in each group was the same, the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, and the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls all appear to be relevant and helpful information in drawing the conclusion of the study. Choice C, however, is least helpful in establishing the conclusion, as the age of the college students is not directly related to the ability to remember to make a telephone call at a specified time.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The passage describes a study in which two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), were required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. 

A: This is helpful to establish that both groups were of equal size, making the study more reliable.
B: This is helpful to establish that the calls were answered by the same group of researchers, reducing the risk of bias.
C: This is not helpful in establishing the conclusion above as it does not relate to the study or the conclusion about the memory of different age groups.
D: This is helpful to establish that both groups had the same access to the resources needed to complete the task.
E: This is helpful to establish that both groups had the same amount of preparation time.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage discusses a recent study where two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), were required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. 

A: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it states that the number of people in each group was the same. This helps ensure that the groups were comparable and that the difference in performance was not simply due to a difference in group size.
B: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it ensures that the same researchers were answering the calls in both groups, which helps control for any variability in how the calls were answered.
C: This statement is not helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it doesn't have any relevance to the study. The age of the college students is not discussed in the passage and is not relevant to the comparison being made.
D: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups had the same opportunity to make the required calls.
E: This statement is helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups received their instructions with approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument states that the elderly people from the Group A are better than the college students from Group B in performing a certain memory-related task. The evidence cited is that Group A had only one lapse, while Group B had fourteen. The author concludes that "at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages."

The question is asking which of the following is the LEAST helpful in establishing the conclusion. Therefore, we need to find an option that is not related to memory or is not relevant to the conclusion.

Action: Answer("D") 
Option D is irrelevant to memory performance or the conclusion. Only one lapse in Group A compared to fourteen lapses in Group B is a clear indication of better memory by the elderly people. Option D stating that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones is not helpful in establishing the conclusion.
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the results of a study that compared two groups, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), on their ability to remember to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time. The study found that Group A had far fewer lapses than Group B, indicating a difference in memory ability between age groups.
 
A: This statement supports the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages because it establishes that the number of people in each group was equal. If the number of people in each group were different, it could have skewed the results and made it difficult to make conclusions about memory ability based on age. Therefore, this statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion.
 
B: This statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it establishes that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups. This ensures that any differences in answering the calls between groups were not due to differences in the way the calls were answered.
 
C: This statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it establishes that there were no persons more than forty years old among the college students. This helps to control for the effects of age on memory ability within Group B, making it more likely that any differences in memory ability between the two groups are due to age.
 
D: This statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it establishes that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones. This ensures that any differences in memory ability between the two groups were not due to differences in access to the tool required to remember to make the call at the specified time.
 
E: This statement is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it establishes that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls. This helps to control for the effects of time on memory ability, making it more likely that any differences in memory ability between the two groups are due to age. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage is discussing a study comparing the ability of elderly people and college students to remember to make a telephone call at a specified time. Group A (elderly people) performed much better than Group B (college students).
A: This information is helpful in ensuring that the groups were equal in number, but it does not impact the conclusion that elderly people performed better at remembering to make the phone call at the specified time.
B: This information is important to ensure that the methods used to record the data were the same for both groups, and therefore does not impact the conclusion that elderly people performed better at remembering to make the phone call at the specified time.
C: This information is also not relevant to the conclusion, as it only describes the age range of the college students and does not impact the conclusion that elderly people performed better.
D: This information is relevant to ensuring that both groups had equal access to resources for the task, but it does not impact the conclusion that elderly people performed better at remembering to make the phone call at the specified time.
E: This information is relevant to ensuring that both groups had the same amount of time to prepare for the task, but it does not impact the conclusion that elderly people performed better at remembering to make the phone call at the specified time.

Choices:
  A: the town has a relatively small number of houses
  B: inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe
  C: structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage
  D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe
  E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The resident's argument states that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects. Therefore, it can be inferred that the remaining 40% of the houses do not have these problems. 

A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument.
B: This statement is correct but does not address the flaw in the resident's argument.
C: This statement is also correct but does not address the flaw in the resident's argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The study found that the rare species of trees tend to survive longer than the most common species of trees in a particular forest.
A: This choice provides an explanation for why the most common species is well-suited to the local environment but does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
B: This choice provides a competing explanation for why the most common species reproduces the most but does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
C: This choice does not provide any helpful information in explaining why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
D: This choice provides a reason why it might be beneficial for tropical forests to have trees of the rarest species to survive longer but does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
E: This choice provides the most plausible explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer, namely that they face less competition for resources than the most common species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species, regardless of which species is the most common and which is the rarest in a particular forest.
  A: This statement provides some information on why the most common species thrives in a forest, but it does not explain why the rarest species tend to survive longer than the most common species.
  B: This statement provides information on the reproduction rate of older trees, but it does not explain why the rarest species tend to survive longer than the most common species.
  C: This statement provides information on the study design, but it does not explain why the rarest species tend to survive longer than the most common species.
  D: This statement provides some information on the benefit of the survival of the trees of the rarer species, but it does not explain why the rarest species tend to survive longer than the most common species.
  E: This statement offers a plausible explanation for why the rarest species tend to survive longer. If trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species, then the trees of the common species may be more likely to die due to resource limitations.

  The study found that the rarest species of trees tend to survive longer than the most common species in a particular forest.
Choices:
  A: This statement provides an explanation why the most common species of trees thrives in the forest, but it does not help to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than the most common species.
  B: This statement has nothing to do with the question posed.
  C: This statement provides no explanation to the observation that trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than the most common species.
  D: This statement provides some insight into the possible benefits of survival of trees of the rarer species, but it does not explain why trees of the rarer species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
  E: This statement explains that the trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species. This means that the trees of the rare species have more access to resources such as light, water and soil nutrients which may explain why they tend to survive longer than the most common species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The study found that the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest reproduces the most, and trees of the rarest species there tend to survive longer.
 
A: This statement provides a possible explanation for why the most common species reproduces more, but not why trees of the rarest species survive longer.
B: This statement is not relevant to the observation that trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than other trees.
C: This statement is not relevant to why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
D: This statement provides a possible explanation for why it might be beneficial for tropical forests to have trees of the rarest species survive longer, but not why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
E: This statement provides a possible explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The study found that the rarest species of trees in a forest tend to survive longer.
  The survival rate of rare species is not related to which species is the most common in the forest.
Choice analysis:
  A: This choice supports the idea that most common species thrives in the local climate, but it does not explain why the rarest species survives longer.
  B: This choice does not explain why the rarest species survives longer.
  C: This choice does not explain why the rarest species survives longer.
  D: This choice explains that the survival of rarer species is beneficial for the tropic forests, but it does not explain why the rarest species survives longer.
  E: This choice provides a logical explanation for why the rarest species survives longer in the tropical forests.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The study found that trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species in tropical forests regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
  
A: This statement does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
B: This statement does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
C: This statement does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
D: This statement provides an explanation for why the survival of trees of the rarer species is important, but it does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
E: This statement provides the best explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species: the trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species, which makes it harder for them to survive. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species in tropical forests. However, the study did not provide a clear explanation for this pattern. 
  A: This statement provides a potential explanation for why the most common species thrives but does not address why the rarest species tends to survive longer.
  B: This statement suggests a potential reason why older trees of a given species may not survive as long but does not explain why the rarest species tends to live longer than the most common species.
  C: This statement clarifies that the study only tracked preexisting species, but does not provide any explanation for the pattern observed.
  D: This statement provides a potential explanation for why the survival of trees of the rarest species might be beneficial, but still does not explain why the rarest species tends to survive longer than the most common species.
  E: This statement suggests a potential reason why trees of the most common species may not survive as long, which helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The study found that the rarest species of trees tend to survive longer in tropical forests compared to the most common species. 
A: This choice talks about why the most common species thrives in a forest, but it does not explain why rare species survive longer.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The Ethicist claims that we are justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
  Tolstoy's claim is that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  
A: This statement is not about the relation between knowledge and praise or blame for actions. It does not enable the conclusion of the Ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
B: This statement agrees with the Ethicist's claim that the information others possess about an action does not determine whether the person doing it is genuinely responsible. This statement enables the conclusion of the Ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
C: This statement is the Ethicist's claim. It does not enable the conclusion of the Ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
D: This statement suggests that our inclination to blame or praise the person who performed an action depends on the amount of information available to us, not on their responsibility for the action. It does not enable the conclusion of the Ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
E: This statement contradicts the Ethicist's claim that we are justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The ethicist argues that we are only justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The ethicist also rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.

A: This statement is not directly related to the conclusion being drawn by the ethicist, so it is incorrect.
B: This statement accurately reflects the conclusion drawn by the ethicist. Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. Therefore, we must know a lot about the events leading to an action before we can justify praising or blaming a person for that action. This is the correct answer. 
C: The ethicist argues the opposite of this statement, stating that we are only justified in praising or blaming a person for an action when we know a lot about the events leading up to that action. 
D: This statement could be true, but it is not directly related to the conclusion being drawn by the ethicist, so it is incorrect.
E: This statement is not supported by the argument presented by the ethicist, so it is incorrect.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for their action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action, and that Tolstoy's claim that if we knew more about those events we would cease to regard the action as freely performed is incorrect.
  A: This statement is related to whether a person should be blamed or praised for actions beyond their control, but it does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  B: If whether an act is genuinely the responsibility of the person doing it is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, then it supports the conclusion that we must know a lot about the events leading up to an action to justify praising or blaming the person who performed it.
  C: This statement is a restatement of the ethicist's premise, not an assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
  D: This statement is related to the degree of responsibility but does not directly link to the conclusion.
  E: This statement contravenes the ethicist's premise that we must know a lot about the events leading up to an action to justify praising or blaming the person who performed it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument presented indicates that there may be instances where a person is justifiably praised/blamed for an action, but only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The argument also suggests that Tolstoy's claim that knowledge of preceding events would cause us to no longer view an action as freely performed is incorrect.

A: This statement is in line with Tolstoy's claim and doesn't support the ethicist's argument.
B: This statement is in line with the ethicist's argument and supports the conclusion presented.
C: This statement does not acknowledge the role that knowledge of preceding events plays in determining whether an act is freely performed or not, and therefore doesn't support the argument.
D: This statement suggests that responsibility is not a matter of degree but doesn't address the role of knowledge in determining whether an act is worthy of praise/blame. It doesn't support the argument.
E: This statement is in line with Tolstoy's claim and doesn't support the ethicist's argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument of the ethicist is focused on praising or blaming a person for an action only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The argument counter the Tolstoy’s claim that “if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.”

A: This choice contradicts the ethicist's argument by stating that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. It does not enable the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
B: This choice supports the argument of the ethicist that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This choice enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
C: This choice is a restatement of the argument of the ethicist, and does not enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument of the ethicist that it is only when we have a lot of information that we can justify praise or blame, and it does not enable the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument of the ethicist, and it does not enable the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument of the ethicist is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that knowing the events leading up to any action will cause us to not regard that action as freely performed. The argument is based on the premise that we are only justified in praising or blaming a person for an action when we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
A: This statement opposes the idea of praising or blaming people for actions beyond their control, but it does not provide support for the conclusion of the argument.
B: This statement provides support for the conclusion of the argument, as it suggests that the responsibility of an action is not determined by how much information others possess about it.
C: This statement is similar to the premise of the argument, but it does not support the conclusion of the argument.
D: This statement suggests that our inclination to blame or praise someone varies with the amount of information available, which is consistent with the premise of the argument but it does not support the conclusion.
E: This statement opposes the idea that we can regard an action as freely performed if we do not know much about the events leading up to it, but it does not support the conclusion of the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The argument of the ethicist is that only if we know a lot about the events leading up to an action, we are justified in praising or blaming a person for that action. The assumption needed to draw the conclusion of this argument is that whether a person is genuinely responsible for an act is not determined by how much information others possess about the act. This assumption is captured in choice B and therefore enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn. A, C, D, and E are either irrelevant or go against the argument of the ethicist.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we have sufficient information about the events leading up to that action.
  A: This statement and the argument of the ethicist are not equivalent. Additionally, this statement is too extreme and does not necessarily follow from the premise.
  B: This statement aligns with the ethicist's argument, as it implies that the availability of information does not determine responsibility.
  C: This statement contradicts the argument of the ethicist and is therefore not a valid assumption.
  D: This statement suggests that the amount of information available affects the degree to which a person is praised or blamed, but it does not ensure that we are justified in praising or blaming.
  E: This statement contradicts the argument of the ethicist, suggesting that an action is freely performed when we do not know much about the events leading up to it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The ethicist is arguing against Tolstoy's claim that if we knew more about the events leading up to any action, we would see that person's actions as not freely performed. The argument must assume something that shows that knowing more about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily make us view the action as not freely performed. 
A: This choice provides an alternative view, but it does not directly relate to the conclusion of the argument about Tolstoy's claim. 
B: This choice affirms the argument, but it doesn't enable the conclusion to be properly drawn. 
C: This choice restates what the ethicist is saying in the argument. 
D: This choice affirms the argument and shows why it is valid. It shows that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, and the amount of information available affects our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action. 
E: This choice is almost the opposite of what the argument is saying because the argument says that we must know more about the events leading up to an action to properly praise or blame a person for that action. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only justify praise or blame for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action, and that Tolstoy's claim that knowing all about the events eliminates the concept of freely performed action is incorrect.
  A: This answer choice suggests that people are not responsible for actions caused by conditions beyond their control, but it does not support or enable the conclusion of the argument.
  B: This answer choice supports the argument's conclusion that the amount of information others possess about an act does not determine whether the person doing the act is genuinely responsible, and thus enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
  C: This answer choice simply restates the premise of the ethicist's argument and does not support or enable the conclusion of the argument.
  D: This answer choice suggests that responsibility for an action is not a matter of degree, but how much information is available affects our inclination to blame or praise the person who performed the action. This answer choice does not support or enable the conclusion of the argument.
  E: This answer choice suggests that knowing little about the events leading up to an action is what enables us to regard that action as freely performed, but it does not support or enable the conclusion of the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The question is asking for the option that would provide most support for the economists' assertion that planners could solve problems resulting from urbanization by trading urban goods or services for agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
  A: This option discusses government subsidies to urban manufacturers, but doesn't provide support for the economists' assertion.
  B: This option is a general statement that cannot directly support the economists' assertion.
  C: This option suggests that there is a scarcity of agricultural products that could be solved by trading goods or services produced by the urban population. This is consistent with the economists' assertion and provides some support for it.
  D: This option suggests that problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries, which is not relevant to the assertion of the economists.
  E: This option suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate problems caused by urbanization, which is not consistent with the economists' assertion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically would effectively solve the problems of increasing urbanization.
A: This statement talks about government subsidies to urban manufacturers, but it does not provide any support for the economists' assertion. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.
B: This option is a broad statement and does not provide support for the economists' assertion. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.
C: This option supports the economists' assertion as it suggests that the scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems caused by urbanization. This implies that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain agricultural products could solve these problems. Therefore, this option can be the correct answer.
D: This option suggests that problems associated with migration are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries. However, it doesn't provide any support for the economists' assertion. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.
E: This option suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization. This goes against the economists' assertion that trading goods or services could solve the problems of urbanization. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by urban population to obtain agricultural products that were previously produced domestically could help solve problems caused by increasing urbanization.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument presented is that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are evidently correct based on the results of a study that shows melatonin is effective at alleviating insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81.
  A: Inferring from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect is a type of causal fallacy, but there is no indication that the pharmacist is making this mistake.
  B: There is no mention of the opinions of biased individuals, so this does not appear to be the basis of the pharmacist's argument.
  C: There is no indication that the pharmacist is using two different meanings for the same term.
  D: The argument is that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because melatonin is effective at alleviating insomnia symptoms; there is no confusion of cause and effect here.
  E: There is no information provided to suggest that the sample of people used in the study is unrepresentative.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that a study of people aged 65-81 with insomnia showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates symptoms of insomnia. The argument then concludes that the claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are true.
A: This choice is not applicable to the given argument.
B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased. It refers to a large study conducted on people suffering from insomnia.
C: This choice is not applicable to the given argument.
D: This choice is the most accurate critique of the argument. The argument confuses an effect of a phenomenon (the alleviation of insomnia symptoms by ingesting melatonin) with its cause (the decrease in the production of melatonin).
E: The argument does not provide enough information to conclude that the sample used in the study is unrepresentative.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist believes that a study showed that ingesting melatonin can alleviate symptoms of insomnia in people aged 65-81. 
  The pharmacist believes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct. 
A: This choice is not applicable to the argument made by the pharmacist and is therefore incorrect.
B: There is no indication that the opinions relied on are biased. This choice is not applicable to the argument made by the pharmacist and is therefore incorrect.
C: There is no indication of using two different meanings for the same term in the argument made by the pharmacist. This choice is not applicable to the argument made by the pharmacist and is therefore incorrect.
D: The argument made by the pharmacist does not appear to confuse an effect with a cause. This choice is not applicable to the argument made by the pharmacist and is therefore incorrect.
E: The argument may be flawed in that the sample studied may not be representative of the larger population. This is a possible flaw in the argument made by the pharmacist.

The pharmacist's argument wrongly attributes causation, based on the correlation between melatonin consumption and symptoms alleviation. Just because there is a correlation between two variables (melatonin consumption and symptom relief), it doesn't mean that one is causing the other. In addition, the pharmacist's argument doesn't depend on two different meanings of the same term, nor does it rely on a biased sample or inferring intent from effect. Therefore, options A, B, C, and E are incorrect.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist argues that a large study showed that melatonin helps alleviate insomnia symptoms, and that claims made by the manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct.
  A: Inferring that an action is intended to produce a certain effect based on observed results is a common type of reasoning and is not inherently flawed. It is not applicable in this case.
  B: The argument does not rely on opinions of individuals; it instead relies on a study and the claims made by manufacturers which need to be supported by evidence.
  C: The argument does not use different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
  D: The argument does not confuse an effect with the cause of a phenomenon.
  E: The argument does not provide any information about whether the sample used in the study is representative or not.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist claims that melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms, which is supported by a study of people aged 65-81.
  The pharmacist claims that melatonin production decreases with age, which is not clearly supported by the given information.
  A: This choice is not applicable to the given argument.
  B: The argument does not rely on biased individuals.
  C: The argument does not depend on two different meanings of the same term.
  D: This choice could be a possible flaw, as the argument assumes that the decrease in melatonin production is the cause for alleviating insomnia symptoms, whereas the study only shows a correlation.
  E: The argument does not rely on an unrepresentative sample.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist is claiming that recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are evidently correct based on a study of people aged 65-81 suffering from insomnia that showed most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland.
  The pharmacist's argument is flawed.
A: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased.
  C: The argument does not depend on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
  D: The argument confuses the effect of melatonin on insomnia symptoms with the cause of the decrease in melatonin production in the pineal gland. The study's results do not provide evidence to support the claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  E: The argument does not rely on an unrepresentative sample.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The study showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland in the body.
  Recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.

Action: Answer("D")  
The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause. While it is correct that melatonin can alleviate insomnia symptoms, the argument assumes that the reason older adults produce less melatonin is due to age, when it could be due to other factors. The argument does not provide evidence that aging is the cause of the decreased melatonin production. Therefore, this is a classic case of confusing an effect with its cause.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The pharmacist argues that a study showed ingesting melatonin alleviated insomnia's symptoms in people aged 65-81, and he claims manufacturers' recent claims that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct. 
A: Inferring from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect is the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc. However, the argument does not show this fallacy because it does not claim that the ingestion of melatonin is necessarily the cause of the production of melatonin in the pineal gland.
B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased.
C: The argument uses the term "melatonin" in the same sense throughout and does not rely on two different meanings for the same term.
D: The argument does not confuse an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
E: The argument does not rely on an unrepresentative sample.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: 
The pharmacist's argument attributes the effect (the alleviation of insomnia's symptoms) to the cause (the increase in melatonin production from taking melatonin supplements), instead of merely pointing out a correlation between the two. In reality, the benefits of ingesting melatonin could be caused by a variety of factors, and it is impossible to confirm that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages based solely on this study. Therefore, the pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it confuses the effect of a phenomenon with its cause.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The physician argues that small magnets were effective at relieving chronic back pain.
  A: This choice raises the possibility that the patients in the first group who reported a significant reduction in pain merely thought they felt better because they knew they were receiving a treatment.
  B: This choice presents an alternative treatment (medication) that it states will relieve chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do. This does not directly address the effectiveness of magnets in the experiment.
  C: This choice points out that there is no other evidence that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area besides the back. This is not a direct refutation of the effectiveness of magnets in the experiment that was conducted.
  D: This choice does not directly refute the effectiveness of magnets in the experiment. It also suggests some scientists believed that magnetic fields relieve pain before the experiment was conducted, but it doesn't say anything about the experiment's results.
  E: This choice raises the possibility that the reduction in pain in the first group could be caused by variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The Physician made an argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain. 
  A: This statement does not necessarily counter the Physician's argument, as the Physician's experiment could still show a significant difference between the group who received small magnets to the back and the group who received no treatment that cannot be attributed to knowledge alone.
  B: The belief of most physicians is irrelevant to the validity of the experiment conducted by the Physician, which provided specific results.
  C: This statement does not necessarily counter the Physician's argument, as the Physician's experiment only focused on the use of magnetic fields on chronic back pain.
  D: This statement does not necessarily counter the Physician's argument, as the validity of the experiment does not depend on the beliefs of those who designed it.
  E: This statement could provide a counter to the Physician's argument by suggesting that the wide variation in the causes of the patients' chronic back pain may have impacted the results of the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The physician's argument is that the small magnets are effective at relieving some back pain, as observed from the participants who had magnets applied to their backs.
  The correct answer choice should undermine the physician's argument.

A: This statement is related to the placebo effect and does not necessarily dispute the effectiveness of magnets at relieving back pain.
B: The beliefs of most physicians are irrelevant to the effectiveness of magnets and do not undermine the physician's argument.
C: This statement does not dispute the effectiveness of magnets on relieving back pain.
D: This statement suggests that there may have been prior bias towards the use of magnets for back pain, but does not necessarily dispute the effectiveness of magnets at relieving back pain in this experiment.
E: This statement suggests that the effectiveness of magnets at relieving back pain may be due to differences in the specific causes of chronic back pain among participants.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that the application of small magnets to the backs of patients helped to significantly reduce chronic back pain in the majority of patients, while the group of patients that received no treatment did not experience significant pain relief. 
  A: This choice suggests that the improvement in the pain reported by patients could be due to their knowledge of receiving a treatment rather than the treatment itself. However, this weakens the argument rather than providing a logical counter. This is not the strongest counter to the physician's argument.
  B: This doesn't provide any new evidence that counters the physician's argument. The argument is about the effectiveness of magnetic fields vs no treatment, not medication vs magnetic fields.
  C: This choice suggests that there is no evidence that magnetic fields reduce pain in any other area of the body except for the back, but this has no impact on the effectiveness of magnetic fields on reducing back pain.
  D: This choice doesn't provide any new evidence that counters the physician's argument. The fact that certain scientists believed that magnetic fields relieve back pain doesn't impact the experiment's results.
  E: This choice suggests that there was a wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients, which could be a factor that influenced the patients' response to the magnets and weaken the argument that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain. This is the strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The physician's argument is based on an experiment that demonstrated that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  A: This statement is relevant but it does not provide a direct counter to the physician's argument.
  B: This statement is also relevant but it does not provide a direct counter to the physician's argument.
  C: This statement does not directly counter the physician's argument, but it raises questions about the generalizability of the results.
  D: This statement does not directly counter the physician's argument.
  E: This statement directly counters the physician's argument in suggesting that the variation in the causes of the back pain could explain the difference in pain reduction between the two groups.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  A: This option undermines the argument by suggesting that the patients could have experienced improvement just by knowing they were being treated, regardless of the effectiveness of magnetic fields.
  B: This statement is an alternate point of view, but it does not directly refute the physician's argument.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it is about magnetic fields reducing pain in other areas of the body, not about their effectiveness in reducing back pain.
  D: This statement is an alternate point of view, but it does not directly refute the physician's argument.
  E: This option could be a strong counter as it suggests that the observed reduction in pain in the first group may not be due to the magnetic fields, but instead to variations in the specific causes of the chronic back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the patients' knowledge of receiving the treatment could have led to improvement in their condition. This can weaken the validity of the physician's conclusion.
  B: This statement does not directly counter the physician's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that the conclusion is not robust and is limited only to the back pain. This may weaken the validity of the physician's claim.
  D: This statement does not directly counter the physician's argument.
  E: This statement suggests that the variation in the causes of the back pain could lead to a different response to the treatment. This can weaken the validity of the physician's conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The physician claims that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the results of an experiment in which 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups: one group received small magnets applied to their backs and the other group received no treatment. Most patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the second group did.
Choices:
  A: This choice indicates that the patients' knowledge that they have received treatment could be a confounding variable in the experiment. While this information is relevant in the design of experiments, it does not counter the physician's argument or the results of the experiment.
  B: This choice presents an alternative treatment for chronic back pain. However, the physician is not claiming that magnets are the most effective treatment; rather, they are probably effective. Therefore, this choice does not counter the physician's argument or the experiment.
  C: This choice presents a limitation of the experiment. However, it does not counter the physician's argument or the conclusion drawn from the experiment's results.
  D: This choice presents a potential issue with the experiment, but it does not counter the physician's argument or the conclusion drawn from the experiment's results.
  E: This choice suggests that the variation in specific causes of the chronic back pain could be a confounding variable. If this is true, the results of the experiment would be less reliable, and the conclusion that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain would be weaker. Therefore, this choice constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group who received magnets reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few patients in the second group who received no treatment reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the patients in the first group may have reported a reduction in pain due to the placebo effect and not the magnets actually producing a real effect.
  B: This statement suggests that physicians do not believe in the effectiveness of magnets, but it does not refute the physician's argument about the results of the experiment.
  C: This statement suggests that there is no evidence to support the use of magnets in relieving pain in other areas of the body, but it does not refute the physician's argument about the results of the back pain experiment. 
  D: This statement suggests that the scientists who helped design the experiment had a bias towards magnets, but it does not refute the physician's argument about the results of the experiment. 
  E: This statement suggests that the cause of chronic back pain may vary and therefore the effectiveness of magnets on all types of chronic back pain is not proven. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  A: This suggests that the mere knowledge of treatment on a patient may provide the patient a perceived improvement, even without actual improvement.
  B: This statement mentions an alternative treatment option and its efficacy, but it does not counter the physician's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that there is no empirical evidence to prove the effectiveness of magnetic fields on pain relief apart from the experiment mentioned in the argument, but it is not strong enough to counter the argument.
  D: This statement suggests the possibility of bias in the experiment, but it does not counter the argument itself.
  E: This statement suggests that there were variations in the causes of chronic back pain which could influence the effectiveness of magnet treatment, thus providing a strong counter to the physician's argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result?
Choices:
  A: For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
  B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.

Knowledge: 
  The hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers.
  Last week, all Maxlast hammers were put on a sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance, while Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Option A: It suggests that the initial moments of shoppers inside the store are not sufficient for them to take notice of the differences in prices, which means that the placement of the Maxlast hammers might not have had an effect on the shoppers. 
Option B: It suggests that the quality and service of the hardware store are of utmost importance to the customers, which means that the quality of the Styron hammers might have been better than Maxlast hammers, leading to the relatively higher sale of Styron hammers.
Option C: It suggests that the sale on Maxlast hammers prompted the customers to purchase the hammers, which means that the discount pricing led the customers to buy the Maxlast hammers. 
Option D: It suggests that the hardware store advertised the sale of Maxlast hammers, which means that the promotion might have attracted the attention of the customers, leading to the relatively higher sale of Styron hammers.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that Lopez may not have actually made the better arguments in the debate, given that survey respondents who thought she did may have been biased in her favor. 
  A: This fact, while potentially interesting, is not directly relevant to the argument being made.
  B: If most people in the live audience watching the debate and who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, that would undermine the argument by suggesting that Lopez may not have actually made the better arguments.
  C: This fact, while potentially interesting, does not directly undermine the argument being made.
  D: This fact, while potentially interesting, does not directly undermine the argument being made.
  E: This fact, while potentially interesting, does not directly undermine the argument being made.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is based on the assumption that the survey respondents' perception of Lopez's arguments made during the debate may have been biased. 
  A: This statement provides information about the voters who did not watch the debate, which is not directly relevant to the argument.
  B: This option undermines the argument because it suggests that the survey respondents who thought that Tanner made the better argument did not have the same bias as the respondents who favored Lopez.
  C: This option provides information about the correlation between watching the debate and voting for Tanner, which is not directly relevant to the argument.
  D: This statement provides information about the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate, which is not directly relevant to the argument.
  E: This option does not provide information about the perceived bias of the survey respondents who favored Lopez after watching the debate.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the viewers who reported Lopez's arguments as better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  A: This fact is not relevant to the argument.
  B: If most people in the live audience thought that Tanner was more persuasive, this would undermine the argument that the viewers who reported Lopez's arguments as better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  C: This fact might suggest that the people who watched the debate were less likely to vote for Lopez, but it does not directly undermine the argument.
  D: This fact might suggest that Tanner was more likely to win the election, but it does not directly undermine the argument.
  E: This fact might suggest that the viewers' perception of which candidate had better arguments was not related to the election outcome directly, but it does not directly undermine the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: There is a debate between Lopez and Tanner, and viewers surveyed tended to think that Lopez has better arguments. However, those viewers may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
A: This answer choice does not have any effect on the argument presented because it is discussing something unrelated to the debate or the survey conducted.
B: This answer choice weakens the argument by showing that the people who watched the debate in person did not agree with the surveyed viewers, indicating that the surveyed viewers may have been biased.
C: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument as it presents a new fact about the voting patterns of those who watched or did not watch the debate, which does not impact the initial survey.
D: This answer choice does not have any effect on the argument presented because it is discussing something unrelated to the debate or the survey conducted.
E: This answer choice does not affect the argument, as it only provides additional information about the margin by which Lopez won the election, which is not relevant to the survey conducted after the debate.

  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it does not impact the potential bias of the survey respondents who found Lopez's arguments to be better.
  B: This weakens the argument by suggesting that the survey respondents who favored Lopez may not be representative of the live audience.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it does not impact the potential bias of the survey respondents who found Lopez's arguments to be better.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it does not impact the potential bias of the survey respondents who found Lopez's arguments to be better.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. Although Lopez won the election by a narrow margin, it does not impact the potential bias of the survey respondents who found Lopez's arguments to be better. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument in question.
  B: This statement weakens the argument because it shows that the perceptions of the viewers surveyed immediately after the debate may not be representative of the audience as a whole.
  C: This statement does not affect the argument because it provides information about how likely debate viewers were to vote for Tanner, but does not speak to bias in the survey responses.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument in question.
  E: This statement does not affect the argument because it does not speak to bias in the survey responses. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  A: The fact that most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate does not undermine the argument that survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  B: If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, this would cast doubt on the accuracy of the survey results.
  C: The fact that the people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate does not undermine the argument that survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  D: The fact that most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner is not relevant to the argument that survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  E: The fact that Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin does not undermine the argument that survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument since it does not concern the possible bias of the viewers surveyed immediately after the debate.
  B: This statement undermines the argument by suggesting that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been representative of the live audience watching the debate.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument since it concerns the voting behavior of people who did not watch the debate, not the potential bias of the surveyed viewers.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument since it concerns the opinions of viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate, not the opinions of viewers surveyed immediately after the debate.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument since it concerns the margin of victory, not the potential bias of the surveyed viewers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The argument is that the viewers who said that Lopez won the debate may have been biased because Lopez won the election.
- A: This doesn't directly address the argument about bias of the viewers surveyed after the debate.
- B: This statement directly undermines the argument because now we have a different set of viewers who thought Tanner was more persuasive than Lopez.
- C: This statement does not address whether the viewers surveyed were biased towards Lopez due to his eventual victory.
- D: The opinions of viewers prior to the debate are not relevant to the argument.
- E: The margin of victory is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the viewers who said that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  A: This may weaken the argument that viewers were biased in favor of Lopez because the majority of voters did not watch the debate.
  B: This may not strongly weaken the argument that viewers were biased in favor of Lopez because the survey respondents were not limited to the live audience.
  C: This may not strongly weaken the argument that viewers were biased in favor of Lopez, as the argument is about a potential bias among those who did watch the debate.
  D: This may support the argument that viewers were biased in favor of Tanner, but it does not directly weaken the argument presented.
  E: This may not change the argument that viewers were biased in favor of Lopez, as the argument is not about the margin by which Lopez won.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

  B: This is not the flaw of the argument, as it does not address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences.
  C: This is not the flaw of the argument, as it does not simply favor the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing.
  D: This is the flaw of the argument. It concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted.
  E: This is not the flaw of the argument, as it does not address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument challenges the conclusion that the university president's speech was inappropriate solely based on Riley's testimony since Riley has a long-standing feud with the president.
  A: The argument does not necessarily take for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
  B: The argument does not address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences, but this is not necessary for the argument's main point.
  C: The argument does not favor the university president's side in the dispute, rather it argues that more evidence is needed before concluding that the speech was inappropriate.
  D: The argument does not simply conclude that Riley's claim is false because she has something to gain from it, rather it argues that more evidence is needed before concluding that the speech was inappropriate.
  E: The argument does not address whether Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded, rather it argues that more evidence is needed before concluding that the speech was inappropriate.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument concludes that the university president's speech was not inappropriate unless there are independent reasons to deem it inflammatory. 
  A: The argument does not take for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory. Rather, it concludes that unless there are independent reasons to deem the speech inflammatory, it was not inappropriate.

  C: The argument does not favor the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing. Rather, the argument is evaluating the appropriateness of the president's speech based on independent evidence.
  D: The argument does not conclude that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true. Rather, the argument evaluates the evidence for and against Riley's claim.
  E: The argument does not need to address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded in order to be a sound argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that we cannot conclude the speech was inappropriate solely on the basis of one person's testimony, especially when that person has a long-standing feud with the speaker. The argument concludes that there must be independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory.
  A: The argument does not take for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory. Rather, it argues that Riley's testimony alone is not sufficient to determine whether or not the speech was inappropriate.
  B: The argument does not fail to address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences. It simply argues that we need independent reasons to determine whether or not the speech was inflammatory in this case.
  C: The argument does not favor the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing. Rather, it cautions against accepting one person's testimony in a case where that person has a long-standing feud with the speaker.
  D: The argument does not conclude that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true. It simply argues that there must be independent reasons to determine whether or not the speech was inflammatory.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
The argument starts by saying that Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, the argument goes on to say that Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.

A: The argument does not suggest this.
B: The argument does not address this issue.
C: The argument does not suggest this.
D: The argument does not conclude that Riley's claim is false. Rather, the argument suggests that there must be independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory.
E: The argument does not address this issue.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about characterizing the president's speech as inflammatory and arguing that it was inappropriate, but we shouldn't solely rely on Riley's testimony. 
  A: The argument doesn't assume that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory; it only argues that we need independent reasons to deem it inappropriate.
  B: The argument doesn't disregard the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences; it only argues that we need independent reasons to deem it inappropriate.
  C: There is no information in the argument that suggests favoring the university president's side. On the contrary, the argument criticizes both the president's speech and Riley's testimony. 
  D: The argument doesn't conclude that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true; it only calls for independent reasons to support Riley's claim. 
  E: The argument doesn't address whether Riley's animosity toward the university president is well-founded or not. It only questions the reliability of Riley's testimony.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents Professor Riley's testimony about the university president's speech as a reason to not conclude that the speech was inappropriate; however, it also acknowledges that Riley has a long-standing feud with the president.
  A: The argument does not state or assume that the speech cannot be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
  B: The argument does not address the possibility of inflammatory speeches being appropriate for some audiences. It only addresses the appropriateness of the speech in question, given that it was deemed inflammatory by Professor Riley.
  C: The argument does not favor the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing. It acknowledges that Professor Riley has a long-standing feud with the president, which suggests a bias against the president.
  D: The argument concludes that Professor Riley's claim is false on the grounds that there are no independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, not merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true.
  E: The argument acknowledges the possibility of Professor Riley's animosity toward the university president being well founded. However, it argues that we should not conclude that the president's speech was inappropriate solely on the basis of Riley's testimony.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument states that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate. The argument does not address whether inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences or whether Riley's animosity toward the university president is well-founded.
A: The argument does not assume that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
B: The argument does not address whether inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences.
C: The argument may favor the university president's side if it is assumed that Riley has a long-standing feud with the president without any good reason.
D: This choice accurately describes the flaw in the argument. Riley's claim is rejected solely because of her past feud with the president, which suggests she may have a biased opinion; however, that does not invalidate her claim in this specific instance.
E: The argument does not address whether Riley's animosity toward the university president is well-founded.
Action: Answer("D")

  The argument is not discussing whether Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The argument is about the appropriateness of the university president's speech. Professor Riley argues that the speech was inappropriate because it was inflammatory. However, the argument is flawed if it makes assumptions, fails to address other possibilities, or draws false conclusions based on insufficient evidence.
A: The argument does take into consideration that if the president's speech was not inflammatory, it may not be inappropriate either. Hence, this is not the flaw in the argument.
B: The argument does not address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences, but this does not necessarily make the argument flawed.
C: The argument does not favor the university president's side. It weighs the evidence presented by Riley and suggests that if there are no other independent reasons to deem the speech inflammatory, then it is not necessarily inappropriate. Hence, this is not the flaw in the argument.
D: The argument does not conclude that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true. The argument states that the claim is deemed false unless there are independent reasons to support it. Hence, this is not the flaw in the argument.
E: The argument does not address whether Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded, but this does not necessarily make the argument flawed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period to estimate the number of people employed.
  In the first quarter of using the program, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  
Analysis: 
  Since some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions, and the new program which tallied the number of paychecks per pay period was used, it means that the new program overestimated the number of people employed in X. Hence, (D) is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The new program uses the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers as its estimate of employment.
  - Some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  - The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  
  A: The passage provides no information to suggest that the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program.
  B: The passage provides no information about what the designers of the new program were aware of.
  C: The passage provides no information about the government's report on employment growth in the quarters before the new program was used.
  D: The passage suggests that the government overestimated the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used because some employers issued multiple paychecks per pay period.
  E: The passage provides no information to support the claim that there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - The new program tallied number of paychecks per period issued by employers to estimate employment in Country X.
  - There was a large increase in number of people employed in the first quarter of using the program.
  - Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  
  A: There is no evidence from the passage to suggest that the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before. Therefore, A cannot be properly concluded.
  B: There is no evidence from the passage to suggest that the people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period. Therefore, B cannot be properly concluded.
  C: There is no evidence from the passage to suggest one way or the other whether strong growth in the number of people employed had been reported by the government for the quarters just before the new program was used. Therefore, C cannot be properly concluded.
  D: Since some employers in X issued separate paychecks for overtime, bonuses, and commissions, the number of checks would overestimate the total number of people employed in X. Therefore, D can be properly concluded.
  E: There is no evidence from the passage to suggest that there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used. Therefore, E cannot be properly concluded.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
A: There is no information provided that allows us to conclude that the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before. We cannot compare the accuracy of the old and new methods as the old method is not stated.
B: There is no information provided that allows us to conclude that the people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
C: There is no information provided that allows us to conclude whether or not the government had reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
D: The government's report was based on the number of paychecks issued by employers. Since some employers issued multiple paychecks for one employee, the total number of people employed could have been overestimated, but we cannot conclude that it was overestimated.
E: There is no information provided that allows us to conclude that there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. This program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and used that figure as its estimate of employment. In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
A: There is no basis in the passage to conclude that the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before. There is no information about the accuracy of the government's estimate of employment before and after the new program was employed.
B: There is no basis in the passage to conclude that the people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period. 
C: There is no basis in the passage to conclude that the government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used. 
D: The passage indicates that the new program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and used that figure as its estimate of employment. If some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions then the program's count of the number of people employed would be overstated. Therefore, it can be concluded that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. 
E: There is no basis in the passage to conclude that there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The new computer program used by the government of Country X to determine the number of people employed tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
A: The passage provides no information that can help us conclude that the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after it began using the new program than it had been before. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
B: The information in the passage does not provide any evidence about the awareness or lack of awareness of the people who designed the new program. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
C: The passage provides no information about the number of people employed in the quarters just before the new program was used. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
D: Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. Therefore, the government's use of the total number of paychecks as the basis of the estimate would have resulted in an overestimate of the total number of people employed in X. Hence, the correct answer is D.
E: Although the new computer program might have overestimated the total number of employed people in X, there is nothing in the passage to suggest that the government's claim of strong growth in the number of people employed in X was false. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The new computer program used by the government of Country X simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
A: The passage does not provide any information that would support or imply that the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
B: The passage does not provide any information that would support or imply that the people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
C: The passage does not provide any information that would support or imply that the government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
D: The fact that some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions implies that the government's estimate based on the number of paychecks per pay period would have included extra paychecks that do not indicate additional employees. Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
E: The passage does not provide any information that would support or imply that there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X tallied the number of paychecks issued to estimate employment.
  The program did not distinguish between separate types of paychecks.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  In that first quarter, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours worked, overtime, and bonuses/commissions.
  
  A: There is no evidence to support this conclusion. We cannot know the accuracy of the previous method.
  B: The passage notes that the new program simply tallied the number of paychecks issued, so the designers of the program may not have considered different types of paychecks. However, we cannot conclude this from the fact that some employees received different types of paychecks.
  C: The passage does not provide any information regarding the government's reports of employment in quarters prior to the first quarter this program was used. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about government reports before the new program.
  D: Since some employers issued separate paychecks for work, overtime, and bonuses/commissions, the total number of paychecks issued in this period may have been inflated. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: We cannot conclude this statement from the information given, because there may have been actual growth in the number of people employed in X, even if that growth was overestimated by the new program.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers.
- The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in X for the first quarter the program was used.
- In the first quarter the program was used, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.

Analysis:
- If some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions, then the number of paychecks could be higher than the number of people employed.
- Since the government used the number of paychecks to estimate the employment, the government likely overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program in 1988 to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in Country X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. 
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The new computer program simply tallies the number of paychecks issued by employers to estimate employment numbers. However, in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers issued multiple paychecks to their employees. Therefore, it is highly likely that the program overestimated the number of people employed for the first quarter.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument states that the Wilson Appliance Company's product accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago and now it accounts for only 25 percent of such sales. The average net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
A: This choice correctly identifies that the argument mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product.  
B: Although the argument does not provide any specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them, this is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument.   
C: The argument is about the sales of hair dryers produced by Wilson Appliance and does not need to discuss sales figures for other products.   
D: This choice discusses a possibility that is not addressed in the argument. Thus, this is not a flaw in the reasoning of the argument.  
E: The argument provides no information about the relative profitability of Wilson Appliance's various products. Thus, this is not a flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument states that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has led to a decline in its net income from sales of the product, but it assumes that there has been no increase in competition or other market factors that could have affected the company's net income. It also assumes that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer was its most profitable product and that the company has not introduced any new products over the past five years that could have affected its overall sales and profits.
A: The argument does mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product, which could have remained constant or even increased while the company's overall market share declined.
B: The argument provides information about the average net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold, which is the relevant information for this argument rather than the overall profits generated by hair dryers.
C: The argument focuses specifically on the sales figures for Wilson Appliance's hair dryers and provides no information about the company's other products, so this is not a flaw in the argument.
D: The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the past five years, so an increase in retail price would not affect the company's net income from sales of the product.
E: The argument does not provide any information about the profitability of Wilson Appliance's other products, so this is not a flaw in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument relates to an inference drawn on the net income of Wilson Appliance Company and the reason for the decline in net income.
A: The argument does not mistake a decline in market share of Wilson's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. It just compares the current market share of Wilson's hair dryer with that of five years ago
B: The argument does not require specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for companies that produce them. It is concerned with Wilson Appliance Company's net income from sales of their product.
C: Sales figures for Wilson Appliance Company's products other than hair dryers are irrelevant to the argument which is concerned with only the sales of hair dryers.
D: The argument states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Therefore, it is unlikely that the retail price of the hair dryer increased over the past 5 years.
E: The argument provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products, but it is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% of all hair dryer sales nationwide.
  The argument states that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed in the past 5 years.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from hair dryer sales must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.

Action: Answer("A")  
The argument is flawed because it confuses the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers with a decline in total sales of the product. There could be an overall increase in hair dryer sales, but Wilson Appliance's share of the market has decreased. Therefore, the conclusion that the company's net income from hair dryer sales must be only half of what it was 5 years ago is not necessarily true.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has decreased from 50% to 25%, and because the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: This choice correctly identifies that the argument assumes that a decline in market share equates to a decline in total sales. However, this may not be true as the market may have simply grown over the last five years, leading to the decline in market share. Thus, this choice is the correct answer.
  B: The argument doesn't need to provide specific information about the profits generated by hair dryers.
  C: The argument only discusses one product, namely its hair dryer, so there is no need to address other products.
  D: Although an increase in price might be a factor, it cannot independently offset a 50 percent decrease in market share.
  E: The argument does not discuss the relative profitability of Wilson Appliance's products; thus, this answer choice is irrelevant.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument mentions that the market share of the Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer declined from 50% to 25% over the last five years.
  The argument also states that the net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last five years and that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: The argument correctly mentions that the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has declined from 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide to 25 percent of such sales. Therefore, A is not the correct answer. 
B: The argument does not discuss the profits generated by companies that produce hair dryers but focuses solely on the Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer. Therefore, B is not the correct answer.
C: The argument only focused on Wilson Appliance's hair dryers and did not mention other products by the company. Therefore, C is not the correct answer.
D: The argument fails to acknowledge the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which could have offset any loss in market share. Therefore, D is the correct answer.
E: The argument does not mention whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is the least profitable product, so it is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument. Therefore, E is not the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales five years ago. 
  It also states that the current share of sales for hair dryer is 25%, but the average net income hasn't changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.

A: This choice correctly identifies the flaw in the argument, as it confuses the market share of the product with the total sales of the product. Just because Wilson Appliance's hair dryer accounts for 25% of the overall market today doesn't mean the total sales of hair dryer have declined.
B: The argument doesn't discuss profits generated by the hair dryer, so this choice isn't relevant to the reasoning in the argument.
C: This choice is incorrect because the argument is only discussing hair dryers, not other products.
D: While a price increase could potentially affect the net income calculation, the argument specifically states that the average net income has remained constant over the past 5 years.
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument, which doesn't discuss the relative profitability of other Wilson Appliance products.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument in the passage states that because the Wilson Appliance Company's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales, and the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.

A: The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product. The argument is specifically talking about the market share of Wilson's product. This is not the flaw in the argument.

B: The argument is not about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. This is outside the scope of the argument. 

C: The argument does not discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers. This is not the flaw in the argument.

D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years. This is a possible flaw in the argument.

E: The argument does not provide independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. This is not the flaw in the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales declined from 50% to 25% of the national market share, and that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Then, it concludes that the net income from the sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago. 
A: This is correct. The argument mistakenly assumes that the decline in market share is a decline in total sales, which leads to an incorrect conclusion about net income. 
B: The argument is not about the profits generated by hair dryers in general, but about the profits generated by Wilson Appliance's hair dryer. Therefore, this choice is not relevant. 
C: The argument focuses only on Wilson Appliance's hair dryer, so sales figures for other products are not relevant to the conclusion. Therefore, this choice is not relevant. 
D: The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, so it implies that the retail price has not increased. Therefore, this choice is not correct. 
E: The argument does not provide information about the profitability of Wilson Appliance's other products, so this choice is not relevant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that hair dryers produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50% of nationwide sales 5 years ago and only 25% currently. It also suggests that the average net income from each hair dryer sold remains the same. 
A: This choice correctly identifies that the argument mistakes a decline in Wilson Appliance Company's market share for a decline in the total sales of hair dryers. It assumes that the total sales have remained constant. 
B: The argument does not require specific information about the profits generated by hair dryers produced by other companies. 
C: Sales figures for other products are irrelevant since the argument only pertains to the hair dryer produced by Wilson Appliance Company.
D: The argument states that the average net income from each hair dryer sold has not changed, so even if the price increased, the net income per dryer is still the same. 
E: The argument does not provide any information regarding the profitability of Wilson Appliance Company's other products, so this is irrelevant.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The argument of the scientist is that the iguana species on the small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
- A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument of the scientist and does not weaken his argument.
- B: If the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas in several respects, it would suggest that they did not come from the Americas. Thus, this weakens the scientist's argument.
- C: The scientist mentions that the rafting of iguanas is uncommon but not impossible or unlikely, so this statement does not weaken the argument of the scientist.
- D: This statement suggests that the iguana species might have come from Australia and not from the Americas, which weakens the scientist's argument.
- E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument of the scientist and does not weaken his argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The scientist's argument is that the progenitors of the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
A: The origin of other animal species on the island is not necessarily relevant to the origin of the iguana species, and so it does not weaken the scientist's argument.
B: If genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, it could suggest that the iguana progenitors may have come from elsewhere and not necessarily from the Americas. Thus, it could weaken the scientist's argument. 
C: The lack of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument, because such cases might just be rare or have yet to be documented.
D: The presence of fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands in Australia does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument, because it could suggest that the iguanas initially came from Australia and not the Americas.
E: The fact that numerous plant and animal species in South America and Australia date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument, because it could suggest that the iguanas initially came from South America or from some other land mass that was part of Gondwana. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument made by the scientist is that the species of iguana found on a small group of islands closer to Australia rafts on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas several millions of years ago.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument made by the scientist. The scientist is only discussing the provenance of the iguanas, not the totality of animal species on the island.
  B: If the genetic analysis indicates that the iguanas found on the islands are different and not closely related to those found in the America, then this would weaken the scientist's theory that the iguanas on the islands come from the Americas.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument made by the scientist. The fact that cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon does not affect the scientist's theory.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument made by the scientist. Fossils found in Australia are beyond the scope of the argument.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument made by the scientist. The fact that lineages of other species found in Australia or South America date back to a period before the fragmentation of Gondwana does not affect the provenance of the iguanas on the islands.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The scientist claims that the iguanas on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, which included present-day South America and Australia. 
  A: Other animal species that inhabit the islands are not relevant to the argument about the iguanas' origins.
  B: Genetic differences between the iguanas on the islands and those in the Americas do not invalidate the possibility of rafting as a means of transport.
  C: The uncommonness of documented cases does not prove that it was impossible for the iguanas to have rafted from the Americas to the islands.
  D: The existence of fossils of closely related iguana species in Australia does not rule out the possibility that the island iguanas' progenitors came from the Americas.
  E: The fact that numerous plant and animal species in Australia or South America date back to the Gondwana period is not relevant to the argument about the iguanas' origins.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands was introduced to the islands by rafting from the Americas.
  A: This statement does not necessarily affect the scientist's argument.
  B: If genetic analysis shows that the iguana species are different, it would weaken the argument since it would show that the species on the island did not originate from the Americas.
  C: If rafting events are uncommon, it strengthens the argument that rafting could have been a one-time event that introduced the species to the islands.
  D: The presence of fossils in Australia does not necessarily disprove the argument since the fragmentation of Gondwana could have allowed the species to be present in both continents.
  E: This statement does not address the argument presented by the scientist.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the species of iguanas on the small group of islands near Australia came from the Americas by rafting on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean.
  A: Other animal species on the islands not being found in the Americas does not weaken the argument for the origins of the iguanas.
  B: If genetic analysis reveals that the iguanas on the islands are different from their relatives in the Americas, it would suggest that the iguanas on the islands did not come from the Americas. 
  C: The rarity of documented cases of rafts with iguanas does not weaken the scientist's argument that the iguanas in the small group of islands came from the Americas 
  D: If fossils of iguanas closely related to those that inhabit the islands were found in Australia, it would suggest that those iguanas came from Australia and not from the Americas. 
  E: The lineage of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or South America dating back to before the fragmentation of Gondwana does not weaken the argument that the iguanas on the small group of islands came from the Americas.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist's argument is that the species of iguana living in the small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia.
  A: This statement does not directly weaken the scientist's argument about the iguanas' origin.
  B: If the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, it could suggest that they might have come from a different origin than the Americas.
  C: This statement does not directly weaken the scientist's argument about the iguanas' origin.
  D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, it suggests that the progenitors of the species on the islands could be from Australia rather than the Americas.
  E: This statement does not directly weaken the scientist's argument about the iguanas' origin.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on small islands near Australia came from the Americas by rafting on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean.
  A: This statement is unrelated to the scientist's argument about how the iguana species came to inhabit the islands.
  B: If the genetic analysis showed that the iguana species on the islands were genetically distant from those found in the Americas, this would suggest that they did not raft over from the Americas, which would contradict the scientist's argument.
  C: The fact that documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon does not disprove the scientist's argument, which is that iguanas from the Americas rafted across the Pacific to these islands.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, which suggests that their progenitors may have come from Australia, not from the Americas, which contradicts the scientist's argument.
  E: This statement is unrelated to the scientist's argument about how the iguana species came to inhabit the islands.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species living in a small group of islands near Australia have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, as the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia.
  A: Animal species not found in the Americas weaken the argument that the iguana species rafted from the Americas on floating debris.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, but this doesn't necessarily weaken the argument that the iguana species rafted from the Americas on floating debris, especially if these genetic differences arose from subsequent evolution that occurred after the iguanas rafted.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses doesn't necessarily weaken the argument that the iguana species rafted from the Americas on floating debris, especially if it is possible for iguanas to raft.
  D: The presence of fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands that have been found in Australia doesn't necessarily weaken the argument that the iguana species rafted from the Americas on floating debris, unless it can be shown that these fossils are more closely related to the island iguanas than to mainland American iguanas.
  E: The fact that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana doesn't necessarily weaken the argument that the iguana species rafted from the Americas on floating debris. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that a plausible explanation for the presence of iguanas on the islands is that they rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: The presence of other animal species on the islands that are not found in the Americas does not weaken the scientist's argument for the iguanas.
  B: If the iguana species on the islands are found to be very different from those in the Americas, that could suggest that the iguanas on the islands may have arrived from some other source than the Americas.
  C: If there are few documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses, then it would suggest that the scientist's argument is less likely to explain the presence of iguanas on the islands.
  D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, then it would suggest that the iguanas on the islands may have arrived from Australia rather than the Americas.
  E: The lineage of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America dating back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana does not weaken the scientist's argument for the iguanas.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, contrary to the council members' belief that it would not decrease safety with the purchase of latest safety technology. The editorialist cites numerous studies conducted 30 years ago to support the argument.
 
A: The editorialist does make a general statement based on a limited number of particular instances, but this is not the flaw in the argument.
B: This could be a possible weakness in the argument, but it is not the most accurate description of the flaw in the argument.
C: The argument acknowledges that the city council members support the increase, but it does not address whether or not they are aware of the studies conducted 30 years ago.
D: This accurately describes the flaw in the argument. The editorialist argues that an increase in air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, citing studies from 30 years ago, but fails to acknowledge that there is no recent evidence to support the claim that the latest safety technology cannot mitigate the risks associated with increased air traffic. 
E: This possibility is not addressed in the argument and is not the flaw in the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond a certain capacity reduces safety, and using the latest safety technology cannot avoid the dangerous consequences.
  A: The argument is not based on a limited number of particular instances, but on numerous studies.
  B: The editorialist acknowledges the use of the latest safety technology but argues that it cannot avoid the dangerous consequences of increasing air traffic beyond a certain capacity.
  C: The argument does not make any claim about the knowledge the council members have about the studies conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument does not confuse an absence of evidence with the existence of evidence against the claim.
  E: The argument does not consider the possibility of other benefits that might outweigh the risks associated with increasing air traffic.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist claims that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety at the airport.
  The council members argue that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist claims that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.

Flaw: 
  The editorialist draws a conclusion based on studies conducted 30 years ago, which could be outdated and may not be relevant to the current technological advancements or safety procedures. Therefore, the argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is. Thus, the correct answer is B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic at an airport beyond its original design capacity decreases safety. The argument is based on studies conducted 30 years ago, and the argument emphasizes that even the latest safety technology would not prevent safety from being reduced.

A: The editorialist's argument is based on specific studies conducted 30 years ago, not on a general statement inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
B: The argument does not mention that the latest technology might affect whether an airport can allow more air traffic without reducing safety.
C: The argument does not consider whether the city council members are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago and that the editorialist uses to criticize the council's proposal.
D: The editorialist does not rely on an absence of evidence to claim that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity would decrease safety. Rather, the editorialist relies on specific studies from 30 years ago suggesting that safety decreases when traffic levels exceed the airport's original design capacity. 
E: The editorialist's argument does not consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety. The argument is based on studies conducted 30 years ago that showed that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.
A: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
B: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
C: This may be a possible flaw in the editorialist's argument, but it is not the most accurate description of the flaw.
D: This accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist concludes that the increase in air traffic would decrease safety based on studies conducted 30 years ago, but fails to consider any new evidence that may contradict those studies or any new safety technologies that may have been developed since then.
E: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The editorialist claims that increasing the amount of air traffic beyond an airport's design capacity decreases safety.
  Several council members argue that the latest safety technology would compensate for the increased air traffic.
  However, the editorialist claims that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago refute this argument.
  
A: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument presents specific evidence to support the conclusion.
B: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument does not suggest that the latest technology cannot compensate for the increased air traffic.
C: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument acknowledges that some council members support the increase despite evidence to the contrary.
D: This is the flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument fails to consider that the studies conducted 30 years ago do not necessarily prove that the latest safety technology cannot compensate for the increased air traffic. The editorialist assumes that the absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity is the same as evidence against this claim.
E: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument does not address whether a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The editorialist argues that allowing more air traffic at an airport beyond its original design capacity will decrease safety even if the airport has the latest safety technology. The argument is based on the premise that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced in every airport where traffic was increased beyond the original design capacity. 

A: This doesn't accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  The argument is not based on a general statement inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.

B: This describes a possible flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  The argument doesn't consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.

C: This doesn't accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  The argument doesn't address whether the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.

D: This describes a possible flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.

E: This doesn't accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  The argument doesn't address whether a slight increase in safety risks is acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The editorialist is arguing that safety at an airport would decrease if the amount of air traffic allowed exceeds the airport's original design capacity, despite the purchase of the latest safety technology. The editorialist further supports the argument by claiming that this has been proven by numerous studies conducted 30 years ago. 

A: This choice describes the editorialist's argument by suggesting that they have drawn a conclusion based on a small sample size.
B: This choice suggests that the increase in air traffic might be safe if the latest safety technology is used. However, this is not the argument made by the editorialist.
C: This choice suggests that the city council members are aware of the studies conducted 30 years ago. However, this does not address the flaws in the editorialist's argument.
D: This choice describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist draws a conclusion that exceeds the scope of the studies they reference. They claim the studies prove that safety was reduced at every airport where traffic exceeded capacity, but the studies only show that safety was reduced at "some" airports. 
E: This choice suggests that safety risks might be acceptable if other benefits are gained. However, this does not address the flaws in the editorialist's argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The editorialist is arguing that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety. The council members are arguing that the increase can be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology, which would not decrease safety.

A: The argument does draw a conclusion based on a limited number of studies from 30 years ago, but the flaw is not accurately described by this choice.
B: This choice suggests a counterargument rather than a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
C: The possibility that the city council members are aware of the studies does not address the flaw in the editorialist's argument.
D: The flaw in the editorialist's argument is that it confuses an absence of evidence with evidence against the claim. The editorialist is arguing that safety will necessarily be decreased without offering any evidence for that claim other than the fact that studies show this has occurred in the past.
E: This choice offers a counterargument rather than a flaw in the editorialist's argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("D")

The flaw in the argument is that it confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim. The argument assumes that just because safety studies conducted 30 years ago showed a decrease in safety when airports increased air traffic beyond their original capacity, this must be true for all airports regardless of the latest safety technology. However, the argument fails to consider the possibility that newer technology may have changed the safety outcome, and therefore, lacks evidence to support the claim that safety will decrease.

  E: The argument does not imply that the only emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that there are always situations where it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, and thus it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  A: The argument does not say that anger is always expressible; it only suggests that there are always situations where it is healthy to try to express it.
  B: The argument states that one can choose any visceral emotion, and therefore assuming that anger is visceral is not problematic for the conclusion.
  C: This statement does not follow from the argument, as the argument is focused on situations where it is healthy to express emotions rather than unhealthy ones.
  D: This statement does not follow from the argument since the argument does not state that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: This statement does not follow from the argument since it is false: an emotion can be unhealthy to express even if it is visceral.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The psychiatrist claims that there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion.
  A: The argument does not assume that anger is always expressible.
  B: The argument assumes that anger is a visceral emotion, which is necessary to support the conclusion.
  C: The argument does not assume that some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express. In fact, the psychiatrist argues that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion.

  A: The argument does not say that anger must always be expressible in all situations.
  B: The argument states that anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: The argument does not say anything about some emotions being unhealthy to express, but rather focuses on the situations where it is healthy to express them.
  D: The argument implies that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral, but it does not state that all emotions that are visceral are healthy to express.
  E: The argument does not say anything about an emotion being healthy to express only if it is visceral.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that for each visceral emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to express that emotion. The argument then applies this to the specific emotion of anger, concluding that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  A: This answer choice is too extreme as it states that anger is always expressible, which the argument does not claim. There may be situations where it is not possible or appropriate to express anger.
  B: This answer choice is the premise of the argument as it establishes that anger is a visceral emotion. 
  C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument as it does not address whether there are always situations in which it is healthy to express an emotion.
  D: This answer choice is too extreme as it claims that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral, which is not supported by the argument.
  E: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument as it does not address whether there are always situations in which it is healthy to express an emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try and express any visceral emotion, and anger is given as an example of a visceral emotion.
  A: The argument does not state that anger is always expressible, and this assumption is not necessary for the conclusion to follow logically.
  B: This assumption is supported by the argument, as the psychiatrist mentions anger as an example of a visceral emotion.
  C: This assumption contradicts the argument, stating that some emotions are unhealthy to express. If anything, the argument suggests the opposite, that all emotions are healthy to express in certain situations.
  D: This assumption is not supported by the argument, and it is also too extreme, as the argument only states that there are situations where it is healthy to express visceral emotions, not that all healthy emotions are visceral.
  E: This assumption is also too extreme and is not supported by the argument, which only refers to visceral emotions in relation to the situations where it is healthy to express them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The psychiatrist argues that for any visceral emotion, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion. The psychiatrist then concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.

A: The argument does not say that anger is always expressible. The statement is too strong.

B: The argument says that anger is a visceral emotion, which is used as a premise, not an assumption.

C: The argument does not state this assumption. It actually contradicts this assumption by stating that there are situations where it is healthy to express emotions.

D: The argument does not make this claim either. It is possible that there are emotions that are healthy to express that are not visceral.

E: This assumption is consistent with the argument since the premise of the argument is that any visceral emotion is healthy to express.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that any visceral emotion can be healthy to express in certain situations and specifically mentions anger.
  A: This is too extreme. The argument doesn't say that anger can always be expressed, just that there are situations in which it is healthy to express it.
  B: The argument provides support for this assumption by using anger as a specific example of a visceral emotion. 
  C: This goes against the argument's premise that any visceral emotion can be healthy to express in certain situations.
  D: This is too extreme. The argument doesn't say that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral, just that visceral emotions can be healthy to express in certain situations.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument states that statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. The argument concludes that adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.

A: This option suggests that although more accidents happen in roads with designated bicycle lanes, it is not properly indicated if serious injuries are more common on those roads. The argument only states that the number of accidents is higher, not necessarily the severity of the accidents.

B: This option suggests that more bicyclists usually opt for roads with bicycle lanes, which could explain why more accidents are reported on those roads. However, the argument is about whether adding designated bicycle lanes enhances safety and not about the number of accidents.

C: This option suggests that enhancing the safety of bicyclists does not always translate into enhanced safety for motorists. However, the argument does not discuss the safety of motorists but only the safety of bicyclists.

D: This option describes a conclusion that is the opposite of the argument's conclusion. The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists, while this option suggests that roads with bicycle lanes are safe.

E: This option suggests that statistics cannot be used to prove the argument's conclusion. However, the argument uses statistics to support its conclusion.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads does not enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions occur between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  A: This is not a criticism of the argument, the argument mainly claims that adding bicycle lanes to roads will not enhance safety of bicyclists. Even if injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes, the argument can still hold true.
  B: This is not a criticism of the argument, the argument is about the number of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles which occur on roads having bicycle lanes versus roads without such lanes.
  C: This is not a criticism of the argument, the argument is about the safety of bicyclists, not motorists.
  D: This is not a criticism of the argument, the argument clearly states that statistically, more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  E: This is a possible criticism of the argument because the argument uses statistical evidence to support the conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, but the evidence may not be sufficient to draw such a conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the statistics that suggest more collisions occur on roads having bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
A: This option raises the possibility that injuries to bicyclists on roads with designated bicycle lanes are as serious as those without such lanes. However, it doesn't directly attack the argument made in the passage. 
B: This option raises the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than without such lanes. However, it doesn't directly attack the argument made in the passage. 
C: This option criticizes the assumption that an alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists will enhance the safety of motorists. This is not directly relevant to the argument made in the passage.
D: This option is a direct attack on the argument made in the passage, which claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists. 
E: This option mischaracterizes the argument in the passage. The argument isn't saying that the statistical evidence proves the opposite conclusion. Rather, it's saying that the statistical evidence doesn't support the conclusion that adding more bicycle lanes will enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads with specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Thus it concludes that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  
A: This criticism is not relevant to the argument. Even if injuries sustained on roads with designated bicycle lanes are as serious as those on roads without such lanes, it does not affect the premise that more accidents occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  
B: This criticism may affect the argument because if there are more bicyclists on roads with bicycle lanes, it could account for more accidents, thus making the conclusion questionable.
  
C: This criticism is not relevant to the argument since it does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  
D: This is not a criticism of the argument but rather a misinterpretation of the argument's premise. The argument does not imply that only some roads with designated bicycle lanes are safe.
  
E: This is not a criticism since the argument is not based on statistical evidence that proves the opposite conclusion. Rather, it is based on statistical evidence that the argument believes contradicts a claim that adding bicycle lanes enhances safety.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the context claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists by comparing the number of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occurring on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes with roads not having such lanes. 
A: The argument does not address the seriousness of the injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes compared to those on roads without such lanes.
B: The argument does not consider the possibility of more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than those riding on roads without such lanes.
C: The argument assumes that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists but does not necessarily establish any relationship between the safety of bicyclists and motorists.
D: The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on collisions occurring on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes without considering the state of such roads, and the same conclusion cannot be generalized to all roads.
E: The argument does not use statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists, and therefore, cannot be considered evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument presented states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists. The premises to support this are: 1) statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having bicycle lanes than on roads without such lanes. 
A: This is a possible criticism, but it does not directly address the argument's premise or conclusion on whether adding bicycle lanes enhances the safety of bicyclists.
B: This could be a valid criticism as it may affect the frequency of collisions, but it does not directly address whether adding bicycle lanes enhances the safety of bicyclists.
C: This is a possible criticism, but the argument does not assume or take for granted that any alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
D: This is not a valid criticism as the argument does not conclude that only some roads that currently have bicycle lanes are safe.
E: This is the best criticism and the argument is vulnerable to it. The argument uses statistical evidence that shows more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes as evidence that adding bicycle lanes does not enhance the safety of bicyclists, which is the opposite conclusion. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that adding bike lanes to roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, even though statistics show more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  A: This is not a valid criticism because the argument does not make any claims about the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents.
  B: This is not a valid criticism because the argument is based on the number of collisions, not the number of bicyclists on the roads.
  C: This is a valid criticism because the argument assumes that any alteration made to enhance bicyclist safety also enhances motorist safety.
  D: This is not a valid criticism because the argument is not based on the safety of some roads but rather on the number of collisions on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  E: This is a valid criticism because the argument uses statistical evidence to support a conclusion that contradicts the same statistical evidence.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument presented states that designating bicycle lanes on roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, and the reason given is that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
A: This choice is not a criticism of the argument's reasoning and therefore is not the right answer.
B: This choice is not a criticism of the argument's reasoning and does not address the argument that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
C: This choice is not a criticism of the argument's reasoning and assumes that the safety of bicyclists and motorists are not correlated.
D: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning, suggesting that the argument may be based on a false premise that only some roads that currently have bicycle lanes are safe.
E: This choice is a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning, suggesting that the evidence provided may not be sufficient or relevant enough to support the given conclusion. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The argument claims that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the fact that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
A: This possible criticism is not particularly relevant to the argument presented, as the argument is focused on the number of collisions, not the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists.
B: This possible criticism is also not particularly relevant to the argument presented, as the argument is focused on the number of collisions, not the number of bicyclists.
C: This possible criticism is not mentioned or implied in the argument.
D: This possible criticism is not accurate, as the argument does not attempt to conclude that only some roads with bicycle lanes are safe.
E: This possible criticism is the most accurate, as the argument uses statistical evidence that is not conclusive to support the conclusion that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Therefore, the argument concludes that adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.

A: This choice presents a possible criticism that the injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes. However, this criticism does not address the argument that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
B: This choice presents a possible criticism that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes. However, this criticism does not address the argument that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
C: This choice presents a possible criticism that it takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists. However, this criticism is irrelevant to the argument that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.

  C: This statement does not provide a direct connection between bee vision and flower evolution, so it is not the best answer.
  D: This statement might suggest that bees are important to nonflowering plants, but it does not provide a direct connection between bee vision and flower evolution, so it is not the best answer.
  E: This statement suggests that bees rely on flowers as their primary source of food, which would support the statement that flowers evolved to be identified by bees.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The statement suggests that flower color is not the primary reason for the bees' ability to identify them, but rather that flowers developed in response to bees' visual perception.
  A: This statement talks about other insects that share the same visual perception of bees, but does not support or refute the statement above.
  B: This statement suggests that not all flowers rely on bees, but does not necessarily support or refute the statement above.
  C: This statement provides information about the number of different species of flowers and bees, but it does not support or refute the statement above.
  D: This statement talks about nonflowering plants that rely on bees, but does not support or refute the statement above.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The statement above claims that the bees' vision is not the cause but rather the result of flower color.
  A: Many insects other than bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This statement neither supports nor refutes the claim in the statement.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This statement neither supports nor refutes the claim in the statement.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This statement neither supports nor refutes the claim in the statement.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This statement neither supports nor refutes the claim in the statement.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This statement supports the claim in the statement above by suggesting that flowers have played a role in the evolution of bees' feeding behavior.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The statement above claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: This option provides information about other insects, but it does not support the claim that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  B: This option does not support the claim that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have because it only mentions that some flowers rely on insects other than bees; it does not provide information about whether those flowers have developed in response to the vision of those other insects or not.
  C: This option does not support the claim that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have because it only provides information about the number of species, not the relationship between bees' vision and flower development.
  D: This option also does not support the claim that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have because it only mentions that many nonflowering plants rely on bees; it does not provide information about flowers.
  E: If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, it suggests that the relationship between bees and flowers is a result of coevolution, in which both have developed in response to each other. This supports the statement above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The statement is trying to say is that flowers developed their colors to ensure that bees pollinate them, which implies that bees' vision was the driving force behind flower color development. 
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument made in the question.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument made in the question.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument made in the question.

  E: This statement is supporting the argument by stating that bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, reinforcing the notion that flowers developed to attract bees. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The statement is arguing that flowers developed in response to bees' vision, not vice versa.
  A: This choice presents information about other insects, but it does not support the argument that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  B: This choice does not provide evidence for the argument. The statement doesn't claim that bees are the only pollinators of flowers.
  C: This choice does not support the argument. The total number of species is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: This choice does not support the argument. The fact that nonflowering plants rely on bees does not add any relevant information.
  E: This choice opposes the argument. If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, it would suggest that bees developed in response to flowers, not vice versa.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The statement claims that it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color. 
  A: This option provides information about other insects and their color perception, but it does not support the claim that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  B: This option weakens the statement, because it suggests that not all flowers developed in response to bees. 
  C: This option is irrelevant to the statement that concerns the relationship between bees' vision and flower color development.
  D: This option provides information about the reliance of nonflowering plants on bees, but it is not relevant to the statement.
  E: This option suggests that bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, which supports the claim that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have rather than bees' vision developed in response to flower color.
  A: The fact that some insects do not depend on perceiving an object's color does not provide any support for the claim that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have rather than bees' vision developed in response to flower color.
  B: If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, then this might suggest that flower color did not specifically develop in response to bees' vision. However, it does not support the claim that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  C: The number of different species of flowers being greater than the number of different species of bees doesn't support the claim that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather, it could be an argument for the other-side that argues bees developed their vision to better identify a larger number of species of flowers.
  D: The fact that many nonflowering plants rely on bees does not provide support for the claim that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  E: If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, then this might suggest that flower color and the vision of bees coevolved. However, it does not support the claim that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have rather than bees' vision developed in response to flower color.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The statement says that it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument claims that a diet based on fish protein would be much healthier than one based on red meat, but if everyone adopted such a dietary pattern, the marine species on which it is based would become extinct. Therefore, the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.

A: This argument presents evidence supporting the use of vitamin E supplements to reduce one's risk of heart attack, but it argues that there is not enough evidence to show that vitamin E supplements are safe for everyone. Therefore, it should not be recommended that everyone take vitamin E supplements.

B: This argument discusses taxing tobacco and using the tax revenue for education. It argues that if taxes become too high, people may smoke less and the funding generated through tax revenue would be reduced. Therefore, these taxes might have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.

C: This argument claims that consumers are better off limiting purchases to what they truly need and saving or investing any remaining income. However, if everyone followed this spending pattern, it would throw the economy into a severe recession, making it impossible for most people to save or invest. Therefore, this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.

D: This argument claims that if legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. However, if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. Therefore, it is not surprising that they spend so much time campaigning.

E: This argument discusses the restriction of land development in wilderness areas. It argues that this would help preserve many of the species that inhabit these areas, but would also reduce the proliferation of other species that flourish in developed areas. Therefore, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument explains that a diet based solely on fish protein is much healthier than a diet based solely on red meat protein. But the adoption of this diet by everyone would lead to the extinction of most of the marine species on which this diet is based. As such, the universal adoption of this diet should not be recommended.
A: The argument presents a study that suggests taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces the risk of heart attack. However, it is not yet established if vitamin E is safe for all people. Hence, the recommendation to take a vitamin E supplement every day should not be made for everyone.
B: The argument states that governments can impose heavy taxes on tobacco and use the revenue to fund education. But if the taxes become too high, it might lead to a reduction in smoking and hence less funding for education. So other sources of revenue may need to be considered.
C: The argument argues that consumers are better off when limiting expenses and saving or investing income. Nonetheless, if everyone did this, the economy would be in a recession, making it difficult for people to save or invest. Therefore, this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
D: The argument suggests that legislators have to campaign to get reelected, which takes up a lot of time, leaving less time to carry out their primary duties. Nonetheless, it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning as that is what helps them get reelected.
E: The argument argues that restricting land development in wilderness areas can help preserve the species that inhabit these areas. On the other hand, it can lead to a proliferation of species such as deer in developed areas. Thus, it is not clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument provided talks about a situation where a healthier diet that relies on marine species leads to extinction of most of those species, making it impossible to recommend universal adoption of this diet.
  A: The argument talks about a recommendation that should not be made, and provides evidence that is not conclusively established to support the argument. There is no similar recommendation in this answer choice.
  B: The argument talks about a situation where heavy taxation of tobacco might lead to reduced funding generated for education, thus requiring other funding sources. There is no similar situation in this answer choice.
  C: The argument talks about a spending pattern that might lead to a severe recession, thus making it impossible for most people to save or invest. There is no similar spending pattern in the argument.
  D: The argument talks about a causal relationship, where spending less time campaigning leads to more time to do the job, but might also lead to difficulty getting reelected. There is no similar causal relationship in the argument.
  E: The argument talks about a situation where restricting land development might lead to preservation of species that inhabit wilderness areas, but might also result in reduced proliferation of other species. There is a similar situation in this answer choice, where adopting a healthier diet might lead to extinction of most marine species, and thus making it impossible to recommend it for universal adoption.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument presents a situation where a certain action (adopting a healthier diet) is desirable but would lead to an undesirable outcome (extinction of marine species). Therefore, the argument concludes that the action should not be recommended universally. 
A: The argument presents evidence that a certain action (taking vitamin E supplements) is beneficial but not safe for all people. Therefore, the argument concludes that the action should not be recommended universally.
B: The argument talks about how the high taxes on tobacco could lead to a reduction in the funding of education. Therefore, such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
C: The argument presents a situation where a certain spending pattern (limiting purchases to what one truly needs) is beneficial but would lead to an undesirable outcome (severe recession). Therefore, the argument concludes that the spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
D: The argument presents a situation where a certain action (spending less time campaigning) is desirable but would lead to an undesirable outcome (not getting reelected). Therefore, the argument concludes that it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
E: The argument presents a situation where a certain action (restricting land development in wilderness areas) is beneficial but would lead to an undesirable outcome (reducing the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas). Therefore, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a dilemma: adopting a healthy fish-based diet would lead to the extinction of many marine species, but not adopting it would be unhealthy. Therefore, the argument recommends that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  A: The argument presents a dilemma with respect to the safety of vitamin E supplements and recommends against recommending the universal adoption of taking them as a preventative measure.
  B: The argument presents a dilemma with respect to the government raising revenue for education through taxes on tobacco and recommends finding alternative sources of revenue.
  C: The argument presents a dilemma with respect to the benefits of saving and investing income and advises against recommending it universally due to the negative repercussions on the economy.
  D: The argument discusses the reasons why legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: The argument presents a dilemma with respect to designating areas as wilderness areas and preserving species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument presents a situation where adopting a healthier diet consisting of fish could have negative consequences on the species of marine life on which it is based and therefore recommends against the universal adoption of such a diet.
A: The argument discusses the implications of recommending a daily vitamin E supplement for all people without conclusive evidence of its safety for everyone. 
B: The argument discusses the effects of high tobacco taxes on education funding and the possible need for alternative sources of revenue. 
C: The argument discusses a spending pattern of limiting purchases to necessary items and saving or investing any remaining income and the potential negative effects on the economy if everyone were to do this. 
D: The argument discusses the relationship between legislators spending time campaigning and their chances of being reelected. 
E: The argument discusses the effects of restricting land development in wilderness areas on the species that inhabit these areas and the proliferation of species in developed areas. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a certain diet is healthier than another but universal adoption of it would result in the extinction of marine species on which it is based. Hence, the diet should not be recommended for universal adoption.
  A: The argument discusses the evidence that supports the claim that vitamin E reduces heart attack but it has not been conclusively established that it is safe. Therefore, vitamin E should not be recommended to everyone.
  B: The argument discusses the taxation of tobacco, high taxes could lead to people smoking less and funding generated for education could reduce. Therefore, other sources of revenue might need to be considered.
  C: The argument states that limiting purchases to what is needed and saving or investing the remaining income is better for a consumer. However, if everyone did so, it would likely cause a recession and make it impossible to save or invest. Therefore, this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
  D: The argument discusses the time spent on campaigning by legislators and how less time spent on it would help them do their jobs better. But if they spent less time campaigning, they might not get reelected. So, it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: The argument discusses how restricting land development in wilderness areas can preserve species but reduce the proliferation of the smaller number of species that flourish in developed areas. Therefore, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument states that a diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat but if everyone adopted such a diet, it would cause many marine species to become extinct, making it impossible to continue. Therefore, the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
A: The argument presents evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack, but it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. Hence, the author recommends not to recommend taking vitamin E supplements every day to everyone.
B: It discusses how governments can tax tobacco and spend the revenue on education, but high taxes might reduce funding generated for education if people smoke less. Thus, there might be a need to supplement tax revenue with other sources of funding.
C: The argument states that a consumer is better off by limiting purchases to what they truly need and saving or investing any remaining income. However, if everyone did this, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, making it impossible for most people to save and invest. Therefore, this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
D: It discusses how if legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not campaign as much, they probably would not get reelected. Hence it is not surprising that legislators spend a lot of time campaigning.
E: The argument states that restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many of the species that inhabit these areas. However, it also reduces the proliferation of other species, such as deer, in developed areas. Thus, deciding which areas should be designated as wilderness areas is not always clear.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The argument presents a situation where universal adoption of a healthier diet causes the extinction of marine species that the diet is based on making it impossible. Therefore, the universal adoption of such a diet is not recommended.
A: The argument presents a situation where taking vitamin E supplements is said to reduce the risk of heart attack. However, it has not been confirmed that vitamin E supplements are safe for everyone. Therefore, recommending the universal adoption of vitamin E supplements is not recommended.
B: The argument presents a situation where governments are allowed to tax tobacco heavily, which generates tax revenue that is used to fund education. However, excessive taxes might lead to a reduction in smoking, which in turn reduces the funding generated for education. Therefore, other sources of revenue might be needed to supplement these taxes.
C: The argument presents a situation where limiting purchases to what one truly needs and saving or investing the rest leads to a better outcome for an individual consumer. However, if everyone did this, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. Therefore, recommending this spending pattern to everyone is not recommended.
D: The argument presents a situation where if legislators spent less time campaigning and more time doing their jobs, they would have more time to do what they are elected to do. However, if they spend less time campaigning, they would probably not get reelected. Therefore, legislators spend a lot of time campaigning.
E: The argument presents a situation where restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve species that live in such areas. However, this reduces the proliferation of other species such as deer that flourish in developed areas. Therefore, it is not clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that a healthy diet whose protein comes from fish would result in the extinction of most of the marine species on which it is based if everyone were to adopt it, therefore, it should not be universally adopted.
  A: The argument presents a health benefit for taking a vitamin supplement, but it has not been conclusively established that it is safe for all people; therefore, its universal recommendation should not be made.
  B: The argument claims that governments can tax tobacco and use the revenue for education, but if the taxes become too high, people might smoke less reducing funding generated for education. Therefore, taxes might need to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: The argument claims that limiting purchases to what a consumer truly needs and saving would make a consumer better off. However, if everyone did this, it would lead to a severe recession making saving and investing impossible for most people. So, this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
  D: The argument claims that if legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do their jobs, but they would not get reelected if they did not campaign. Therefore, it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: The argument claims that restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas, but it also reduces the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. Therefore, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The employee argues that just as having decorations or windows can be distracting, blocking access to non-work-related websites will not necessarily lead to better work.
  A: The argument against moderation is based on individual variability and suggests that to speak of moderation is to ignore these differences.
  B: The argument is against a ban on a device because similar bans on objects with potentially harmful effects have not been proposed.
  C: The argument is that a company will need to replace retiring workers to maintain its current workforce.
  D: The argument is against the idea that engaging characters guarantee success in writing.
  E: The argument is against the use of profit relative to cost as a measure of a movie's success.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that the company's rationale for blocking non-work-related websites is flawed because it assumes that distracting things are always bad for productivity, which is not necessarily true.
  A: This argument questions the validity of the concept of moderation by arguing that it fails to account for individual differences in response to certain substances.
  B: This argument questions the validity of banning a particular electronic device based on the fact that many chemicals can cause cancer in high doses, yet are still allowed.
  C: This argument is based on the premise that Acme will need to replace retiring employees, and does not relate to the issue of productivity and distraction.
  D: This argument questions the idea that creating engaging characters is a sure path to publishing success, but does not relate to the issue of productivity and distraction.
  E: This argument questions the validity of using profit relative to cost as a measure of a film's success, but does not relate to the issue of productivity and distraction. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The employee argues that just as offices with windows and decorations can be distracting, the internet filtering software installed by the company is not a guarantee of better work. It is possible that the distraction caused by non-work-related websites may not be substantial or that access to such websites may actually boost morale (which will increase work productivity).
A: This argument challenges the very idea of moderation, suggesting that what counts as a moderate amount of something varies from person to person.
B: This argument challenges the validity of research that concludes the dangers of something, suggesting that chemical substances may not be carcinogenic in lower doses.
C: This argument is simply making a statement of fact; it does not offer any reasoning to support its conclusion.
D: This argument challenges the idea that engaging characters guarantee a sale, suggesting that other factors may come into play when manuscripts are being considered by publishers and agents.
E: This argument challenges the standard by which movie success is measured, suggesting that a more nuanced criterion should be used. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not the only source of distraction in the workplace, and that the company is not addressing other sources of distraction.
  A: The argument centers around the notion that moderation is not a concept that can be applied universally, because people's reactions to different substances vary. 
  B: The argument is that just because one thing causes a negative effect, doesn't mean all things that share that attribute should be banned.
  C: The argument is that Acme will need to hire new employees because their current employees are retiring.
  D: The argument is that publishers and agents do not guarantee publishing success, since they also reject manuscripts that focus too much on character development.
  E: The argument is that the movie industry's success criteria is flawed because it prioritizes cost over revenue.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The employee is arguing that blocking non-work-related websites is not a good way to increase productivity, since other distractions exist and it is not fair to assume that everyone is distracted by the same thing.
  A: This argument is about how moderation is not an easy concept to apply since people react differently to different things.
  B: This argument is about how not all things that cause harm in high doses should be banned completely.
  C: This argument is about how Acme will need to hire enough new employees to replace the ones that retire.
  D: This argument is about how having engaging characters in a novel does not guarantee that the novel will be successful.
  E: This argument is about how judging a film's success solely on its profit is not a good way to determine its quality.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The employee argues that website filtering software blocks non-work-related websites, but offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can also be distracting. Therefore, blocking websites is not a guaranteed way to eliminate distractions.
  A: This argument criticizes the idea of moderation because people have different biological differences, so what constitutes moderation for one person might be too much for another person.
  B: This argument criticizes a proposed ban on an electronic device because most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, but we don't ban them for that reason.
  C: This argument points out that because 1,000 of Acme's employees are retiring, Acme must hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year to keep a work force as large as its present one.
  D: This argument criticizes the idea that engaging characters guarantee a sale of a novel or story because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: This argument criticizes the movie industry's criterion for success that focuses on a film's profit relative to its cost because according to this criterion, an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is counterintuitive.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that blocking non-work-related websites is not a good way to improve productivity because other factors can also distract employees.
  A: The argument is about the claim that moderation is good for everyone, but the argument states that people's reactions to moderation may differ based on biological differences.
  B: The argument is about the claim that exposure to an electronic device causes cancer in laboratory animals, but the argument states that many chemicals cause cancer in large doses.
  C: The argument is about the claim that Acme needs to hire 1,000 people, but the argument states that Acme expects 1,000 people to retire and hence need to be replaced.
  D: The argument is about the claim that engaging characters guarantee a sale, but the argument states that publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: The argument is about the claim that profit relative to cost is a misguided way to judge success of a movie, because it does not account for budget differences.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The employee is arguing that website filtering software does not necessarily improve productivity, since there are many other distractions in the workplace, and some can actually improve motivation and energy. 
  A: This argument is about biological differences between individuals and how moderation can be a relative term, depending on the person.
  B: This argument is about the use of chemicals and the dangers of extrapolating findings from laboratory experiments to human beings.
  C: This argument is about the need for Acme to maintain its current workforce by hiring new employees as others retire.
  D: This argument is about the relative importance of character development in creative writing and its relationship to book sales.
  E: This argument is about the limitations of judging movie success based on its profit-to-cost ratio.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The employee is arguing that the company's rationale for blocking non-work-related websites is flawed because it assumes that distractions are inherently bad for work productivity. The employee is pointing out that there are other potential distractions besides websites and that there is no evidence that non-work-related websites are more distracting than other types of distractions. 
A: This argument is about individual differences in how substances affect people, rather than about the flaws in a particular reasoning.
B: This argument is about how banning an electronic device is not justified by the fact that most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses.
C: This argument is about the number of people that Acme will need to hire over the next year, which has nothing to do with the issue of website filtering.
D: This argument is about how engaging characters do not guarantee that a novel will sell, which is not related to the issue of website filtering.
E: This argument is about how a movie's success should be judged relative to its costs, rather than just its profits, which is not related to the issue of website filtering.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The employee is arguing that website filtering software may not necessarily increase productivity since other things in an office can be just as distracting, hence the software may not achieve its intended purpose.
A: This argument is about biological differences and how they affect people's reaction to different substances. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
B: This argument is about the dangers of electronic devices. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.
C: This argument is about the number of employees that a company will need to hire. It is not similar in reasoning to the employee's argument.

A: This statement implies that there is a limit to how much nicotine can be absorbed by the body. However, the study did not suggest that blood cannot absorb more nicotine than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
B: This statement would explain why smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes might have lower levels of nicotine in their blood than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes. However, the study found that smokers of both low- and high-nicotine cigarettes had identical levels of nicotine in their blood at the end of a day's worth of smoking.
C: This statement provides an explanation for the study's findings. If most of the nicotine is absorbed into the blood regardless of the quantity delivered, then smokers who smoke low-nicotine cigarettes will take in the same amount of nicotine as smokers who smoke high-nicotine cigarettes, but will simply smoke more cigarettes to compensate for the lower nicotine content.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the study's findings about the levels of nicotine in smokers' blood.

  A: This option provides information that suggests that the blood can only absorb a certain amount of nicotine, but it does not explain why the amount of nicotine in the blood is the same despite smoking cigarettes with different levels of nicotine.
  B: This option provides an alternative explanation to the claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, it does not directly explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking.
  C: This option provides an explanation to the finding of the nicotine study by suggesting that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. This option, therefore, is the best answer.
  D: This option provides information about the level of tar in cigarettes, but it does not explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking.
  E: This option provides information about what happens when taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued. It does not directly explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes that if grain prices double, then:
  - average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent
  - price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Choice A: Farmers reducing labor costs in the production and sale of beef is not relevant to the price increase of meat due to double in grain prices.
Choice B: The wholesale price difference between bread and beef is not relevant to the price increase of meat due to double in grain prices.
Choice C: The cost comparison between producing bread and beef is not relevant to the price increase of meat due to double in grain prices.
Choice D: The fact that only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain is not relevant to the price increase of meat due to double in grain prices.
Choice E: The fact that retail grocery outlets purchase bread from small independent bakers, but purchase meat from large wholesale processing operations, may contribute to the phenomenon described above as large-scale processing operations may be more affected by the increase in grain prices, leading to an increase in the price of beef.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that if grain prices double, the price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Choices:
  A: This fact doesn't explain why bread and beef react differently to doubling grain prices. It is irrelevant to the phenomenon described in the passage.
  B: If the wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread, then the higher cost of beef production and the lower cost of bread production might explain why the price of beef reacts more strongly to doubling grain prices than the price of bread. This is a possible explanation of the phenomenon.
  C: This choice provides information about the cost structure of bread and beef production, but it doesn't explain why bread and beef react differently to doubling grain prices. It is irrelevant to the phenomenon described in the passage.
  D: This fact suggests that the price of grass-fed beef might not be affected much by doubling grain prices, but it doesn't explain why bread and grain-fed beef react differently to doubling grain prices. It is irrelevant to the phenomenon described in the passage.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The researcher claims that lichens provide an accurate and cheaper way to monitor air quality.
- The researcher conducted an experiment to compare the accuracy of lichens with mechanical monitoring devices in copper-polluted areas.
Choices:
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the researcher's argument. The argument is about whether lichens are as accurate as mechanical monitoring devices.
  B: This statement supports the researcher's conclusion that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information because copper particles are present in the air pollution of several areas. 
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the researcher's argument. The argument is about whether lichens are as accurate as mechanical monitoring devices.
  D: This statement weakens the researcher's argument by suggesting that lichens can only be grown in laboratories, which would make it hard to use them as a replacement for mechanical monitoring devices in the field.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the researcher's argument about the accuracy of lichens in monitoring copper pollution. The argument is not about the potency of lichens in monitoring other pollutants.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The researcher argues that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information by comparing the accuracy of lichens with the best equipment available.
  A: Whether mechanical monitoring devices have already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem is not relevant to the argument of the researcher.
  B: Copper particles being a component of air pollution in several locales supports the researcher's argument that lichens can be used to monitor air quality in areas plagued by airborne copper pollution.
  C: Experiments showing that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal does not strengthen the researcher's argument that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  D: Whether lichens can easily be grown in laboratories is not relevant to the argument of the researcher.
  E: If lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper, it would strengthen the argument that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The researcher argues that lichens can be used to monitor air pollution effectively, and they are cheaper than existing mechanical devices.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the researcher's argument.
  B: This statement reinforces the validity of the researcher's experiment since copper pollution was the focus of the study.
  C: This statement undermines the validity of the researcher's experiment since the lichens may not have absorbed as much copper if surrounding air pollution was minimal.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the researcher's argument.
  E: This statement reinforces the validity of the researcher's experiment since it suggests that lichens can be used to monitor other pollutants as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The researcher has found lichens to be as accurate as the best equipment available in monitoring air pollution caused by copper.
Choices:
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. Whether mechanical monitoring devices have been installed or not is not related to the accuracy of lichen-based monitoring.
  B: If copper is a component of air pollution in several locales, then lichens can be used to monitor air pollution in those locales as well. This strengthens the argument as it shows that the use of lichens is not limited to only the researcher's specific location.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. Whether lichens thrive in areas with minimal pollution or not does not strengthen or weaken the argument that lichens can replace expensive monitoring devices.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. While it may be helpful to know that lichens can be easily grown in laboratories, it does not strengthen or weaken the argument that lichens can replace expensive monitoring devices.
  E: This statement is relevant to the argument as it suggests that lichens can be used to monitor other pollutants in addition to copper, making them even more useful and versatile in monitoring air pollution. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The researcher's argument is that inexpensive lichens can replace expensive mechanical monitoring devices without loss of information for accurate readings of air pollution. This is based on the researcher's own investigation that lichens have effectively measured the copper concentration at sites with airborne copper pollution. 
  A: This statement is not related to the argument presented by the researcher. 
  B: This statement supports the researcher's argument by stating that copper particles are present in several areas with air pollution. If lichens are effective at measuring copper concentration, this could be a more affordable and accessible alternative to mechanical monitoring devices which are expensive. 
  C: This statement is not related to the argument presented by the researcher. 
  D: This statement is not related to the argument presented by the researcher. 
  E: This statement weakens the researcher's argument by suggesting that lichens do not absorb all other significant air pollutants. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  The researcher tested the hypothesis by comparing the accuracy of copper concentration measurements acquired using lichens and mechanical monitoring devices.
A: This fact has no impact on the researcher's argument.
B: This suggests that the researcher's lichen-based approach can be used to measure other pollutants beyond copper, which could strengthen the researcher's argument.
C: This fact suggests that the presence of lichens is not necessarily an indicator of high air pollution levels, which could weaken the researcher's argument.
D: This fact has no bearing on the researcher's argument.
E: This fact would suggest that lichens are not a good replacement for mechanical monitoring devices since they fail to absorb other significant air pollutants.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The researcher's study found that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information. This conclusion was based on the comparison of lichens' copper concentration results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. 
A: This information is irrelevant to the researcher's argument.
B: This information is relevant and supports the researcher's argument that copper pollution can be monitored using lichens.
C: This information is not relevant to the researcher's argument. It argues the opposite: lichens thrive where air pollution is minimal, which would suggest that they might not be effective monitors in more polluted environments.
D: This information is not relevant to the researcher's argument. The study did not suggest that growing lichens in a laboratory would be useful.
E: This information is relevant and would add to the strength of the researcher's argument if it were true. It would suggest that lichens could effectively monitor other significant air pollutants as well as copper.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The researcher argues that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without information loss.
  The researcher reached this conclusion after comparing the accuracy of copper pollution concentration measurements obtained from lichens with those from mechanical monitoring devices.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. It talks about things that have not been done, not about the accuracy of lichens' measurements. 
  B: This statement provides support for the idea that lichens can be used to monitor air pollution because copper pollutants are not exclusive to one locale.
  C: This statement provides evidence that suggests lichens might not absorb pollutants in areas of high pollution levels, which weakens the argument. 
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument. It does not address lichens' ability to monitor air pollution nor does it address the accuracy of their measurements. 
  E: This statement strengthens the argument by implying that lichens can absorb pollutants other than copper with similar accuracy.

Response 8:
Knowledge: The researcher argues that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information, after conducting an investigation on the accuracy of lichens in detecting airborne copper pollution in comparison to mechanical monitoring devices.
A: This statement is not related to the argument and does not strengthen the researcher's claim.
B: This statement supports the argument by providing evidence that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several areas.
C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide evidence that lichens can replace mechanical monitoring devices.
D: This statement is irrelevant since the researcher is not suggesting growing lichens in laboratories, but rather using naturally grown lichens to monitor air pollution.
E: This statement weakens the argument, since if lichens absorbed other air pollutants differently from their absorption of copper, they would not be effective at replacing mechanical monitoring devices that measure multiple air pollutants.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute
  E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the ethical distinction between deceiving the listener by lying and withholding relevant information by offering an example to support it. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The journalist also makes the point that lying actively encourages a false belief, which is different from withholding information.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle that lying is unethical by comparing it to the case of withholding relevant information by journalists. The argument is that while withholding information may be intentional deception, it is not the same as lying because it does not actively encourage a false belief. Therefore, the journalist is comparing a case where the moral principle applies (lying) to one where it does not (withholding information). This matches choice E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending his/her position on the ethical distinction between withholding information and lying by offering an example. The example is that while withholding information and lying can both be seen as intentional deception, the difference between them is that lying actively encourages a false belief, while withholding information only fails to prevent one.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The journalist believes that there is a distinction between lying and withholding information, and argues that this distinction makes lying unethical but withholding information ethical. The journalist defends this distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of withholding information in the context of journalism. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending what he considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it. He argues that the distinction between lying and withholding information in interviews is significant, and asserts that lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief. The example he provides is that journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information, but this is not equivalent to lying.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the practice of withholding relevant information in interviews by offering an example to distinguish it from lying and demonstrating why it is not considered unethical. Therefore, the journalist is defending what they consider a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies (lying) to one in which it does not apply (withholding information in interviews). The journalist makes a distinction between lying, which actively encourages a false belief, and withholding information, which fails to prevent a false belief but does not actively encourage it. Therefore, the journalist is defending the distinction by offering an example of how it applies to the cases under discussion. Thus, the correct answer is E.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending what she considers a controversial distinction (withholding information vs. lying) by offering an example where the distinction is clear. The example is that lying is actively encouraging a false belief, while withholding information simply fails to prevent a false belief.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle (lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief) by comparing a case in which it applies (lying) to one in which it does not apply (withholding relevant information in interviews to elicit new information). This matches with choice E.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply. The journalist argues that there is a distinction between lying and withholding relevant information in interviews, and that this distinction is crucial for determining what counts as unethical behavior for journalists. They go on to argue that while withholding information might be deceptive, it does not actively encourage a false belief in the way that lying does, and so it is not necessarily unethical.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mario: I see that the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business. Evidently there's little demand for rugs in Glendale. So if you're planning to open a new business there, rugs would be one product to avoid. Renate: It's true that the store is gone, but its closing had little to do with the product it sold. All this means is that the
Question: The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: the rug store in Glendale sold rugs of inferior quality
  B: it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale
  C: it is possible to determine the market for rugs in Glendale
  D: any other stores have gone out of business in Glendale
  E: rug stores can close because of insufficient demand for rugs
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The dialogue is about the demand for rugs in Glendale, as evidenced by the closure of the only rug store in town. Mario suggests that, based on this evidence, rugs would be a product to avoid if you're planning to open a new business in Glendale. Renate, on the other hand, disagrees, and suggests that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold, implying that it might still be a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. 

Option A is not mentioned in the dialogue. Option C is mentioned, but it's not the main point of disagreement between the speakers. Option D is not mentioned in the dialogue at all. Option E is related to the main point of disagreement, but its wording is broader than that of option B, which more accurately reflects the main point of disagreement.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
  Mario believes that the rug store in Glendale went out of business because there is little demand for rugs in that area.
  Renate contends that the rug store's closing had little to do with the product it sold.

Reasoning:
  The conversation is about the rug store in Glendale and whether it would be a good idea to open a new business selling rugs there. Mario thinks that rugs may not be a good product to sell in Glendale because the rug store went out of business. Renate disagrees, saying that the rug store's closing was not related to the product it sold. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge: 
  Mario thinks that since the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business, it indicates there is little demand for rugs in Glendale and thus, it would be a bad idea to open a rug store there.
  Renate thinks that the closing of the rug store does not necessarily mean that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale.
  
Reasoning: 
  The conversation between Mario and Renate is centered on whether it's a good idea to open a new business (specifically a rug store) in Glendale. While they might have different reasons for thinking so, the conversation is not about the quality of rugs sold by the now-closed rug store, whether it is possible to determine the market for rugs in Glendale, whether any other stores have gone out of business in Glendale, or whether rug stores can close because of insufficient demand for rugs. 
  Both Mario and Renate agree that the rug store has gone out of business, but they disagree about whether it's a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge: 
  Mario states that the little demand for rugs caused the only rug store in Glendale to go out of business and therefore advises to avoid selling rugs. 
  Renate disagrees with Mario's advice and states that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold. 

Analysis: 
  The disagreement between Mario and Renate centers around whether it's a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale, given the recent closing of the only rug store there. While Mario advises against it, Renate disagrees and suggests that demand for rugs might not have been the reason that the store went out of business. 
  
Therefore, the best answer is B: it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Mario suggests that because the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business, there may be little demand for rugs in the area, and therefore, opening a new rug store may not be a good idea. Renate disagrees and points out that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, they are discussing whether or not opening a rug store in Glendale is a good idea, providing the most support for the claim that they disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. None of the other options are directly addressed in the dialogue.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Mario suggests that opening a rug store in Glendale would be a bad idea because there's little demand for rugs, but Renate disagrees and implies that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold. Based on this disagreement, the best choice is B, which accurately summarizes the dispute.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Mario assumes that the rug store went out of business due to a lack of demand for rugs in Glendale, and therefore suggests that opening a new rug store in Glendale is not a good idea. Renate, on the other hand, disagrees with Mario and claims that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold, implying that opening a new rug store in Glendale could still be a good idea. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Choice B is the correct answer.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
The dialogue between Mario and Renate centers around the discussion of a closed rug store in Glendale, and whether opening a new business that sells rugs in Glendale is a good idea.
A: The dialogue does not provide any information about the quality of the rugs sold at the rug store.
B: Mario suggests that because the only rug store in Glendale went out of business, it would not be a good idea to open a new business that sells rugs in Glendale. Renate disagrees with Mario, suggesting that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold and, therefore, a new business that sells rugs in Glendale could still be successful.
C: The dialogue provides limited information about the market for rugs in Glendale, but this is not the main point of disagreement between Mario and Renate.
D: The dialogue provides no information about any other stores that have gone out of business in Glendale.
E: Renate suggests that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the demand for rugs, indicating that rug stores can close despite there being demand for rugs. However, Mario and Renate are not disagreeing on this point. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Mario suggests that the rug store didn't do well because of low demand for rugs in Glendale and advises Renate that opening a rug store there is not a good idea. Renate disagrees with Mario and challenges his conclusion by stating that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold. The dialogue implies that they disagree over whether it's a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Therefore, B is the best answer. None of the other choices are directly related to the content of the dialogue.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Mario suggests that since the only rug store in Glendale went out of business, it would be a bad idea to open a new business there. Renate disagrees and points out that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold. The conversation is centered around the idea of opening a rug store in Glendale and whether or not it is a good idea. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. 
Thus, the correct answer is B.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument claims that H. pylori should not be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response and only a small percentage of people with H. pylori get stomach ulcers. The author compares this to Mycobacter tuberculosis, which also only causes illness in a small percentage of people, but is not considered a commensal. 

A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning and does not affect whether the claims about H. pylori are misguided or not.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning and does not affect whether the claims about H. pylori are misguided or not.
C: This statement challenges the argument's claim that people who harbor M. tuberculosis do not derive any benefit from its presence. If it is true that the presence of M. tuberculosis strengthens the immune system, then it could be considered a commensal by the same reasoning as H. pylori. This is the best answer.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning and does not affect whether the claims about H. pylori are misguided or not.
E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning and does not affect whether the claims about H. pylori are misguided or not.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that just because H pylori is a bacterium found in the human body and only causes stomach ulcers in a small percentage of people, it cannot be considered a commensal. The argument uses the example of M tuberculosis to support this claim. However, the question is asking which of the following choices would undermine this argument's reasoning.
  A: This statement does not relate to the argument's reasoning about whether H pylori can be considered a commensal or not.
  B: This statement also does not relate to the argument's claim.
  C: This choice undermines the argument's reasoning, as the argument assumes that a bacterium must have a benefit for the host in order to be considered a commensal, but this choice suggests that not all bacteria that benefit the host are considered commensals.
  D: This choice does not address the argument's reasoning and is irrelevant.
  E: This choice does not address the argument's reasoning and is irrelevant.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is trying to argue against considering Helicobacter pylori as a commensal bacterium, despite the fact that it only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of the people who harbor it.
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis and has a low rate of causing illness in people who harbor it.
  
A: This statement doesn't provide any information that would undermine the argument's reasoning.
B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: This statement strengthens the argument's reasoning, as it points out that individuals who harbor Mycobacterium tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, whereas some scientists believe that H pylori strengthens the immune response and, therefore, provides a benefit to its host.
D: This statement doesn't provide any information that would undermine the argument's reasoning.
E: This statement strengthens the argument's reasoning because it suggests that the majority of people who harbor bacteria in their bodies are likely to have H pylori, which has a lower rate of causing illness, rather than M tuberculosis, which has a higher rate of causing illness.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that considering H pylori as a commensal because only a small percentage of people with H pylori experience stomach ulcers is misguided, and this is compared to M tuberculosis which is not considered as a commensal even though only a small percentage of people with M. tuberculosis become sick from it.
  A: This statement does not affect the reasoning of the argument.
  B: This statement does not affect the reasoning of the argument.
  C: This statement weakens the argument because it provides an example of a bacterium that people do not consider to be a commensal even though only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick from it.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis that causes tuberculosis is not considered a commensal even though only a small percentage of people who harbor the bacterium get sick from it.
  A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument and does not affect the reasoning of the argument.
  B: This choice is also irrelevant to the argument and does not affect the reasoning of the argument.
  C: This choice suggests that M tuberculosis does not provide any benefit to the people who harbor it, which supports the reasoning of the argument.
  D: This choice is irrelevant to the argument and does not affect the reasoning of the argument.
  E: This choice suggests that more people harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, which weakens the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that Helicobacter pylori cannot be considered a commensal bacterium, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response, because it causes stomach ulcers in some individuals, despite the fact that Mycobacter tuberculosis is not considered a commensal either, but a significant number of people who harbor it do not develop tuberculosis.
  A: This information is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This information is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning by stating that those who harbor M tuberculosis do not derive any benefit from its presence.
  D: This information is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. 
  E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning since it suggests that H pylori, despite causing stomach ulcers in some individuals, is still able to be considered a commensal as it is more common in the population compared to Mycobacter tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument claims that Helicobacter pylori is not a commensal despite its alleged benefits because only 10% of its carriers develop stomach ulcers while the same percentage of people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis develop the disease. The argument implies that M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal either. 
A: This statement mentions the treatments for both diseases, but it does not address the argument's reasoning.
B: This statement compares the duration of the two diseases but it does not affect the argument's reasoning.
C: If it can be shown that Mycobacter tuberculosis benefits its human hosts, this would undermine the argument's reasoning that it is not a commensal. 
D: This statement mentions the number of people who harbor each bacterium, but it does not affect the argument's reasoning.
E: This statement mentions the number of people who harbor each bacterium, but it does not affect the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The argument is about whether H pylori is a commensal or not.
- The argument states that only less than 10 percent of the people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it, yet it is not considered a commensal.
- The argument implies that H pylori should also not be considered a commensal despite it allegedly strengthening immune response.

Action: Answer("C")
Explanation: 
If people who harbor M tuberculosis derive benefits from its presence, it could be argued that it should be considered a commensal. Choice C most directly challenges the argument that H pylori should not be considered a commensal simply because it causes negative effects in some people. Therefore, C undermines the argument's reasoning.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that considering H pylori as a commensal is misguided because it has been shown to cause stomach ulcers in less than 10% of people who harbor it. The argument then compares it to M tuberculosis, which also causes disease in less than 10% of people who harbor it, but is not considered a commensal. The argument suggests that there must be some other reason why H pylori is being considered a commensal.
  
  A: This statement does not affect the argument's reasoning and is not relevant to the discussion.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement potentially supports the argument's position that M tuberculosis is not a commensal. However, it does not directly undermine the reasoning for why H pylori is being considered a commensal.
  D: The number of people who harbor either bacterium is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement directly undermines the argument's reasoning. If there are more people who harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, then it would make sense to consider H pylori a commensal, even if it does cause stomach ulcers in some people. This statement suggests that the prevalence of H pylori in the population is much higher than that of M tuberculosis, which weakens the argument's claim that considering H pylori a commensal is misguided.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The argument is based on the fact that although both H. pylori and M. tuberculosis can cause disease, only H. pylori is sometimes considered a commensal. The author is arguing that this characterization is misguided because only a small percentage of people who harbor M. tuberculosis become sick from it, yet no one considers it a commensal. 
A: This statement provides information about treatment options but does not address the argument's reasoning. Eliminate. 
B: This statement may be true but it does not address the argument's reasoning. Eliminate.
C: This statement directly contradicts the argument. The author is arguing that M. tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because people derive no benefit from its presence. This statement directly contradicts that assumption. 
D: The number of people who harbor each bacterium is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. Eliminate.
E: The number of people who harbor each bacterium is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. Eliminate.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that polar bears can navigate over long distances and it supports this claim with an example of a bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: This statement undermines the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances as the bear stopped several times and changed its course, suggesting that the bear was not following a predetermined route.
  B: This statement does not challenge the validity of the evidence offered by the naturalists as it confirms that the site of the bear's release was on the bear's annual migration route, which could have aided the bear in finding its way home.
  C: This statement does not challenge the evidence presented by the naturalists as it describes the nature of the terrain the bear had to navigate but does not address the bear's ability to find its way home.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the naturalists' claim and does not challenge the evidence presented.
  E: This statement supports the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over long distances as it highlights the bear's ability to rely on its sense of smell to locate familiar territory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The naturalists are claiming that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances as they can find their way back home after being released 500 km away.
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory. This suggests that the polar bear might not have been relying on its navigational skills, but rather following its instincts or random movements.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This fact does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. This fact does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances. This fact does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. This does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the polar bears can navigate long distances. The evidence cited is the case of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away. 
  A: This statement doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence. The polar bear may have stopped and changed course to avoid dangerous obstacles or to hunt.
  B: This could support the validity of the evidence, since the polar bear would be likely to travel along its migration route to return home.
  C: This statement doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence. The polar bear may have traveled primarily on snow and ice because that is the terrain available.
  D: This statement doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence. The fact that other species can navigate long distances doesn't mean that polar bears cannot.
  E: This statement doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence. The fact that polar bears use their sense of smell to navigate doesn't mean that they cannot navigate using other senses or methods.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The naturalists claim that polar bears have the ability to navigate over considerable distances and cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: The fact that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times is not sufficient to cast doubt on the validity of the evidence. 
  B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear’s annual migration route, it could explain why the bear was able to find its way home and hence would not cast doubt on the validity of the naturalists' claim.
  C: The fact that the route the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice is not sufficient to cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  D: The fact that other species of mammals have been known to find their way home from considerable distances does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that some naturalists support that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances by citing evidence.
  A: This fact does not impact the evidence offered by the naturalists; it only suggests that the bear might not have traveled along a straight line.
  B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it could suggest that the bear was simply continuing its migration rather than navigating specifically back to its home territory.
  C: The fact that the route consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice does not impact the evidence offered by the naturalists.
  D: This fact is irrelevant to the evidence offered by the naturalists.
  E: The fact that polar bears rely on their sense of smell to find familiar territory does not discredit the idea that they can navigate over considerable distances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The question asks which option, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. 
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times on its way back home. This could imply that the bear was not using a specific navigation method or that it was not familiar with the territory.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This could support the naturalists' claim since the bear could have recognized its location and navigated back home based on its memory.
  Option C provides information about the terrain the bear traveled through, but it does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option D suggests that other animals also have been known to find their way home. This does not directly cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, but it could imply that other methods may have been used.
  Option E provides information about how polar bears navigate, but it does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  Evidence in support of this claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: This option describes an inconsistency in the route taken by the polar bear, but it does not necessarily refute the claim being made.
  B: This option provides an alternative explanation for why the polar bear was able to return home, which might cast doubt on the validity of the claim.
  C: This option provides information about the terrain but it does not necessarily refute the claim being made.
  D: This option suggests that the ability to navigate over considerable distances is not unique to polar bears, but it does not necessarily refute the claim being made.
  E: This option provides additional information about polar bears' navigation abilities, but it does not necessarily refute the claim being made.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The question is asking to find an answer that casts doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. The claim is based on the evidence that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over a considerable distance.
  A: If the polar bear had to stop and change course several times, it might indicate that the bear was not navigating over considerable distances.
  B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it might indicate that the bear was familiar with the area and was able to use its sensory perception to navigate through the area.
  C: If the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, it might indicate that the bear was using its sensory perception to navigate through the area.
  D: If polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, it might indicate that the ability to navigate over considerable distances is not unique to polar bears.
  E: If polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, it might indicate that the bear was using its sensory perception to navigate through the area.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances and cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  
A: This option doesn't cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, as it may suggest that the polar bear had to reorient itself and adjust its course as it encountered unfamiliar terrain. 
B: This option makes the naturalists' claim more plausible, as it suggests that the polar bear was released on its usual migration route.
C: This option doesn't cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, as polar bears are known to be able to navigate on ice and snow.
D: This option doesn't cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, as it describes a general ability of species members to find their way from considerable distances, but not specifically polar bears.
E: This option doesn't cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, as it describes one of the sensory mechanisms that polar bears use to navigate.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument presents a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer, and concludes that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer. However, the argument does not consider other factors that could also contribute to colon cancer.
A: The argument does not directly address the trend in fther consumption in many countries, so this choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
B: The argument mentions studies that demonstrate the negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer, but it does not discuss the risk of other types of cancer or the effects of high-fiber diets on those types of cancer.
C: The argument does not address the difficulty of including fther in people's diets, so this choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
D: The argument does not distinguish between the fther in different foods or discuss the cancer-fighting properties of the fther itself, so this choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
E: This choice presents a possibility that the argument overlooks. The argument asserts that fther-rich foods prevent colon cancer, but it does not address the possibility that other substances in those foods could also contribute to preventing colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer; higher consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer, and lower consumption of fiber causes colon cancer.
  A: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning or strengthen its conclusion. It provides no information relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement does not counter the argument's reasoning - it supports the studies cited in the argument.
  C: This statement might weaken the argument by suggesting that high fiber diets are not always achievable in practice. However, it is not a strong criticism of the argument's reasoning, which focuses on the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  D: This statement is a potential criticism of the argument's reasoning. If the fther in fruits and vegetables does more to prevent colon cancer than the fther in cereals, then the argument's claim that high-fiber foods generally prevent colon cancer would be weakened.
  E: This statement supports the argument's reasoning. If foods containing fther also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer, then eating high-fiber foods could be even more effective in preventing colon cancer than the argument suggests.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer exits.
  The colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables.
  In Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  Choice A is incorrect because the argument does not provide any evidence about the trend of fiber consumption in many countries.
  Choice B is incorrect. Although the argument suggests a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer, it does not mention anything about the risks of other types of cancer.
  Choice C is incorrect because the argument does not mention the difficulty of including fiber in people's diets.
  Choice D is a possible criticism because the argument assumes that all types of fiber have the same cancer preventive properties, while the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals may have different cancer-fighting properties.
  Choice E is incorrect because the argument is only discussing the relationship between fiber and colon cancer, not other substances that may prevent colon cancer.
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument is that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it by showing the relationship between colon cancer rates and the consumption of fther-rich foods in Western and non-Western countries and in Scandinavia. 

A: The argument doesn't mention anything about the consumption of fther in many countries rising appreciably, so it is not relevant to the argument. 
B: The argument doesn't discuss the risk of many types of cancer, so it is not relevant to the argument. 
C: The argument doesn't discuss the difficulty of including fther in people's diets, so it is not relevant to the argument. 
D: This answer choice is close to being a tempting answer, but the argument is not discussing whether the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have different cancer-fighting properties. The argument is about how areas with lower consumption of cereals tend to have higher colon cancer rates. 
E: This answer choice suggests that other substances in fther-containing foods may also prevent colon cancer, which is not discussed in the argument. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument is that colon cancer is caused by insufficient consumption of fiber and that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. The argument supports this reasoning by stating that the colon cancer rate is higher in countries that consume less fiber-rich foods. 
A: This possibility is irrelevant to the argument because the argument does not address trends in the consumption of fiber in many countries.
B: This possibility is also irrelevant to the argument because the argument only discusses the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer rate.
C: This possibility is also irrelevant since the argument is concerned with the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer and does not discuss the difficulty of including fiber in diets.
D: This possibility is also irrelevant to the argument because the argument does not compare the cancer-fighting properties of fiber in fruits and vegetables and in cereals.
E: This choice presents a relevant possibility that the argument overlooks which is that foods containing fiber may also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets are negatively correlated with colon cancer incidence and that insufficient fiber consumption causes colon cancer while sufficient fiber consumption prevents it.
A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning since it does not address whether the argument overlooks a possibility.
B: This answer choice is also not relevant to the argument's reasoning since it does not address whether the argument overlooks a possibility.
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument's reasoning since it does not address whether the argument overlooks a possibility.
D: This answer choice is also not relevant to the argument's reasoning since it does not address whether the argument overlooks a possibility.
E: This answer choice provides an alternative possibility to the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. It is supported by the fact that colon cancer is less common in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, and that the colon cancer rate in Scandinavia is lower in areas where there is higher consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument and does not undermine it.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument as it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
C: This statement also does not undermine the argument, as it only addresses the difficulty of including fiber in someone's diet, but it does not negate the argument's premise that sufficient fiber intake can help prevent colon cancer.
D: This statement may challenge the argument's assumption that fiber in all types of food provides the same level of cancer-fighting properties, but it does not entirely undermine the argument.
E: This statement is a possible criticism of the argument, as it suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods may also be preventing colon cancer rather than just fiber alone.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents evidence to support the claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
  A: This answer choice addresses the trend of fiber consumption but does not present any evidence that undermines the argument's conclusion.
  B: This answer choice presents evidence that may support the argument's conclusion, rather than undermining it. 
  C: This answer presents a potential limitation, but it does not address the argument's main conclusion that fiber consumption and colon cancer rates are correlated.
  D: This answer choice presents a potential limitation to the argument's conclusion by suggesting that not all types of fiber may have the same effect. 
  E: This answer choice presents evidence that may support the argument's conclusion, rather than undermining it. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that high consumption of fther-rich foods lowers the incidence of colon cancer.
  A: The argument does not mention anything about the consumption of fther changing over time, so it is irrelevant.
  B: The argument only talks about the incidence of colon cancer and does not mention anything about other types of cancer, so it is irrelevant.
  C: The argument does not address the difficulty of including fther-rich foods in people's diets, so it is irrelevant.
  D: The argument does not mention anything about the different cancer-fighting properties of fther in different foods, so it is irrelevant.
  E: The argument does not mention anything about other substances in fther-containing foods that prevent colon cancer, so it is a possibility that it overlooks.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The argument is based on the assumption that a lack of fiber causes colon cancer and that a sufficient amount of fiber can prevent it. The argument also provides supporting evidence based on correlations observed in different populations.
A: The argument doesn't depend on whether the consumption of fiber in different countries is rising or decreasing, so this choice is not directly relevant.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument about the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
C: This choice is not directly relevant to the argument that a lack of fiber causes colon cancer.
D: The argument suggests that all sources of fiber are beneficial in preventing colon cancer, so the difference in fiber content between fruits and vegetables and cereals is not relevant.
E: This choice presents an alternative explanation for the observed correlation between fiber and colon cancer. It suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods might be responsible for lowering the incidence of colon cancer, rather than fiber itself. This would weaken the argument's claim that fiber is the primary factor in preventing colon cancer.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known
  E: takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group.
  The representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not on the list, so the journalist concludes that it is not a member of the trade group.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The journalist's reasoning is flawed in that the argument does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group. This means that it is possible for Bruch Industries to be a member of the trade group, but simply not on the list that the journalist received. The argument assumes that the list is complete and includes every member of the trade group, but this assumption is not supported by any evidence.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies that belong to a manufacturers' trade group. The trade group representative confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, so the journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group. 
A: The argument does not depend on whether or not Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group. 
B: The argument states that the representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group, so the journalist does not need to present any further evidence.
C: The argument acknowledges that the document was sent inadvertently by the trade group, but it does not need to explain how that happened in order to be sound.
D: The argument does not need to present a reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership to be known, because the argument is concerned with whether or not Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group.
E: The argument relies on the accuracy of the representative's statement, but does not take that accuracy for granted, as the corroborating document and the representative's confirmation provide ample evidence. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies that belong to a manufacturers' trade group. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. Bruch Industries is not listed on the document. Therefore, the journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group.
 
Analysis: The journalist's argument is flawed because the absence of Bruch Industries from the list of companies in the document does not necessarily mean that it is not a member of the trade group. It is possible that Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group but was simply not included in the document for some reason. For example, it could be possible that the document only included companies that had recently joined the trade group or that had recently renewed their membership.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document that listed hundreds of manufacturing companies, and a representative of the trade group confirmed that all of the companies in the document were members of the trade group. The journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group because it is not listed in the document.
A: The journalist's argument does not rely on whether or not Bruch Industries wants to belong to the trade group.
B: The journalist's argument assumes that the document lists every member of the trade group, which may not be true. However, there is no evidence to suggest that it is not true.
C: The journalist's argument does not depend on how the document was inadvertently sent. 
D: The journalist's argument does not rely on whether or not Bruch Industries wants its membership in the trade group to be known.
E: The journalist's argument does take for granted the accuracy of the representative's statement without providing additional support for it.

  Bruch Industries is not listed on the document.
  
  A: This statement is true, but it is not relevant to the journalist’s reasoning.
  B: This statement is relevant because the journalist is assuming that every member of the trade group is listed in the document. If this assumption is not true, then the journalist’s reasoning is flawed.
  C: This statement is true, but it is not relevant to the journalist’s reasoning.
  D: This statement is true, but it is not relevant to the journalist’s reasoning.
  E: This statement is relevant because the journalist is assuming that the representative’s statement is accurate. If the representative had a reason to withhold information, then the journalist’s reasoning may be flawed.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document that lists hundreds of manufacturing companies that belong to a manufacturing trade group. The representative confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. Bruch Industries is not listed in the document. Hence, the journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group.
A: The argument doesn't require any reasoning for Bruch Industries to want to belong to the group. The conclusion is based on whether or not the company is a member of the trade group. 
B: This is a possibility. The argument doesn't provide information if the list of companies in the document is comprehensive and includes every member in the group.
C: This doesn't have any bearing on the conclusion drawn by the journalist. 
D: This is not relevant to the conclusion. Whether Bruch Industries wants its membership to be known or not, it would still be a member if it had joined the group.
E: This identifies a flaw in the journalist's reasoning. The journalist may have taken the representative's statement at face value without considering any ulterior motives. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The journalist was inadvertently sent a document by a manufacturer's trade group listing hundreds of manufacturing companies, and the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document is a member of the trade group. Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, and the journalist concludes that it is not a member of the trade group.
  
A: The argument is not about whether Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group or not. 
B: The argument mentions that a representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belong to the trade group. So, the argument does present evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
C: The argument is not concerned with explaining how the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document.
D: The argument is not about why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known. 
E: The argument assumes the accuracy of a statement by a representative of the trade group.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies that belongs to a certain manufacturers' trade group. The representative of the trade group later confirmed that the document listed every company that is a member of the trade group. Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, so the journalist concludes that it is not a member of the trade group.

The flaw in the journalist's reasoning is that there could be reasons why Bruch Industries is not listed in the document even though it is a member of the trade group. Therefore, the journalist cannot conclude that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group based solely on the absence of its name in the document.

  Doing modest amounts of exercise most days of the week can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  One needs only to do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on most days of the week to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
  More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Modest amounts of exercise can improve cardiovascular health.
  Brisk walking for half an hour on most days of the week can provide cardiovascular health benefits.
  More vigorous exercise is more effective, but it is not absolutely necessary.
  
A: This statement contradicts the fact that a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
B: This statement suggests that doing the equivalent of an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week is generally sufficient for producing dramatic improvements in cardiovascular health. However, the passage specifies that it is only necessary to do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week. 
C: This statement accurately reflects the passage. The passage states that obtaining cardiovascular health benefits only requires the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on most days of the week, and that a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary. 
D: This statement contradicts the fact that exercise can improve cardiovascular health.
E: This statement implies that strenuous exercise is always necessary to obtain a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health, which contradicts the fact that more modest amounts of exercise can be effective.

Action: Answer("C")

  Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. 
  One should exercise most days of the week, but half an hour of brisk walking on those days is enough for cardiovascular health benefits. 
  More vigorous exercise is more effective, but it is not absolutely necessary.
A: The statement supports that having a strenuous workout may produce improvement in cardiovascular health, but it does not support that it would be necessary or most effective.
B: The statement does not support this claim. Doing an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week is not equivalent to doing half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week.
C: The statement supports this claim. The statement states that one can achieve great improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week.
D: The statement does not support this claim. The statement is only talking about exercise being one way to improve cardiovascular health, but it doesn't deny the existence of other ways.
E: The statement does not support this claim. Although more vigorous exercise is more effective, the statement also says that a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The statements mention that "Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health" and "one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits". They also mention that more vigorous exercise is more effective but a strenuous workout is not necessary.
A: The statement suggests that a strenuous workout most days of the week produces a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health, but the statements above mention that a strenuous workout is not necessary.
B: The statements suggest that an equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week is enough to obtain cardiovascular health benefits, but it does not suggest that doing the equivalent of an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week can produce dramatic improvements in cardiovascular health.
C: This choice correctly summarizes the statements above by suggesting that doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week can produce at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health as having a strenuous workout most days of the week. Therefore, this is the correct answer.
D: The statements only suggest that exercise can improve cardiovascular health, but they do not suggest that aside from exercise, there is no way of improving cardiovascular health. Therefore, this choice is not supported.
E: This choice suggests that one must exercise strenuously at least occasionally to obtain a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health, but the statements above mention that a strenuous workout is not necessary for cardiovascular health benefits.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  One should exercise most days of the week, but one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
  More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The statements above indicate that one should exercise most days of the week and that doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. This means that it is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week. Therefore, choice C is most strongly supported by the statements above.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. One should exercise most days of the week, but one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity but still tend to reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy. 
Choice Analysis: 
  A: This answer choice is off-topic and does not explain the apparent discrepancy.
  B: This answer choice is also off-topic and does not explain the apparent discrepancy.
  C: This answer choice is irrelevant to the information presented and does not contribute to resolving the discrepancy.
  D: This answer choice suggests that creating an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks is challenging. Hence, it could explain why the leatherbacks in captivity tend to be susceptible to fatal diseases. Therefore, it resolves the apparent discrepancy in the passage.
  E: This answer choice is off-topic and not relevant to resolving the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about leatherback sea turtles and how they are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  It is surprising that whether in captivity or in the wild, the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same.

A: This statement does not address the apparent discrepancy mentioned in the question.
B: This statement does not address the apparent discrepancy mentioned in the question.
C: This statement provides an explanation for the high mortality rate of leatherbacks in the wild. It does not help to resolve the discrepancy noted in the question.
D: This statement does not help to resolve the discrepancy noted in the question.
E: If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, that would mean that captive leatherbacks could be older than they appear, which would help explain why their life expectancy is about the same as in the wild.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but still have a similar life expectancy to those in the wild. 
Choice Analysis:
  A: This choice is about diseases attacking leatherbacks compared to other large aquatic reptiles. The argument doesn't compare leatherbacks with any other animal. This choice is incorrect.
  B: This choice is about the general life expectancy of sea turtles compared to other marine animals. The argument doesn't compare leatherbacks with any other animal. This choice is incorrect.
  C: This choice explains why many leatherbacks perish in the wild. However, it does not help to resolve the apparent discrepancy - why captive and wild leatherbacks have a similar life expectancy despite fatal diseases in captivity. This choice is incorrect.
  D: This choice provides an alternative reason as to why captive leatherbacks die from fatal diseases. If few zoologists have knowledge to establish a good environment for leatherbacks, then captivity may not be a safe place for them. This choice does not help to resolve the apparent discrepancy though. This choice is incorrect.
  E: This choice presents new information about the leatherbacks: their size is not an indicator of age. However, it does not help to resolve the apparent discrepancy - why captive and wild leatherbacks have a similar life expectancy despite fatal diseases in captivity. This choice is incorrect.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity that they would not encounter in the wild. Despite this, leatherbacks have about the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity as they do in the wild.
  
A: This statement does not directly address the apparent discrepancy. It is about the diseases that affect leatherbacks, but not about their life expectancy in captivity versus in the wild.
B: This statement also does not directly address the apparent discrepancy. It is about the average life expectancy of sea turtles, but not about the likelihood of leatherbacks reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity versus in the wild.
C: This statement provides information that supports the idea that the likelihood of reaching maximum lifespan is the same in captivity and in the wild. If leatherbacks living in the wild normally die from predators rather than disease, then it would make sense that captive leatherbacks would have a similar likelihood of reaching maximum lifespan. 
D: This statement does not help to resolve the discrepancy. It addresses the difficulty of creating the right conditions for captive leatherbacks, but not how their life expectancy compares to that in the wild.
E: This statement does not help to resolve the discrepancy. It suggests that there is some uncertainty in determining the age of a leatherback, but it doesn't relate to the likelihood of reaching maximum lifespan in captivity versus in the wild.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage mentions that leatherback turtles in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they wouldn't face in the wild.
  Despite the added risk of disease in captivity, the chances of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy are about equal in captivity and in the wild.
  
  A: This statement provides information about other large aquatic reptiles, which is not relevant to the leatherback turtle.
  B: The passage discusses the leatherback turtle specifically, not sea turtles in general.
  C: This information may be interesting, but does not help to explain the apparent discrepancy between the survival rates of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
  D: This statement suggests that it is difficult to create a suitable environment for captive leatherbacks, which may contribute to their susceptibility to disease. However, it does not address the apparent discrepancy between survival rates in captivity and in the wild.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the discrepancy between survival rates in captivity and in the wild.

Action: Answer("C") 
The fact that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators helps to explain why the survival rates of leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild are about the same. Since the main threat to leatherbacks in the wild is from predators, the risk of disease in captivity may not be as significant a factor in determining the turtles' life expectancy.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage mentions that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  The passage also suggests that there is no significant difference in the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy whether a leatherback lives in captivity or the wild.
  
A: The passage does not discuss the incidence of diseases in other aquatic reptiles. It is therefore irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  B: The life expectancy of sea turtles is not relevant to the difference between the life expectancy of captive and wild leatherbacks.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  D: This statement does not help to resolve the discrepancy as it does not address the issue of the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
Leatherback sea turtles are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity that they would not come into contact with in the wild. Yet, the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its maximum life expectancy is about the same, whether it is living in the wild or in captivity.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity vs. in the wild.
B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general doesn't address the specific discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity vs in the wild.
C: This statement provides some information on what kills most leatherbacks that perish in the wild, but it does not help resolve the discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity vs in the wild.
D: If few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks, this could explain why captive leatherbacks are susceptible to diseases. However, this statement is only a potential explanation, and doesn't help resolve the discrepancy in the question.
E: This statement is also irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy between the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity vs. in the wild.
Action: Answer("C") 
Statement (C) explains that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators. This indicates that the diseases that leatherbacks are susceptible to in captivity are not as much of a factor in their maximum life expectancy as predation is in the wild. This helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Leatherback turtles are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity that they would never come across in the wild.
  It is surprising that Leatherbacks reach their maximum life expectancy whether they are in the wild or in captivity.

A: Fewer diseases attaching to leatherbacks than attacking other large aquatic reptiles does not seem to affect how likely they are to reach their maximum life expectancy. Eliminated.
B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals does not seem to explain why Leatherbacks reach their maximum life expectancy whether they are in captivity or in the wild. Eliminated.
C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators. This does not help explain how Leatherbacks reach their maximum life expectancy whether they are in captive or in the wild. Eliminated.
D: Few zoologists having sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks does not explain why Leatherbacks reach their maximum life expectancy whether they are in the wild or in captivity. Eliminated. 

E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age is the most likely answer. If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, there might be leatherbacks that are old, but not as large as other old leatherbacks. Therefore, there might be captive leatherbacks that are reaching their maximum life expectancy even though they appear smaller than some wild leatherbacks. This helps to explain how Leatherbacks reach their maximum life expectancy whether they are in the wild or in captivity.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that when kept in captivity, leatherback turtles are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not be exposed to in the wild.
  It is surprising that the likelihood of reaching maximum lifespan in captivity is the same as in the wild.
  
A: This does contradict the given information, but it doesn't resolve the apparent discrepancy mentioned in the passage.
  B: This may be true, but it is not immediately relevant to the apparent discrepancy mentioned in the passage.
  C: This fact is interesting but does not help to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the passage.
  D: This answer choice suggests a reason for the inability to keep leatherbacks in good health while in captivity but does not resolve the apparent discrepancy in the passage.
  E: This answer choice mentions age, but does not help to resolve the apparent discrepancy mentioned in the passage.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity that they wouldn't get in the wild.
  Despite that, the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and the wild.
  We need to find a statement that explains why reaching maximum life expectancy is the same across the two conditions of captivity and the wild.
Choice Analysis:
  A: Fewer diseases attaching to leatherbacks doesn't explain why maximum life expectancy is the same regardless of captivity.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general doesn't explain why leatherbacks reach maximum life expectancy at the same rate in captivity and the wild.
  C: This doesn't explain why leatherbacks reach maximum life expectancy at the same rate in the wild and in captivity.
  D: This is a possible explanation for why leatherbacks don't reach their maximum life expectancy in captivity, but it doesn't explain why they reach their maximum life expectancy at the same rate in the wild.
  E: This doesn't explain why leatherbacks reach maximum life expectancy at the same rate in captivity and the wild.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: History provides many examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. This shows that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: People correctly believe that technological innovations often cause job loss.
  B: People are often reluctant to take on new challenges.
  C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
  D: People tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations.
  E: People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety. This conclusion is based on the fact that throughout history people have strongly resisted technological innovations that would have made their working conditions better.
A: This choice provides a potential explanation for why people might resist technological innovations, but it doesn't necessarily undermine the argument that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
B: This choice might provide some support for the argument, but it also doesn't necessarily undermine the argument.
C: This choice undermines the argument by providing a competing example of technological innovation that has been embraced by workers.
D: This choice might provide some support for the argument, but it also doesn't necessarily undermine the argument.
E: This choice doesn't undermine the argument because it doesn't address the question of whether people will resist technological innovation.

A: This statement is not related to the reasoning in the argument, as the argument is not about the consequences of technological innovations.
B: This statement suggests a possible explanation for why technological innovations might be resisted, but it does not necessarily undermine the reasoning of the argument.
C: This statement undermines the reasoning of the argument because it contradicts the claim that technological innovations are always resisted by workers.
D: This statement suggests another possible explanation for why technological innovations might be resisted, but it does not necessarily undermine the reasoning of the argument.
E: This statement is not related to the reasoning in the argument, as the argument is not about the effects of technological innovations.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:

If some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, it suggests that social inertia is not an insurmountable barrier to technological change. This weakens the argument's central claim that "social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety."
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that social inertia is more powerful than the desire for comfort or safety in determining human behavior. It supports this claim by providing the historical evidence of people resisting technological innovations despite their miserable working conditions without them.

A: This answer choice does not directly concern the argument’s reasoning regarding social inertia and the desire for comfort or safety as determinants of human behavior.
B: This answer choice does not directly concern the argument’s reasoning regarding social inertia and the desire for comfort or safety as determinants of human behavior.
C: If some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, it weakens the argument's claim that social inertia is more powerful than the desire for comfort or safety in determining human behavior. This answer choice is the correct answer.
D: This answer choice goes against the argument's claim since it suggests that people do not resist technological change.
E: This answer choice does not directly concern the argument’s reasoning regarding social inertia and the desire for comfort or safety as determinants of human behavior.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety, and uses the historical resistance to technological innovations to support this claim.
  A: This statement is not directly relevant to the argument since it is about people's belief rather than their behavior.
  B: This statement is a generalization that is not directly relevant to the argument since it does not address the resistance to technological innovations.
  C: This statement weakens the argument since it provides an example that contradicts the claim that people always resist technological innovations.
  D: This statement might weaken the argument if it is true that people can adapt easily to technological innovations.
  E: This statement is not directly relevant to the argument since it is about the effect of technological innovations rather than the resistance to them.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: We can be sure that at least some halogen lamps are well crafted, because halogen lamps from most major manufacturers are on display at Furniture Labyrinth. Any item on display at Furniture Labyrinth is well crafted.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above?
Choices:
  A: We can be confident that the temperature will drop abruptly on at least one day this week, for there is a chance of storms most days this week; whenever there are storms, the temperature drops suddenly.
  B: We can be positive that there are at least a few disturbing sonnets, given that Melinda has written several different kinds of sonnets; everything Melinda writes is disturbing.
  C: We can be sure that Gianna will get at least some good mechanical work done to her car, because she can have her car worked on at any of several shops in the city, and every shop is capable of doing good mechanical work.
  D: We can be positive that at least some minnows are healthy, because many different species of minnow can be found in lakes nearby, and every lake nearby is teeming with healthy fish.
  E: We can be confident that the cornmeal used at Matteo's Trattoria is healthful and organic, since cornmeal is among the ingredients used in preparing meals there; whenever a meal is prepared at Matteo's Trattoria, only healthful, organic ingredients are used.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument above reasons that halogen lamps from most major manufacturers are on display at Furniture Labyrinth; therefore, we can be sure that at least some halogen lamps are well crafted. The argument concludes that any item on display at Furniture Labyrinth is well crafted.
A: The argument above concludes that any item on display at Furniture Labyrinth is well crafted based on the premise that halogen lamps from most major manufacturers are on display at Furniture Labyrinth. In a similar vein, this argument concludes that the temperature will drop abruptly on at least one day this week based on the premise that there is a chance of storms most days this week, and whenever there are storms, the temperature drops suddenly.
B: This argument concludes that everything Melinda writes is disturbing, based on the premise that Melinda has written several different kinds of sonnets; therefore, we can be positive that there are at least a few disturbing sonnets. The reasoning is not similar to the argument above.
C: This argument concludes that we can be sure that Gianna will get at least some good mechanical work done to her car based on the premise that she can have her car worked on at any of several shops in the city, and every shop is capable of doing good mechanical work. The reasoning is not similar to the argument above.
D: This argument concludes that some minnows are healthy based on the premise that many different species of minnow can be found in nearby lakes, and every lake nearby is teeming with healthy fish. The reasoning is not similar to the argument above.
E: This argument concludes that the cornmeal used at Matteo's Trattoria is healthful and organic based on the premise that cornmeal is among the ingredients used in preparing meals there, and whenever a meal is prepared at Matteo's Trattoria, only healthful, organic ingredients are used. The reasoning is similar to the argument above, as both conclusions are based on the premise that a certain item or ingredient is present at a particular location, and therefore it can be inferred that all items or ingredients at that location share a certain quality.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument above uses an analogy: the fact that at least some halogen lamps are well crafted is inferred from the observation that halogen lamps from most major manufacturers are on display at a store where every item on display is well crafted.
  A: The argument uses a causal relationship between storms and abrupt temperature drops to infer that the temperature will drop abruptly on at least one day this week if there is a chance of storms most days this week.
  B: The argument uses a generalization that everything Melinda writes is disturbing to infer that at least a few sonnets written by Melinda are disturbing.
  C: The argument uses a generalization that every shop is capable of doing good mechanical work to infer that Gianna will get at least some good mechanical work done to her car if she has her car worked on at any of several shops in the city.
  D: The argument uses a generalization that every lake nearby is teeming with healthy fish to infer that at least some minnows are healthy if many different species of minnow can be found in lakes nearby.
  E: The argument uses a conditional statement that only healthful, organic ingredients are used in preparing meals at Matteo's Trattoria to infer that the cornmeal used at Matteo's Trattoria is healthful and organic if cornmeal is among the ingredients used in preparing meals there.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that halogen lamps from most major manufacturers are on display at Furniture Labyrinth, and any item on display at Furniture Labyrinth is well crafted. Thus, we can be sure that at least some halogen lamps are well crafted.
  A: The argument relies on the causal relationship between storms and abrupt drops in temperature, whereas the argument above relies on the relation between an item being on display at Furniture Labyrinth and that item being well crafted.
  B: The argument relies on the causal relationship between Melinda's writing and disturbing content, whereas the argument above relies on the relation between an item being on display at Furniture Labyrinth and that item being well crafted.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the "dominance" of Harrold Foods in the soft-drink market.
  The argument uses a survey to prove that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and will continue to do so if it maintains its current market share.
  
A: This choice talks about the possibility of a wrong cause-and-effect relationship, but this is not the case in the argument.
B: This choice talks about mistaken conditions. There are no conditions discussed in the argument.
C: This choice does not apply because the argument is not about the truth or falsity of a claim.
D: This choice does not apply because the argument does not rely on a belief's truth to make a conclusion.
E: This choice talks about describing past events as if they will inevitably happen in the future. This choice is correct because the argument assumes that Harrold Foods will maintain its current market share in the future, despite the possibility that other factors could change the market conditions in the future.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument is based on the premise that any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market. The survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Therefore, the argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
A: This answer choice does not apply to the given argument.
B: This answer choice does not apply to the given argument.
C: This answer choice does not apply to the given argument.
D: This answer choice does not apply to the given argument.
E: This answer choice describes the error in the given argument. The argument assumes that the past survey results will continue to reflect the future market conditions, which may not always be true. Therefore, this answer choice accurately describes the error of describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about Harrold Foods attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero".
  The survey shows that 72% of all consumers think that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  Any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is considered to be dominant in that market.

Action: Answer("E")

The argument commits the Error of E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well. The argument's conclusion that Harrold Foods currently dominates the market because of the survey results is not necessarily true. The survey reflects the current opinion of consumers, which may change in the future. Therefore, the survey results cannot be taken as evidence that Harrold Foods will continue to dominate the market.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that Harrold Foods already dominates the soft-drink market, and therefore, they only need to maintain their current market share to continue dominating.
  A: The argument does not relate to this type of error.
  B: This error can be seen in the argument, as the argument mistakes a condition required (having more than 50% of the sales) for a condition that is sufficient to guarantee dominating the market.
  C: The argument does not relate to this type of error.
  D: The argument does not relate to this type of error.
  E: This error can be seen in the argument, as it assumes that past survey results will hold true for the future. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market based on survey results that show 72 percent of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market. 
A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
B: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
E: This answer choice correctly describes the error in the argument. The argument assumes that survey results obtained in the past will continue into the future without providing evidence to support this assumption. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that "any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market." 
  Also, the survey results show that 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market.
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market and only needs to maintain its current market share to continue doing so.

Analysis:
  The argument equates Harrold Foods dominating the market with having more than 50% of sales in that market. However, this may not be true if there are other products/companies that are also dominant in the market. The argument assumes that Harrold Foods is the only dominant player in the market simply because its product is the most popular one and has more than 50% of the sales, but it does not account for the possibility of other powerful players in the market.

Action: Answer(B)
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods already dominates the market, and it needs only to maintain its current market share to continue to do so.
  The argument is based on the premise that any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is dominant.
  The argument cites survey results to support its claim that Hero already dominates the market, and that 72% of all consumers share this opinion.
  The argument does not provide any information about the methodology of the survey or its sample size.
  
Analysis:
  The argument is based on the premise that a product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is dominant.
  However, the argument fails to consider the possibility that other factors, such as brand loyalty or market saturation, could prevent Harrold Foods from maintaining its dominant position.
  The argument also does not address the possibility that other companies could enter the market and compete with Harrold Foods for market share.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required for a certain result to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market now because "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales in the market.
  The argument assumes that the claim that "Hero" dominates the market is true.
  The argument is not based on the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition.
  The argument does not require any condition to obtain or guarantee the result.
  The argument does not treat the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
  The argument does not take evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  The argument describes survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because it has the majority of sales. However, the survey result is not sufficient to justify that the company will always dominate the market in the future.

A: This is not relevant to the argument.
B: This is not relevant to the argument.
C: This is not relevant to the argument.
D: This is not relevant to the argument.
E: This is the error in the argument. The argument describes the survey results obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that since "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales in the market, it is dominant and Harrold Foods already dominates the market. 
  A: This answer choice talks about the possibility that a given market condition may be the result of another condition. It is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This answer choice talks about mistaking a required condition for a sufficient condition. The argument seems to be making a generalization based on a statistical definition of dominance in a market. It is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This answer choice talks about treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true. It is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This answer choice talks about taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true. It is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This answer choice talks about describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well. This answer choice seems to be the best fit because the argument assumes that the market situation would remain the same in the future as it is now based on the survey results obtained in the past.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

A: The journalist did not say that all celestial objects without lithium in their atmosphere are stars with less mass than the Sun; only stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium. This choice is incorrect.
B: The journalist did not state that the nuclear furnace has "incompletely mixed the object's elements," only that the mixing is incomplete. This choice is incorrect.
C: The journalist did not say that no celestial object without lithium is a brown dwarf; only that a brown dwarf cannot consume the lithium because of its lack of a fully functional nuclear furnace. This choice is incorrect.
D: The journalist did not say that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun; only that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium. This choice is incorrect.
E: The journalist states that brown dwarfs lack a fully functional nuclear furnace and so their lithium cannot be consumed. This implies that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere, since stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium. Therefore, the correct answer is E. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Lithium presence in the atmospheres of celestial objects can help distinguish whether they are brown dwarfs or stars.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
The science journalist directly states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Since brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace, it cannot consume lithium. Therefore, any celestial body with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because it has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
  
  A: The journalist only stated that stars with less mass than the Sun don't have lithium.
  B: The journalist stated that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. However, it doesn't mean that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: The journalist never stated that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: The journalist never stated that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: The journalist stated that a brown dwarf is identified by whether or not lithium is present in its atmosphere. Also, the journalist stated that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because it has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. Therefore, E is the most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Brown dwarfs have incomplete nuclear furnaces and thus cannot consume their lithium.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.

Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The science journalist states that the presence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere means that its nuclear furnace has not fully mixed its elements. This statement supports the idea that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. None of the other statements are supported by the journalist's statements.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  
Action: Answer("B") \
Explanation: The journalist states that stars which have lithium in their atmospheres have not fully mixed the elements in their internal nuclear furnaces. Thus, they have incomplete fusion and are at least as massive as the Sun. The journalist also states that brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace, and therefore their lithium cannot be consumed. This implies that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere must have an incomplete fusion process in its internal nuclear furnace. Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements is that "Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements." This is option B.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets and less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified based on their mass and the presence of lithium in their atmosphere.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmosphere due to incomplete mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so they cannot consume lithium.
  
A: The journalist mentions that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium. However, this statement does not imply that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.
B: The journalist mentions that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements is incorrect. The mixing of elements in a star's internal nuclear furnace is incomplete if it still has lithium in its atmosphere. However, this does not mean that a celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. Therefore, B is incorrect.
C: The journalist mentions that brown dwarfs cannot have lithium in their atmosphere. Therefore, this statement is consistent with the idea that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf. Thus, C is correct.
D: The journalist mentions that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmosphere. However, this does not imply that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun. Therefore, D is incorrect.
E: The journalist mentions that brown dwarfs cannot consume lithium because they do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace. However, this statement does not imply that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere. Therefore, E is incorrect.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Lithium is present in the atmospheres of stars that are at least as massive as the Sun because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  There is no lithium in stars with less mass than the Sun because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so their lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("E")  
The science journalist's statement only talks about lithium in relation to brown dwarfs, stars that are at least as massive as the Sun, and stars with less mass than the Sun. The journalist states that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because it has been consumed. Brown dwarfs, which do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace, still have lithium because it cannot be consumed. Therefore, it is most strongly supported by the journalist's statements that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. 
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("E")  
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. 
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the sun have no lithium because the element has fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. 
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets and less mass than stars.
  2. Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  3. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  4. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  5. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("B") 
The science journalist's statements strongly support that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.

Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.

Topic: Law
Context: Government official: Residents who are foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. This is wise, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. So, ____.
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the government official's statement?
Choices:
  A: foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve
  B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries

Knowledge: The argument is that foreign citizens can serve as public servants, but not as cabinet secretaries, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens. Cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as the cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Option A is not relevant to the argument and there is no evidence indicating that the foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship.
Option B is the most logically completing statement of the government official's argument. Since the cabinet undersecretary may have to perform the same duties as a cabinet secretary, it is illogical to appoint foreign citizens as cabinet undersecretaries.
Option C doesn't make logical sense since the statement doesn't suggest this.
Option D contradicts the government official's premise that some duties must be performed only by citizens and is not supported by the argument.
Option E is not logically completing the government official's argument, it is illogical to suggest that the undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for the cabinet secretaries.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The government official believes that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should only be performed by citizens. Cabinet undersecretaries are expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries when they are not available. 
  A: This choice suggests granting citizenship to foreign citizens who serve as public servants, but it doesn't provide any logic to complete the argument presented.
  B: This choice goes beyond cabinet secretaries and argues against foreign citizens serving as cabinet undersecretaries. It is not relevant to the argument presented.
  C: This choice suggests only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries, but it doesn't provide any logic to support the argument presented.
  D: This choice contradicts the government official's argument that cabinet secretaries perform duties that should only be performed by citizens. Therefore, it cannot logically complete the government official's statement.
  E: This choice contradicts the argument that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries when they are not available.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The government official believes that:
- Foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries
- Cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens
- A cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable

A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument that cabinet secretaries should be citizens and does not logically complete the official's statement.
B: This choice would strengthen the argument for not appointing foreign citizens to cabinet secretaries, but it does not logically complete the official's statement.
C: This choice provides a condition for appointment that is not based on citizenship and is irrelevant to the official's argument.
D: This choice contradicts the official's argument and would weaken the official's position.
E: This choice contradicts the information provided in the argument that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Recall:
  - Foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, except for being cabinet secretaries due to certain duties that only citizens should perform.
  - A cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Analysis:
  The government official explains the rationale behind not having foreign citizens serve as cabinet secretaries, which includes certain duties that only citizens should perform and the need for cabinet undersecretaries to serve as cabinet secretaries when necessary. Therefore, the option that most logically completes the official's statement should be in agreement with these reasons.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
  Option B states that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries, which is consistent with the official's argument since they may have to perform some of the duties reserved for citizens, and undersecretaries may have to stand in for the secretary. Therefore, option B best completes the official's statement.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument presented is that foreign citizens can serve as public servants except for cabinet secretaries because these officials have some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  
A: This answer is not relevant to the conclusion that the argument is making.
B: This answer is a possible conclusion, but it is the opposite of the government official's argument that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels.
C: There is no evidence to support that only former cabinet undersecretaries meet the requirement for becoming a cabinet secretary.
D: This answer contradicts the argument made by the government official.
E: This answer is also a possible conclusion, but it does not logically complete the argument presented by the government official that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument states that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries because the latter have some duties that should be performed only by citizens. Additionally, cabinet undersecretaries are expected to take on the role of the cabinet secretary, so they should be citizens as well. 
A: The argument does not discuss citizenship granting, so this cannot complete the statement.
B: This statement does not fit with the argument because the argument does not discuss undersecretaries' citizenship status, only the responsibilities of the cabinet secretary.
C: This statement suggests that only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries. However, the argument does not state that undersecretaries should become secretaries; it suggests that undersecretaries may need to stand in if the secretary is unavailable. Therefore, this is not the best choice to complete the statement.
D: This statement opposes the argument's line of reasoning as foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries according to the argument. Hence, this cannot complete the statement.
E: This statement contradicts the argument's suggestion that undersecretaries should be able to serve as secretaries if necessary. Therefore, this cannot complete the statement. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The government official believes that some duties of cabinet secretaries should only be performed by citizens and that no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform.
  The official further explains that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. 
  The official has already mentioned that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  The official is discussing why foreign citizens cannot serve as cabinet secretaries due to the duties that may be required only of citizens. Further, an explanation is provided that a cabinet undersecretary may have to serve as a cabinet secretary, indicating that it is important for the undersecretary to be a citizen since the duties of secretary can only be performed by citizens. Thus, the official's statement is logically completed by saying that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries. Choice B completes the statement most logically.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries due to certain duties that should only be performed by citizens. 
  Additionally, cabinet undersecretaries may be expected to serve as cabinet secretaries, so this requirement should be taken into consideration when appointing individuals to high-level positions.
  
  A: This statement is not relevant to, nor does it logically complete, the government official's argument.
  B: This statement is a logical extension of the argument because it follows the same line of reasoning as the conclusion. If cabinet secretaries should not be foreign citizens because they may have to perform certain duties that require citizenship, then it follows that the same would be true for cabinet undersecretaries.
  C: This statement is not a logical extension of the argument and is not relevant to the conclusion as it does not address citizenship requirements for cabinet secretaries.
  D: This statement contradicts the government official's argument, which is that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  E: This statement is not a logical extension of the argument and is not relevant to the conclusion as it does not address the issue of standing in for cabinet secretaries. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The government official believes that non-citizens can serve as public servants at most levels except cabinet secretaries, since they perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  
  A: This choice is not directly related to the argument. Whether or not foreign citizens should be granted citizenship is not the central point discussed by the government official.
  B: This choice suggests that foreign citizens should not serve as cabinet undersecretaries, but the argument does not provide a supporting reason for this conclusion.
  C: This choice suggests that only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries, but the argument does not provide a supporting reason for this conclusion.
  D: This conflicts with the argument, since the government official believes that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform.
  E: This conflicts with the argument, since the government official notes that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that there are some duties that should only be performed by citizens.
  Cabinet undersecretaries may perform the duties of the actual secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Foreign citizens are allowed to serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Given that cabinet undersecretaries may perform the duties of the actual secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable, and that foreign citizens are not allowed to serve as cabinet secretaries, it is logical to conclude that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries. If they were appointed as undersecretaries, they would be expected to perform duties that the government official suggests should be performed only by citizens.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate and offset wetland development to protect wildlife and habitat.
  The Figorian Development Commission opposes these regulations since they do not believe that Figorian wetland development would affect wildlife; they want to allow development for growth and believe that they have the right to govern Figoria's resources. 

A: The principle suggests that national resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered. This principle does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position, which advocates against regulation in favor of developing wetlands to support economic growth.
B: The principle is in favor of the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position since it places the importance of preserving wildlife over the economic needs of individual nations.
C: The principle suggests that regulation should only take place once further damage has already occurred. This does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position since they want to allow development without regulation.
D: The principle opposes the Figorian Development Commission's position since it suggests that environmental regulations should aim to prevent further damage, regardless of the extent to which different nations have harmed the environment.
E: The principle has no clear position on the issue of developing wetlands in Figoria and therefore cannot be used to support either position. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development to protect endangered species by offsetting it with the construction of replacement wetland habitats so that there is no net reduction of wetlands.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figoria has as much right to govern its resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use and that wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered - This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position of regulating wetland development to protect wildlife in Figoria and is not in line with the Figorian Development Commission's position.
B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations - This principle would also support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position to regulate wetland development to protect wildlife in Figoria, and is not in line with the Figorian Development Commission's position.
C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage - This position is not aligned with either of the commissions since the Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate development before damage occurs, and the Figorian Development Commission wants to allow development if it might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment - This principle is more in line with the Figorian Development Commission's position, as it supports Figoria's right to develop its resources and is not concerned with offsetting the effect of development on wildlife.
E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources - This principle is more in line with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position and is not in line with the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission's position: regulate wetland development in Figoria and build replacement wetlands to protect wildlife. 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position: allow wetland development in Figoria as necessary for growth and conservation, and Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.

Analysis:
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth. They also claimed that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources, and that they have conserved more than other nations that have developed their wetlands.

Action: Answer("D")  
Principle D supports the Figorian Development Commission's position by saying that environmental regulation must prevent any further damage, taking into account the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that wetland development should be regulated to protect wildlife by constructing replacement wetland habitats. 
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that wetland development is necessary for growth and they have the right to govern their own resources.
  The question asks which principle would most support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  A: This principle supports international regulation of national resources when wildlife is endangered, which does not directly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  B: This principle supports the preservation of wildlife over the economic needs of individual nations, which directly opposes the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  C: This principle supports regulating commercial development only after damage has been done to endangered species populations, which does not directly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  D: This principle supports preventing any further environmental damage, which directly opposes the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  E: This principle supports the prevention of depletion of natural resources, which does not directly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
- Figorian Wildlife Commission supports regulating wetland development in Figoria to protect wildlife and requires the creation of replacement wetland habitats to offset the loss of wetlands.
- Figorian Development Commission opposes the regulation of wetland development in Figoria, citing the need for growth and the right of nations to govern their own resources.
- The question asks which principle would support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.

Analysis:
- A does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position, as it suggests that international agreement should be used to regulate resources when wildlife is endangered.
- B does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position, as it prioritizes future generations' right to have wildlife preserved over economic needs.
- C does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position, as it suggests regulating commercial development only after reduction of endangered species populations, whereas the Figorian Wildlife Commission seeks to regulate to prevent such reductions from happening.
- D does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position, as it suggests regulation should aim at preventing any further environmental damage, regardless of the different degrees to which different countries have harmed the environment.
- E supports the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position by suggesting that allowing further depletion of natural resources may be acceptable.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The Figorian Wildlife Commission advocates for regulation of wetland development via constructing replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife. The Figorian Development Commission believes that wetland development should be allowed as Figoria has conserved wetlands and development is necessary for growth. The Figorian Development Commission thinks that Figoria should have as much right to govern its own resources as other countries do.
A: The principle of an international agreement for regulating national resources when wildlife is endangered might support the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it would not support the Figorian Development Commission.
B: The principle of preserving wildlife for future generations over the economic needs of individual nations would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission and go against the Figorian Development Commission, so it is not the correct answer.
C: The principle of implementing regulation only after a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found would support the idea of using the "wait and see" approach to regulation. However, this would not support the Figorian Development Commission.
D: The principle of environment regulation aiming at preventing further environmental damage and not taking into account the different degrees of environmental harm done by different countries is not related to the discussion between the Figorian Wildlife Commission and the Figorian Development Commission.
E: The principle of preventing further depletion of natural resources might support the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it would not support the Figorian Development Commission.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Development Commission argues that it is necessary to allow wetland development in Figoria and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources. They also argue that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife. 

A: This principle suggests that national resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered. However, it does not support either of the two positions presented in the argument. 
B: This principle suggests that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations. However, it does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it prioritizes wildlife preservation over economic growth. 
C: This principle suggests that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species has been found. This principle does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it implies that regulation should be implemented once a reduction in population has been found. 
D: This principle suggests that environmental regulation must prevent further environmental damage and cannot allow for different degrees of harm caused by different nations. However, it does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it implies that Figoria should be regulated in the same way as other nations that have already harmed their environment. 
E: This principle proposes that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources. This principle is consistent with the Figorian Development Commission's position because it suggests that economic growth is a necessity and that Figoria should have the right to develop its resources.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development to protect endangered species.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that they have the right to develop their own resources for economic growth, and they claim that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife.
  A: This principle supports international regulation of national resources when wildlife is endangered, which is contrary to the Figorian Development Commission's argument for the right to govern their own resources.
  B: This principle prioritizes wildlife preservation over the economic needs of individual nations, which is contrary to the Figorian Development Commission's argument for economic growth.
  C: This principle suggests that regulation should only be implemented when there is already a reduction in endangered species, which is contrary to the Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument for proactive regulation.
  D: This principle suggests that regulation must prevent any further environmental damage, which supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument for proactive regulation.
  E: This principle argues against further depletion of natural resources, but it is not clear how it relates to the conflict between the Figorian Wildlife Commission and the Figorian Development Commission.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development to protect wildlife by offsetting the development with the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  Figorian Development Commission opposes the Figorian Wildlife Commission and wants to allow development, arguing that it may not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  
  A: This principle would support international regulation of national resources to protect endangered wildlife and would not support either the Figorian Development Commission or the Figorian Wildlife Commission's positions.
  B: This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position to regulate development to protect wildlife and would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position to allow for development.
  C: This principle would condition regulation on a reduction in the populations of endangered species, which is not in line with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's principle of offsetting development with the construction of replacement wetlands to protect species.
  D: This principle argues against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position by saying that environmental regulation cannot consider the degree of damage already done by different nations, which supports the Figorian Development Commission's argument that Figoria should be able to govern its own resources like other nations that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
  E: This principle would not support either position because it argues against further depletion of natural resources but does not address how to protect endangered species.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The Figorian Wildlife Commission is advocating for wetland development to be offset by construction of replacement wetland habitats, in order to protect wildlife.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The columnist is arguing that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights is not being passed because those who would be adversely affected are very influential.
  A: This principle is not valid according to the argument presented in the passage. The columnist is arguing that despite most people favoring the bill, it will not be passed.
  B: This principle supports the columnist's reasoning, as it suggests that a bill favored by most people but opposed by influential people may not pass in a democracy.
  C: This principle is similar to A, and the columnist is arguing that even if a bill is favored by most people, it may not pass if those who oppose it are influential.
  D: This principle does not address the issue raised in the passage about influential people preventing a bill from becoming law.
  E: This principle is similar to A and C, and the columnist is arguing that even if a bill is favored by most people, it may not pass if those who oppose it are influential.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist argues that a bill that most people favor and does not violate basic human rights will not become a law due to the opposition of influential people.
  A: This principle does not support the columnist's argument because it assumes that any bill that benefits most people will become a law, which is not the case in this scenario.
  B: This principle provides some support for the columnist's argument because it states that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law in a well-functioning democracy. However, it does not imply a specific timeline for the passage of the bill.
  C: This principle best supports the columnist's argument because it states that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. This principle acknowledges the influence of opposition on the passage of a bill.
  D: This principle does not support the columnist's argument because it assumes that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights, which is not the case in this scenario.
  E: This principle does not support the columnist's argument because it assumes that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, which is not the case in this scenario.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The columnist is arguing that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate basic human rights will not be passed into law due to the opposition of influential people.
  A: This principle states that any bill that would benefit most people and does not violate any basic human rights should be passed into law within a few years in a well-functioning democracy. This principle does not align with the columnist's reasoning, as the bill in question meets these criteria but is still not passed into law.
  B: This principle states that any bill that is opposed by influential people but is favored by most other people will eventually pass into law if the democracy is well-functioning. This aligns with the columnist's argument that the bill may not be passed due to the influence of opposing individuals.
  C: This principle states that a bill favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. This aligns with the columnist's argument that the opposing influential individuals are preventing the bill from passing into law.
  D: This principle does not align with the columnist's reasoning as it states that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights. The argument is that this bill meets these criteria, but is still not passed into law.
  E: This principle states that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights. This aligns with the columnist's argument that the bill should be passed since it meets these criteria, but is not passed due to opposing influential individuals.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating basic human rights will not become law because those who oppose it are very influential.
A: This principle implies that any bill that would benefit most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights should be passed into law within a few years. However, this principle is in contrast with the columnist's argument since the bill, even favored by most people and not violating basic human rights, has not been passed and will not be passed.
B: This principle supports the columnist's argument since it implies that even if a bill is opposed by influential people, it should eventually pass into law if most other people favor it. However, this does not seem to be the case since the columnist suggests that bills like the one in question will not pass at all.
C: This principle supports the columnist's argument since it implies that a bill favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. This is consistent with the columnist's argument that influential people are blocking the passage of the bill.
D: This principle is not relevant to the columnist's argument that the bill will not be passed because influential people are blocking it, regardless of whether the bill is consistent with individuals' basic human rights or not.
E: This principle implies that a bill favored by most people and not violating basic human rights should be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy. However, this principle is in contrast with the columnist's argument since the bill, even favored by most people and not violating basic human rights, has not been passed and will not be passed.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The columnist argues that a bill that most people favor and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law because those who oppose it are very influential.
A: This principle directly contradicts the columnist's reasoning by stating that any bill that would benefit most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will be passed into law within a few years in a well-functioning democracy. 
B: This principle supports the columnist's reasoning by stating that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law if the democracy is well-functioning.

Response 5:
Knowledge:
The columnist believes that a well-functioning democracy would pass a bill that benefits most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights, even if it is opposed by influential people. The columnist claims that the fact that such bills are not being passed indicates that this country is not a well-functioning democracy.
A: This principle suggests that any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights. However, the columnist's argument is not based on this principle.
B: This principle most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning since it suggests that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This aligns with the columnist's belief that influential people are preventing the passage of a bill supported by the majority of people.
C: This principle suggests that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. However, it does not align with the columnist's belief that influential people are preventing the passage of a bill supported by the majority of people.
D: This principle suggests that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights. While this may be true, it is not relevant to the columnist's argument.
E: This principle suggests that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights. While this principle aligns with the columnist's belief that a bill supported by the majority of people and consistent with human rights should be passed, it does not address the issue of influential people opposing the bill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and that does not violate anyone's basic human rights may not become law if the people who are negatively impacted by the bill are very influential.

A: This principle does not support the columnist's reasoning.
B: This principle supports the columnist's reasoning, as it suggests that a bill that is favored by most people but opposed by influential people will eventually pass into law only if the democracy is well-functioning.
C: This principle supports the columnist's reasoning, as it suggests that a bill that is favored by most people but opposed by influential people may not become law in a well-functioning democracy.
D: This principle is not relevant to the columnist's reasoning.
E: This principle is similar to option A and does not support the columnist's reasoning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The columnist is arguing that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights is not being passed because those who oppose it are very influential. Therefore, he is suggesting that this is an indication of a poorly functioning democracy.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Choice C best supports the columnist's reasoning. It suggests that for a bill that is favored by most people to pass into law within a few years, the opposition must not be very influential. This aligns with the columnist's argument that the bill will not pass because the opposition is very influential. Choice A is incorrect because it implies that any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years, regardless of whether the opposition is influential or not. Choice B is also incorrect because it assumes that any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. However, this is not necessarily true, especially if the influential opposition is able to use their influence to prevent the bill from being passed. Choice D is incorrect because it suggests that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and consistent with individual's basic human rights. However, this argument does not address the issue of influential opposition. Choice E is also incorrect because it suggests that a bill favored by most people will be passed promptly into law, regardless of the influence of the opposition.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: 
The columnist argues that the fact that a bill that most people favor and does not violate anyone's basic human rights is not passed into law, shows that the democracy is not functioning well. This implies that the bill is being opposed by influential people, who have the ability to prevent its passing. Therefore, the principle that best justifies the columnist's reasoning is that "If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law." Choice (B) best captures this principle.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The columnist argues that a bill that benefits most people and does not violate basic human rights may not pass into law if those who oppose it are very influential.

A: This principle suggests that a bill that benefits most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights, regardless of the influence of those who oppose it. This contradicts the columnist's argument.
B: This principle supports the columnist's argument that even if most people favor a bill, it will not pass into law if those who oppose it are influential.
C: This principle is similar to choice A, but it also acknowledges the influence of those who oppose a bill. However, it is still not consistent with the columnist's argument, which does not require the opposition to be unanimous.
D: This principle is too strong and does not allow for bills to be passed even if they do not benefit most people. It is also not consistent with the columnist's argument since it assumes that all bills passed into law are favored by most people and consistent with basic human rights.
E: This principle is similar to choice A, but it specifies that the bill must be passed promptly, which is not relevant to the columnist's argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise
  C: criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself
  D: taking lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim
  E: presupposing what it sets out to establish
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The editorial makes an argument against the premier's economic advisor's advice.
  A: This is not a questionable argumentative strategy as an implementation of a proposal can certainly fail.
  B: This is a questionable argumentative strategy as it involves playing on people's fears rather than providing a logical reason for accepting the conclusion.
  C: This is a questionable argumentative strategy as it involves criticizing the source rather than examining the evidence provided.
  D: This is a questionable argumentative strategy as lack of evidence is not in and of itself evidence undermining a claim.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the current configuration of fingers in humans is no more or less useful than other possible configurations, and that we would be just as content if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument, which is about the possible configurations of fingers.
  B: This statement does not support the biologist's argument, and it is a generalization that is not necessarily true.
  C: This statement does not support the biologist's argument, and it is a generalization that is not necessarily true.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument, as it suggests that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective criteria.
  E: This statement is relevant to the biologist's argument, as it suggests that having six fingers on each hand is a possible configuration that could have emerged in humans.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The biologist is arguing that the number of fingers that humans have is not necessarily the optimal or most useful configuration.
  The argument is based on the idea that humans could have evolved to have a different number of fingers depending on the evolution of the fish that our ancestors descended from.
  
A: This statement is irrelevant to the biologist's argument, as the argument is not about the contentment of humans with their current number of fingers but the possibility of humans being equally content with a different number of fingers.
B: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans cannot be equally content with two things of unequal usefulness. However, the biologist is arguing that the usefulness of the configuration of fingers is not necessarily tied to the contentment of humans.
C: This statement is irrelevant to the biologist's argument, as the argument is not about the contentment of humans with their current number of fingers but the possibility of humans being equally content with a different number of fingers.
D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that the perceived usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is due to our prejudices. This reinforces the idea that a different configuration of fingers could be just as useful as our current one.
E: This statement is supportive of the biologist's argument, as it suggests that a different species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, which supports the idea that a different configuration of fingers could be possible.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - The biologist's argument is that the number of fingers we have is not based on their usefulness, but rather on evolutionary history.
  A: This answer choice is not relevant as it does not provide evidence about why our current configuration of fingers is not based on their usefulness.
  B: This answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting humans are not content with unequal usefulness, which goes against the biologist's point that our configuration is not based on usefulness.
  C: This answer choice weakens the argument because it is not true that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness. People have different preferences and some may prefer one thing over the other even if they are equally useful.
  D: This answer choice strengthens the argument by suggesting that our perceived usefulness of our current finger configuration is not based on objective factors, but rather on our prejudices.
  E: This answer choice is not relevant to the biologist's argument. It provides evidence that some fish have six phalanges, but it does not provide any evidence to support or refute the argument that our finger configuration is based on evolutionary history.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that humans' five fingers are not more or less useful than several other possible configurations, like six fingers per hand. Therefore, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and six fingers on each hand, we would be just as content with that configuration.

A: This statement has no impact on the biologist's argument, as it doesn't relate to the argument's premise or conclusion.
B: This statement undermines the biologist's argument, suggesting humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
C: This statement too is not aligned with the argument's premise or conclusion, and it presents a generalization that might not be true in all cases.
D: This statement aligns with the biologist's argument that our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices, presuming that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is, in fact, illusory.
E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument, suggesting there was at least one species of fish that had six phalanges in its fins.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The biologist's argument is that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, and that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
A: This statement does not provide information on whether the different numbers of fingers would affect contentment, and it does not address the argument specifically.
B: This statement suggests that if two things are of unequal usefulness, humans are not equally content with them. However, this does not directly address the argument that a different configuration of fingers would be equally useful and lead to equal contentment.
C: This statement is consistent with the biologist's argument, but it does not strengthen it. It simply restates the assumption that humans are equally content with things of equal usefulness.
D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that our perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is a result of our prejudices. It strengthens the argument by suggesting that our current configuration is not objectively more useful than other configurations, and that our contentment with it is based on an illusion.
E: This statement provides support for the biologist's argument that there are other possible configurations of fingers. However, it does not address the argument that these configurations would be equally useful and lead to equal contentment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's argument is that humans could have been just as content with six fingers per hand, and that our current configuration of five fingers is not necessarily better or worse than other possible configurations.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument being made by the biologist.
  B: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument by claiming that humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement supports the biologist's argument, but does not strengthen it, because it simply repeats the same assertion that the biologist made.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by claiming that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is based on our prejudices, rather than any inherent superiority or inferiority of our configuration. However, it does not strengthen the argument beyond the biologist's own claims.
  E: This statement provides support for the biologist's argument by suggesting that a fish with six phalanges in its fins is not an implausible hypothetical precursor to humans with six fingers per hand.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that humans' five fingers are no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. The argument is based on the premise that prejudices are responsible for our believing that our configuration of fingers is more useful.
  A: This statement is irrelevant as it does not address the argument and it does not provide evidence for the biologist's claim.
  B: This statement is actually contrary to the biologist's argument and hence weakens it.
  C: This statement actually supports the biologists argument, but it does not strengthen it, as the argument does not depend on it.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument as it provides evidence for the premise that prejudices are responsible for our belief. Hence choice D most strengthens the biologist's argument.
  E: This statement is irrelevant as it does not relate to the specific argument that the biologist is making about the relation between the number of fingers that humans have and the number of phalanges in the fins of a fish ancestor.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist believes that the human hands with five fingers are no more or less useful than other possible configurations, given that we are just accustomed to it.
  A: This answer choice does not address the argument made in the passage.
  B: This answer choice contradicts the biologist's argument.
  C: This answer choice does not address the argument made in the passage.
  D: This answer choice supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that it is our prejudices or perceptions that make us believe that our current hands configuration is more useful than other possible ones.
  E: This answer choice does not necessarily strengthen the biologist's argument. It is merely a fact that there is a species of fish with six phalanges.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers we have is not necessarily the "best" number, but rather a result of our evolutionary history.
  A: This answer choice does not provide any information to support the biologist's argument. 
  B: This answer choice actually weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans cannot be content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This answer choice also weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness, whereas the biologist argues that the usefulness of our fingers is not the only factor determining our contentment with them.
  D: This answer choice supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not necessarily accurate, and may be biased by our prejudices.
  E: This answer choice actually weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that there is at least one species of fish with six phalanges in its fins, which goes against the biologist's hypothetical scenario.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist believes that humans would be equally content with other configurations of fingers such as six per hand.
  A: This statement does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's claim.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is too general and does not address the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers may be based on our prejudices rather than on objective factors.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Dried parsley should never be used in cooking, for it is far less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley is.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most clearly helps to justify the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
  B: Only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used in cooking.
  C: Ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful.
  D: Parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking.
  E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  The argument is that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  A: This principle is too broad and doesn't specifically address the issue of dried vs. fresh parsley.
  B: This principle is too narrow and doesn't address the healthfulness of the ingredient.
  C: This principle is too extreme and doesn't provide any guidance on when certain ingredients should be used.
  D: This principle is too specific and doesn't address the general principle of using fresh ingredients.
  E: This principle provides a valid justification for the argument, as it states that in cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.

Therefore, the best answer is E.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The argument claims that dried parsley should not be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
- A valid principle is one that supports the argument.

Analysis:
- Principles A, B, and D do not match the argument and are too extreme or not relevant enough to justify the argument.
- Principle C is too general and not specific enough to justify the argument.
- Principle E matches the argument's claim that dried parsley is inferior to fresh parsley in cooking, and it is a valid and general principle that can support the argument.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  A: This choice is too broad since it does not mention parsley specifically, and it does not necessarily imply that dried parsley is bad.
  B: This choice is too extreme. It does not consider other factors beyond taste.
  C: This choice is too broad since it does not mention parsley specifically.
  D: This choice is too extreme since it implies that parsley has to be both tasty and healthful at all times.
  E: This choice specifically mentions dried ingredients, which supports the argument's claim about dried parsley.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
- The argument claims that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
- A: Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible. This statement is similar to the argument, but it is too general and does not address parsley specifically.
- B: Only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used in cooking. This statement is too extreme and unhelpful since taste is subjective.
- C: Ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful. This statement is too general and does not address parsley specifically.
- D: Parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking. This statement is too extreme and unhelpful since it does not address the relative tastiness and healthfulness of different types of parsley.
- E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients. This statement helps to justify the argument because it addresses the specific issue of dried parsley being inferior to fresh parsley.

Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument claims that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley and it should never be used in cooking. 
A: This principle, if valid, supports the argument by suggesting that fresh ingredients should be used in preference to dried ingredients.
B: This principle is not valid because it is not necessary for an ingredient to be the "tastiest" to be used in cooking.
C: This principle is not valid because some ingredients, such as salt, are not healthful but are commonly used in cooking to enhance flavor.
D: This principle is not valid because an ingredient does not need to be both tasty and healthful to be used in cooking.
E: This principle, if valid, supports the argument by suggesting that dried ingredients are inferior in taste and healthfulness to fresh ingredients.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
- The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
- A: This answer choice is relevant to the topic, but it is too general to specifically justify the argument.
- B: This answer is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not claim that only the tastiest ingredients should be used in cooking.
- C: This answer choice is not general enough to justify the argument. Additionally, it is not always true that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful.
- D: This answer choice is too specific to the argument. The argument does not provide any information about the conditions under which parsley should be used in cooking.
- E: This answer choice most directly supports the argument by stating that in cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ones.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument asserts that fresh parsley is better in cooking than dried parsley. Therefore, the correct option should provide a principle that supports this assertion.
  A: This is partially relevant, but it does not directly support the idea that fresh parsley is better. It is a general principle that is not specifically related to parsley or taste/healthfulness.
  B: This is not relevant, as the argument does not discuss taste as the only criterion for selecting ingredients.
  C: This is partially relevant, but it does not directly support the idea that fresh parsley is better. It is a general principle that is not specifically related to parsley.
  D: This is too extreme. The argument does not suggest that parsley needs to be both tasty and healthful, but rather that fresh parsley is better than dried parsley.
  E: This is the most relevant principle that supports the argument above because it directly addresses the issue of fresh vs. dried ingredients in cooking.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
- The argument is that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
- Choices A, B, and D are too extreme or too narrow to justify the argument.
- Choice C is too broad because it says "ingredients that should never be used in cooking," not specifying dried parsley as the subject of discussion.

The principle that justifies the argument is that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients. Choice E expresses this principle.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley. 
  A: The principle that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible is generally a good rule of thumb, but it does not necessarily apply to all ingredients. 
  B: The argument claims that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley. However, this does not mean that only the tastiest ingredients should be used in cooking. 
  C: While the argument claims that dried parsley is neither tasty nor healthful, this principle is too general to justify the argument above. Additionally, it does not consider the possibility that some dried ingredients may be tasty and healthful. 
  D: This principle is similar to the argument above. However, the argument only claims that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley, not that all parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking. 
  E: This principle justifies the argument above, as it claims that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients in cooking. 

Action: Answer("E")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely to be an actuary rather than an accountant because the mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement are more typical of an actuary than an accountant.
  A: This weakens the detective's argument by providing an alternative explanation for why the embezzlement might have been discovered and by suggesting that the embezzlement could have been committed by an accountant who was not closely scrutinized.
  B: This weakens the detective's argument by providing an alternative explanation for how someone outside the company might have gained access to the internal financial records.
  C: This does not weaken the detective's argument because it provides information about the numbers of accountants and actuaries on the company's staff that is not directly related to the detective's argument.
  D: This does not weaken the detective's argument because it provides information about the company's vulnerability to embezzlement before the crime took place and is not directly related to the detective's argument.
  E: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that it would have been more difficult for an actuary than an accountant to commit the embezzlement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The detective's argument is about how the embezzler might be one of the actuaries.
- A: This weakens the detective's argument as it suggests that the accountants can also be closely monitored and could have made mistakes.
- B: This weakens the detective's argument as it suggests that someone outside the company could have gained access to the internal financial records and committed the crime.
- C: This is irrelevant to the detective's argument as it only gives the number of accountants and actuaries working at XYZ Corporation.
- D: This is irrelevant to the detective's argument as it only provides information about the company's vulnerability to embezzlement before the crime took place.
- E: This weakens the detective's argument as it suggests that it is less likely for actuaries to have access to the internal financial records than the accountants.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The detective has made an argument based on the premise that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the mistakes that led to the discovery of the crime.
  A: If the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized than the accountants', then this would suggest that an actuary would be less likely to successfully commit a crime such as embezzlement and would weaken the detective's argument. 
  B: If persons outside the corporation could have had access to the records, then it is less likely that an actuary or accountant committed the crime, and this would weaken the detective's argument.
  C: The number of accountants and actuaries employed by the corporation is not relevant to the detective's argument.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that the corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement. This does not weaken the detective's argument.
  E: This choice suggests that the actuaries would have had a harder time committing the crime, which would strengthen the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
The detective believes that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries, since they had specialized knowledge, and the accountant is unlikely to make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
A: This statement suggests that the actuaries may have been more closely scrutinized than the accountants, which, if true, would weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely to be an actuary. Therefore, this statement is not the correct answer.
B: This statement suggests that someone outside XYZ Corporation could have had access to internal financial records, which would weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler is an employee of XYZ Corporation. Therefore, this statement weakens the detective's argument.
C: This statement suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, which weakens the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely to be an actuary. Therefore, this statement weakens the detective's argument.
D: This statement suggests that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement even before the crime took place, which does not impact the detective's argument that the embezzler is an actuary.
E: This statement suggests that the security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records, which weakens the detective's argument that the embezzler is an actuary. Therefore, this statement weakens the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: This weakens the detective's argument because the more closely scrutinized activities of the actuaries could mean that they are less likely to be the embezzler.
  B: This weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that someone outside of the corporation could have gained access to the financial records.
  C: This does not weaken the detective's argument because it does not address the likelihood of accountants versus actuaries being the embezzler.
  D: This does not weaken the detective's argument because it does not address the likelihood of accountants versus actuaries being the embezzler.
  E: This weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that the actuaries may have had less access to financial records than accountants.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries.
  A: This weakens the detective's argument because if the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized, then it is less likely that an actuary would have the opportunity to embezzle.
  B: This weakens the detective's argument because if someone outside of the corporation had access to the financial records, then it is less likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
  C: This is irrelevant because it does not affect the detective's argument.
  D: This is irrelevant because it does not affect the detective's argument.
  E: This weakens the detective's argument because if it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to the financial records, then it is less likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries, as they had both specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records.
  A: This weakens the argument, as it suggests that the accountants may have been just as closely scrutinized and therefore just as unlikely to make mistakes as the actuaries.
  B: This weakens the argument, as it suggests that someone outside the company may have had access to the records and committed the crime.
  C: This does not weaken the argument.
  D: This does not weaken the argument.
  E: This weakens the argument, as it suggests that it would have been more difficult for an actuary to have committed the crime.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The detective argued that the embezzler is one of the actuaries based on the assumption that accountants would not make mistakes leading to discovery, and that the embezzler must have specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records.
  A: This weakens the argument because if the actuaries were more closely scrutinized, then it would have been more difficult for them to embezzle.
  B: This weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside the company could have had access to the financial records.
  C: This is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: This is irrelevant to the argument.
  E: This weakens the argument because it suggests that the accountants may have had easier access to the internal financial records than the actuaries.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of XYZ Corporation's two actuaries because an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: If the actuaries were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants, this would weaken the detective's argument, as it would make it less likely that the embezzlement was carried out by one of the actuaries.
  B: If there is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records, this would weaken the detective's argument, as it would introduce the possibility that an outsider, not an employee, committed the crime.
  C: The fact that XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants and only two actuaries does not weaken the detective's argument, as the detective did not argue that the embezzler must necessarily be an actuary; only that an accountant was unlikely to have made the mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  D: If an independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, this does not weaken the detective's argument, as it does not mean that an accountant, rather than an actuary, committed the embezzlement.
  E: If certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, this would not weaken the detective's argument, as the detective was not arguing that an actuary had an easier time embezzling than would an accountant. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries because an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: This weakens the detective's argument since it suggests that accountants had closer supervision than actuaries, making it less likely for an accountant to embezzle without being caught.
  B: This weakens the detective's argument by providing an alternative explanation for how someone could gain access to internal financial records without being an actuary or an accountant.
  C: This could potentially weaken the detective's argument by suggesting that it is less likely that one of the two actuaries is the embezzler compared to one of the eight accountants. However, since the detective's argument only refers to the relative likelihood of an actuary versus an accountant being the embezzler, this does not necessarily weaken the argument.
  D: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that the company was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, which makes it less likely that an actuary is responsible for the embezzlement.
  E: This weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that it would be more difficult for an actuary, rather than an accountant, to have access to internal financial records.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.
  B: I have no reason to think that the practical joke I want to play would harm anyone. So, since the joke would show no contempt for the person the joke is played on, it would not be wrong for me to play it.
  C: Because of the circumstances, it would be wrong for me to play the practical joke I had intended to play on you. Even though it would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring you significant harm.
  D: It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone.
  E: Someone was harmed as a result of my practical joke. Thus, even though it did not show contempt for the person I played the joke on, I should not have played it.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The principle stated above establishes two conditions that, if met, make it unjustifiable to play a practical joke on someone: (1) the joke shows contempt for that person, or (2) the person playing the joke believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
A: This argument acknowledges that the principle applies to practical jokes that may bring significant harm to someone, even if they are not contemptuous. Therefore, it is consistent with the principle.
B: This argument assumes that the absence of contempt and significant harm are sufficient to make playing the joke justifiable, without considering the principle stated above.
C: This argument acknowledges that the principle does not require contempt for someone to make playing the joke unjustifiable, but it also recognizes that the potential for significant harm makes it unjustifiable.
D: This argument asserts that contempt is sufficient to make playing the joke unjustifiable, without considering the potential for significant harm. Therefore, it does not take into account the principle stated above.
E: This argument recognizes that the principle may apply even if the practical joke does not show contempt for the person, but it does not justify playing the joke if it brings harm to that person.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The principle is that one should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
A: In this argument, the person acknowledges that playing the practical joke could bring significant harm to someone and, therefore, knows that it is wrong to do so. This argument aligns with the principle stated.
B: This argument suggests that since the practical joke would show no contempt for the person, it would not be wrong to play it. However, the principle does not state that practical jokes are only wrong if they show contempt for the person; the principle includes the possibility of causing significant harm.
C: In this argument, the person acknowledges that the practical joke could easily bring significant harm to the person. This argument aligns with the principle stated.
D: In this argument, the person acknowledges that the practical joke would show contempt for someone, but it is unclear whether the person acknowledges that it might bring significant harm. Therefore, this argument does not align entirely with the principle stated.
E: This argument suggests that someone was harmed as a result of the practical joke. Although the person acknowledges that it did not show contempt for the person, the principle is that one should not play a practical joke if it shows contempt for the person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person. Therefore, this argument does not align entirely with the principle stated.

Choices:
  A: This option might explain why a movie might be more profitable than a TV show, but it doesn't explain why the primary goals of movie executives and television executives differ. 
  B: This option discusses the difference in the profits made from selling refreshments in movie theaters, but it doesn't help to explain why the primary goals of movie executives and television executives differ. 
  C: This option might help to explain why the costs of making movies and TV shows differ, but it does not explain why the primary goals of movie executives and television executives differ. 
  D: This option helps to explain the difference in the goals of movie executives and television executives. If the goal of television executives is to appeal to sponsors, rather than viewers, the number of viewers may not be the primary concern in producing a TV show.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Movie executives aim to maximize the number of people who see a film, as a film can only make a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows, but it may be influenced by the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

  B: This does not explain the difference in goals.
  C: This could be a possible explanation because the average cost of producing a film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television. So, the goal of movie executives is to ensure that they get the maximum revenue from ticket sales, whereas the goal of television executives is to maximize the profits from sponsors. However, this is not the best answer choice.
  D: This statement provides a possible explanation for the difference in goals because television shows make their profits from sponsors, who may be concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. Therefore, the goal of television executives may be to attract viewers with the purchasing power that their sponsors value.

Choice Analysis:
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the difference between the goals of movie executives and television executives. 
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the difference between the goals of movie executives and television executives.
  C: This statement could help explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and television executives because if the cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the cost of producing an hour of television, it is more costly to produce a movie than a TV show, so movie executives must ensure that the movie makes enough money to cover those costs.
  D: This statement does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and television executives. It explains how television shows make their profits.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the difference between the goals of movie executives and television executives.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  
A: This statement talks about the willingness of people to see a film more than once in comparison to watching a television show more than once, but it does not explain why movie and television executives have different goals. Therefore, this option is not relevant to determine why movie and television executives have different goals.

B: This option suggests that the difference between the profitability of theaters and television is a reason movie and television executives have different goals. However, the statement "There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers" is not a convincing explanation of why the primary goals of movie and television executives differ.

C: This option provides a possible reason why movie production may be more costly than television production, but it doesn't explain why movie executives focus on maximizing the number of people who see a film, while television executives do not have this goal.

D: This seems to be a plausible explanation for the different goals of movie and television executives. If television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, it makes sense that television executives would focus on attracting a specific demographic of viewers that align with their sponsors' interests. Movie executives, on the other hand, do not have this concern, as the profits of a movie are generated solely through ticket sales.

E: This statement provides information about the popularity of TV shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch, but it does not provide a sufficient explanation of why movie and television executives have different goals.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film because a film only makes a profit if the number of audiences generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it.
  It is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once. However, this does not explain the difference in goals.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers. This is irrelevant to the difference in goals.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television. The cost of producing films could be a factor that leads to the difference in goals.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This could help to explain the difference in goals.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch. This is irrelevant to the difference in goals.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
- These works are either on loan from private collectors or part of the museum's permanent collection.
- Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
- The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
 
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The curator does not say anything about whether or not every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the permanent collection. We only know that prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store, which means that prints of works that are on loan to the museum and prints of works that are part of the permanent collection are available. We also know that the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, so it is possible that not every print in the store is of a work that is on loan to the museum or part of the permanent collection. However, we do know that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, and the curator specifically mentions that prints of all of the works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the store. Therefore, every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The principles state that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: Riley unknowingly parked his car in the center lane of Main Street, and it did not occur to him that it could lead to a traffic accident. This situation seems to fit the principle, so Riley should not be blamed for any traffic accident that results from his parking.
B: The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it. Oblicek had no idea that suggesting a loan to her brother would cause his business to go bankrupt, and she could not have reasonably foreseen it, so Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
C: The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it if the person could reasonably have foreseen it. Gougon was concerned that serving hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, so he should be blamed for it if they do get ill.
D: The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it. Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know that the wrong medicine would cause the patient's increased blood pressure, so he should not be blamed for it.
E: The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it if the person could reasonably have foreseen it. Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which any reasonable person could have foreseen would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp should be blamed for starting the fire.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The principle states that a person should not be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if they could not reasonably have foreseen it.  
A: Riley parked his car in the center lane of Main Street, which could lead to a traffic accident. Although he should have realized it, it did not occur to him. Thus, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car, he should not be blamed for it.
B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. Thus, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it. This scenario is not covered by the given principle.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, which he did not know would cause a greatly increased blood pressure. Thus, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which any reasonable person could have foreseen would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there. This scenario goes against the given principle.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The passage argues that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: Riley knowingly parked his car in the center lane of Main Street despite realizing it could lead to a traffic accident. Thus, this reasoning does not fit with the principles outlined in the passage.
B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. Thus, this reasoning fits with the principles outlined in the passage.
C: Gougon was concerned that his hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, indicating he could have reasonably foreseen the possibility of food illness. Thus, this reasoning does not fit with the principles outlined in the passage.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know his actions would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure, indicating he could not have reasonably foreseen this. Thus, this reasoning fits with the principles outlined in the passage.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves even though any reasonable person could have foreseen that it could cause a fire. Thus, this reasoning does not fit with the principles outlined in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The principle mentioned in the context is that a person who unknowingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if they could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. If a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, and Riley could not have reasonably foreseen the accident, then he should not be blamed for it. This follows the above-mentioned principle.
B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. If the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, and Oblicek could not have reasonably foreseen the bankruptcy, then she should not be blamed for it. This follows the above-mentioned principle.
C: Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, but he had no reason to think that it would make his guests ill. If the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, and Gougon could not have reasonably foreseen the illness, then he may not be entirely to blame for it, but he may share some of the blame for not taking enough precautions. This does not follow the above-mentioned principle.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine and did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. If no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, and Dr. Fitzpatrick could not have reasonably foreseen the increase, then he may not be entirely to blame for the patient's misfortune, but he may share some of the blame for not taking enough precautions. This does not follow the above-mentioned principle.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves and started a fire on Rodriguez's farm. Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. If Kapp could have reasonably foreseen that her actions might start a fire, then she should be blamed for starting the fire. This does not follow the above-mentioned principle.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  A: Riley parked his car in the center lane of the road, which shows negligence on his part. He should have foreseen that parking a car in the center lane of the road could lead to a traffic accident. Therefore, he cannot justify his actions based on the principle discussed in the passage. 
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting a loan to her brother could cause the business to go bankrupt, and she could not have reasonably foreseen it. This situation matches the principle mentioned in the passage.
  C: Gougon was aware that a hollandaise sauce could make his guests ill, which shows negligence on his part. So, he cannot justify his actions based on the principle discussed in the passage.
  D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave the wrong medicine to his patient, and it caused the patient's condition to deteriorate. In this case, he could not have foreseen the consequences of his actions, which matches the principle discussed in the passage.
  E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, and anyone could have foreseen the possible consequences of her actions. Therefore, she cannot justify her actions based on the principle discussed in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The principles stated suggest that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if they could not have reasonably foreseen it.
  A: Riley knowingly parked his car in the center lane of Main Street, so it does not fit the criteria of unwittingly bringing about misfortune.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting a loan to expand the business would lead to bankruptcy, and this does fit the criteria of unwittingly bringing about misfortune in a situation that could not have been reasonably foreseen.
  C: Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce could make the guests ill, which suggests that he had reason to think that it could happen, and it does not fit the criteria of unwittingly bringing about misfortune that could not have been reasonably foreseen.
  D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave the patient the wrong medicine without realizing it would cause an increase in blood pressure, which fits the criteria of unwittingly bringing about misfortune that could not have been reasonably foreseen.
  E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves which any reasonable person could have foreseen would start a fire, so it does not fit the criteria of unwittingly bringing about misfortune that could not have been reasonably foreseen.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The question describes a set of principles that deal with the question of blame for unwittingly bringing about misfortune.
  A: The example given involves a person who could have foreseen the misfortune but did not put any thought into it.
  B: The example given involves a person who had no idea that their action would cause the misfortune and could not have reasonably foreseen it.
  C: The example given involves a person who had no reason to think that their action would cause the misfortune but was concerned that it might.
  D: The example given involves a person who did not know that their action would cause the misfortune, but no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to it.
  E: The example given involves a person who could have reasonably foreseen the misfortune but did not realize the potential danger of their actions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: Riley was unwittingly parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, but he could have foreseen a traffic accident resulting from it. Therefore, he is not exempted from the blame.
B: Oblicek was unwittingly suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan, and she could not have foreseen that it would cause the business to go bankrupt. This justifies her reasoning and exempts her from being blamed.
C: Although Gougon was not sure that serving the hollandaise sauce would not make his guests ill, he had no reason to think it would. So, he is not exempted from the blame.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick was unwittingly giving his patient the wrong medicine and could not have foreseen that it would cause the patient to experience increased blood pressure. Therefore, he is not exempted from the blame.
E: Although Kapp did not realize that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire, any reasonable person could have foreseen it. Therefore, she is not exempted from the blame.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage explains that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it, if they could not have reasonably foreseen the misfortune occurring.
A: The situation described does not meet the condition that the person who caused the misfortune did not realize it could occur. As the passage explains, a person who could have foreseen the consequences of their actions should be blamed for the misfortune that results.
B: This scenario fits the condition outlined in the passage. Oblicek had no idea that her suggestion would result in bankruptcy and could not have reasonably foreseen this outcome.
C: This scenario does not meet the condition that the person who caused the misfortune did not realize it could occur. Although Gougon had no reason to believe the dish would make his guests ill, he was still concerned it might. Therefore, he could have foreseen the potential consequences of serving the dish.
D: This scenario does not fit the condition outlined in the passage. As a medical professional, Dr. Fitzpatrick should be reasonably expected to understand the potential consequences of prescribing the wrong medication.
E: This scenario also does not meet the condition outlined in the passage. Dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves is a clearly foreseeable risk, and any reasonable person should understand the potential consequences.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses when a person can or cannot be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune. 
- The passage suggests that a person cannot be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
Choice B is the only option that fits the principle discussed in the passage. The passage suggests that a person should not be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it. Choice B describes a situation in which Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. Therefore, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it. This reasoning follows the principle outlined in the passage.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that juries are not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because jurors without specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from trials dealing with such issues.
  A: This option supports the argument.
  B: This option weakens the argument by stating that the more a juror knows about a scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins. This means that excluding those with specialized knowledge may actually lead to a more impartial jury.
  C: This option does not relate to the argument at all, so it cannot weaken the argument.
  D: This option does not weaken the argument, as the argument is not about the reliability of expert testimony. 
  E: This option does not relate to the argument, so it cannot weaken the argument.

Knowledge: The argument is that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries, making trials involving scientific or technical issues unfair. 
A: This choice supports the argument, saying that jurors without specialized knowledge may not understand the testimony. 
B: This choice weakens the argument, saying that jurors with specialized knowledge are more likely to be biased instead of being impartial. 
C: This choice is irrelevant, as it talks about arbitration instead of jury trials. 
D: This choice is also irrelevant, as it talks about how experts give testimony instead of the jury selection process. 
E: This choice is also irrelevant, as it talks about the cost of expert witnesses instead of the jury selection process.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that people who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant, which makes the trial not fair.
  A: This statement supports the argument, as it reinforces the idea that jurors without specialized knowledge might not be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: This statement weakens the argument, as it presents the possibility that jurors with specialized knowledge can be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it proposes an alternative dispute resolution method.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about the behavior of expert witnesses, not the exclusion of jurors with specialized knowledge.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about the cost of expert witnesses, not the exclusion of jurors with specialized knowledge.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that if people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant, then trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.

A: This choice supports the argument that people without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony given. It does not weaken the argument.

B: This choice claims that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced in favor of one party, which undermines the argument that the exclusion of jurors with specialized knowledge leads to unfair trials. Therefore, this choice weakens the argument.

C: This choice is discussing the fairness of appointing an impartial arbitrator which is not relevant to the argument. Therefore, it is not a valid option.

D: This choice does not relate to the argument being presented, so it is not valid.

E: This choice is discussing the affordability of expert witnesses in specialized fields which is not relevant to the argument.  Therefore, it is not a valid option.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument states that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because jurors without specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant.

A: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that jurors without specialized knowledge may be inadequate in comprehending the testimony; it does not weaken the argument.
B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument and therefore does not support or weaken it.
C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument and therefore does not support or weaken it.
D: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument and therefore does not support or weaken it.
E: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that parties may not be able to afford expert witnesses and therefore the exclusion of jurors with specialized knowledge may be a necessary compromise.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because specialized jurors are often excluded.
  A: This statement supports the argument by saying that jurors without specialized knowledge will have difficulty comprehending the testimony.
  B: This statement undermines the argument by suggesting that jurors with specialized knowledge may have a bias, which could make their verdicts less fair.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument because it discusses a different method of settling disputes.

A: This statement supports the argument that juries are not likely to understand complicated scientific or technical issues, therefore, it does not weaken the argument.
B: This statement suggests that people with knowledge might be biased and could further decrease the fairness of the trial, therefore, it does not weaken the argument.
C: This statement proposes an alternate solution, but it does not address the issue that the argument presents, therefore, it does not weaken the argument.
D: This statement suggests that experts may not be certain about their conclusions and could be questioned during the trial, thus, it weakens the argument.
E: This statement talks about the high costs of expert witnesses, but it does not address the issue that the argument presents, therefore, it does not weaken the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument suggests that trials by jury are not fair for cases involving scientific or technical knowledge due to the exclusion of those with specialized knowledge.
A: This strengthens the argument by suggesting that it is difficult for jurors without specialized knowledge to comprehend testimony on complicated issues. 
B: This also strengthens the argument by suggesting that jurors with specialized knowledge may be biased. 
C: This is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide evidence either for or against the use of juries. 
D: This weakens the argument by suggesting that experts acknowledge the possibility of error, which would make their testimony less biased.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The geologist's argument is that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals
- The argument against this view is that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
- The presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates the past or present existence of a living organism and supports the geologist's view.

A: This weakens the argument that all fossils contain biomarkers, but it does not refute the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
B: This is irrelevant to the argument about the formation of petroleum from living or non-living material.
C: This supports the argument that petroleum did not form from living material, but it does not refute the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
D: This also supports the argument that petroleum did not form from living material, but it does not refute the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
E: This weakens the argument against the view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals, as it provides evidence that carbon deposits can come from living organisms.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals, because of the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: This answer choice does not weaken the geologist's argument; it is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This answer choice does not weaken the geologist's argument; it is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This answer choice is consistent with the geologist's argument, and therefore does not weaken it.
  D: This answer choice actually supports the alternative theory for the formation of petroleum, and therefore strengthens, rather than weakens, the argument against the geologist's position.
  E: This answer choice weakens the geologist's position by providing an alternative source of carbon deposits that could have formed petroleum.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals and is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument about petroleum formation as it only suggests the existence of fossils without biomarkers.

E: The city leader does not make this claim. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The city leader's argument is that the amount of money tourists spend in the city will increase with the adoption of the new tourism plan, which will create more jobs compared to building an automobile manufacturing plant. The leader suggests that the tourism plan is less expensive than trying to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant in the city.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The city leader argues that adopting the new tourism plan would be a reasonable choice for the city because it would create jobs and cost less than trying to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant in the city. Therefore, the statement provides the most support for the claim that it would be reasonable for the city to adopt the new tourism plan. Choice A is incorrect because the argument does not suggest that the city should always implement the least expensive job creation measures. Choice B is incorrect because the argument only suggests that it would be reasonable for the city to spend the amount of money necessary to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant in the city if doing so creates as many jobs as the tourism plan would. Choice C is incorrect because the leader's argument is that adopting the tourism plan would cost less than trying to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant in the city. Choice E is incorrect because the argument does not suggest that tourism is the only way the city can create jobs.

  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This is a flawed way of reasoning, because the same conclusion cannot be drawn from the premise.
A: This argument is flawed because the premise does not support the conclusion. These are two separate claims. 
B: This argument is flawed because the premise is not a sufficient reason to justify the conclusion.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes a causation without providing enough evidence.
E: This argument is flawed because it takes a correlation and infers causation without enough evidence.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The student is making an assumption that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This is flawed reasoning because a person not developing harmful symptoms after exposure to a microorganism does not necessarily mean that they have immunity to that microorganism.
  A: This argument is an example of valid reasoning and cannot be compared to the flawed reasoning in the student's argument.
  B: The flawed reasoning in this argument is different from the student's argument, and cannot be compared.
  C: This argument is an example of flawed reasoning, but it is not similar in pattern to the student's argument.
  D: This argument has a similar pattern of flawed reasoning to the student's argument, as it assumes that a correlation between two factors (excessive taxation and decline in business expansions) is the result of causation.
  E: This argument is flawed reasoning and makes an assumption, but it is not similar in pattern to the student's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The student's argument assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that people have an immunity. This assumption is flawed because not all exposures to a microorganism will lead to infection, even without an immunity. 
A: This argument makes use of the fallacy of equivocation - using a word with more than one meaning in a single argument.  
B: This argument makes use of a flawed analogy by comparing the actions of advertisers to the actions of fiction writers. 
C: This argument makes use of a false dichotomy - suggesting that medication can only cure diseases or alleviate their symptoms, which is not always true. 
D: This argument makes use of the fallacy of correlation and causation - assuming that a decline in business expansions is directly caused by excessive taxation.  
E: This argument makes use of the fallacy of hasty generalization - generalizing the behavior of doctors to all health care professionals. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument presented by the student claims that since many people are exposed to Staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they must have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  A: This argument is about morality, not immunity to microorganisms.
  B: This argument is about persuasion in advertising, not immunity to microorganisms.
  C: This argument concludes that Isabel did not take the medication since it did not cure her disease or alleviate her symptoms. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning known as "denying the antecedent".
  D: This argument concludes that business owners' taxes are too high since their willingness to expand has decreased. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning known as "confusing cause and effect".
  E: This argument concludes that hand washing cannot prevent disease since doctors tend to wash their hands less often. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning known as "hasty generalization".
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The student argues that if someone doesn't have harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then that person is immune to infection by the microorganism.
  A: The argument is about morality and interests and does not have a similar pattern of reasoning.
  B: This argument is about trying to persuade people about claims and has nothing to do with immunity to microorganisms or the symptoms they cause.
  C: The argument is flawed because it assumes that taking medication will either cure the disease or alleviate its symptoms, and Isabel is still sick.
  D: This argument is about business expansions and taxes, and has nothing to do with immunity to microorganisms or the symptoms they cause.
  E: The argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors washing their hands less often than any other health care professionals implies that hand washing cannot prevent disease.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The student's argument is based on the idea that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then that person has immunity to that microorganism. However, this is not always true, because some people may be asymptomatic carriers, which means they can spread the microorganism to others without getting sick themselves.
  A: This argument is flawed because it equates moral rightness with actions that serve everyone's interests, which is not necessarily true.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures or alleviates symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely caused by excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors are the only people who can effectively prevent disease by washing their hands, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, then they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This reasoning is flawed because some people may be carriers of the microorganism without actually being immune to it. Being a carrier of Staphylococcus means that an individual can spread the bacteria to others without showing any signs or symptoms of an infection. Therefore, just because someone is exposed to staphylococcus without showing any signs of an infection does not mean that they are immune to it because they could be carriers of the bacteria.
A: This argument talks about morality and interests, and it is unrelated to the student’s argument.
B: This argument talks about advertisers and writers of fiction, and it is unrelated to the student’s argument.
C: This argument talks about Isabel and medication. It is flawed because there are many reasons why Isabel could still be ill besides not taking medication. Also, the fact that someone says they will take a medication does not mean that they will actually do it. This argument is different from the student's argument.
D: This argument talks about business owners and taxation, and it is unrelated to the student’s argument.
E: This argument talks about doctors and handwashing. It is flawed because handwashing is still the most effective way to prevent the spread of infection. This argument is unrelated to the student's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The student has used a type of faulty syllogism known as affirming the consequent. 
  In affirming the consequent, one begins by assuming that a certain condition implies another, and then argues that since the second condition holds, the first must also hold.
  This type of reasoning is flawed because there may be other reasons why the second condition holds; the second condition could be explained by a variety of factors, and not simply by the first.
  A: This argument has a different structure and does not share the same pattern of flawed reasoning as the student's argument.
  B: This argument has a different structure and does not share the same pattern of flawed reasoning as the student's argument.
  C: This argument has a different structure and does not share the same pattern of flawed reasoning as the student's argument.
  D: This argument has a different structure and does not share the same pattern of flawed reasoning as the student's argument.
  E: This argument has a different structure and does not share the same pattern of flawed reasoning as the student's argument.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The student's argument is that if a person is not affected by a microorganism, they must have immunity to that microorganism. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because there may be other reasons for not developing harmful symptoms, including that the microorganism is not harmful in their particular case.
A: This argument shows a flawed pattern of reasoning in which a necessary condition is mistaken for a sufficient one.
B: This argument doesn't show a flawed pattern of reasoning.
C: This argument doesn't show a flawed pattern of reasoning.
D: This argument doesn't show a flawed pattern of reasoning.
E: This argument doesn't show a flawed pattern of reasoning similar to the student's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. However, this argument is flawed because not all of the people who are exposed to staphylococcus actually have an immunity to it.
  A: This argument presents a flaw in reasoning that is unrelated to the student's argument.
  B: This argument presents a flaw in reasoning that is unrelated to the student's argument.
  C: This argument presents a flaw in reasoning that is unrelated to the student's argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The journalist argues that the critique of the book's claims about drug's side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims. The reason given is that the physician who criticized the book is employed by the company that manufactures the drug, which creates a conflict of interest and probably leads to denial of the drug's dangerous side effects.
A: This criticism is not relevant to the journalist's argument, as it deals with other claims made in the book, not the one in question.
B: This answer suggests that the journalist's argument is based on a sweeping generalization, but it's not true since the journalist's argument is based on the specific case of the physician who is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
C: This criticism is not relevant to the journalist's argument, as it shifts the focus to the author's bias, rather than the conflict of interest of the physician who criticized the book.
D: This answer identifies a weakness in the journalist's argument. It suggests that someone with personal reasons to deny a claim may still provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim. Hence, the journalist's argument is not entirely convincing.
E: This criticism does not relate to the journalist's argument, since the argument does not address the author's bias but focuses on the conflict of interest of the physician who criticized the book.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The journalist claims that the critique of the book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects since the physician who criticized the book is employed by the company that manufactures the drug and thus has personal reasons to deny the drug's danger. 

A: The argument does not address any other claims made in the book.
B: The argument suggests that the physician who critiqued the book might be biased since he is employed by the manufacturer of the drug in question. This assumption is questionable as it relies on a generalization.
C: The argument does not address any biases of the author of the book. 
D: This choice presents a plausible criticism, as it is possible that someone with personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim. 
E: This choice is irrelevant to the journalist's argument. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The journalist claims that the physician's critique of the book is not legitimate as the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug. The journalist assumes that the physician's critique is biased and influenced by personal reasons to deny the drug's side effects. The argument overlooks other possibilities and fails to address them.

A: This answer choice introduces the possibility that the critique could have called into question other claims in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects. This is not a criticism of the journalist's argument as the argument was concerned only with the claim made in the book about the dangerous side effects of the drug. Hence this is not the correct answer.
  
B: This answer choice criticizes the journalist's argument for assuming that anyone associated with the company manufacturing the drug is biased and therefore cannot weigh evidence fairly. This is a valid criticism of the journalist's argument as it assumes a broad generalization about the physician's bias based solely on the physician's association with the drug company. Hence, this is the correct answer.

C: This answer choice introduces the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects. This is not a criticism of the journalist's argument as the argument was concerned with the legitimacy of the critique and not the personal biases of the author of the book. Hence this is not the correct answer.

D: This answer choice criticizes the journalist's argument for not considering the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim. This is not relevant to the journalist's argument as the journalist is concerned only with the physician's critique and not with the possibility of someone else providing legitimate grounds. Hence this is not the correct answer.

E: This answer choice criticizes the journalist's argument for overlooking the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author. This is not a criticism of the journalist's argument as the argument was concerned only with the physician's critique and not with any other possibility. Hence this is not the correct answer.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The journalist argues that the physician's critique is not legitimate, as the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug and thus has personal reasons to deny the drug is dangerous.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the journalist.
  B: The journalist does suggest that the physician's association with the company may have influenced their critique, but does not necessarily take for granted that all such individuals are unable to weigh evidence fairly.
  C: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the journalist.
  D: This choice presents a possible criticism of the journalist's argument, but it is not the most vulnerable.
  E: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the journalist.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book claiming a drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claim because the physician criticizing the book is employed by the company that manufactures the drug, and hence may have personal reasons to deny the drug's dangerous side effects.
  A: This is not a vulnerability of the journalist's argument since the argument is only concerned with the critique's ability to refute the book's claim that the drug has dangerous side effects, not with other claims made in the book.
  B: This is a vulnerability of the journalist's argument since it assumes incorrectly that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to weigh evidence concerning the drug's side effects.
  C: This is not a vulnerability of the journalist's argument since the journalist is not concerned with the author's biases.
  D: This is not a vulnerability of the journalist's argument since the journalist is arguing that the personal biases of the physician cast doubt on the critique rather than providing legitimate grounds for rejecting the book's claim.
  E: This is not a vulnerability of the journalist's argument since the argument is not concerned with whether there may be other reasons why a critique may fail to provide legitimate grounds for rejecting a claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The journalist argues that a critique of a book claiming that a drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claim because the physician who provided the critique is employed by the company that manufactures the drug. The journalist assumes that the physician is biased and unable to fairly weigh evidence about the drug's side effects. 
A: This is not relevant to the journalist's argument. The argument only concerns the critique of the book's claim about the drug's side effects.
B: This is a potential criticism of the journalist's argument. The argument assumes that the physician is biased simply because they are employed by the company that manufactures the drug. This may not be a fair assumption to make.
C: This is not relevant to the journalist's argument. The journalist assumes that the physician is biased, not the author of the book.
D: This is not a criticism of the journalist's argument. The journalist argues that even if the physician provides legitimate grounds for denying the book's claim, their employment by the company makes their critique suspect.
E: This is not a criticism of the journalist's argument. The argument concerns the role of personal biases in the critique of the book's claim.
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist argues that the physician's critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects, because the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
A: This choice is not a criticism of the journalist's argument, it introduces a new possibility.
B: This choice challenges the journalist's assumption that the physician's employment by the company makes him biased, which is the basis of the journalist's argument.
C: This choice is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
D: This choice is not a criticism of the journalist's argument, it introduces a new possibility.
E: This choice is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist's argument states that the physician who criticized the book probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous, and therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.

  B: This choice criticizes the journalist's argument for taking for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug. This is a valid criticism and makes the argument vulnerable.
  C: This choice presents an alternative possibility about the author's bias, but it is not relevant to the journalist's argument as the argument is only concerned with the physician's bias.
  D: This choice criticizes the journalist's argument for failing to address the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim, which is not relevant to the argument as the argument is only concerned with the physician's bias.
  E: This choice presents an alternative possibility, but it is not relevant to the journalist's argument as the argument is only concerned with the physician's bias.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The study found that among office workers who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control. 
A: The explanation in this option does not provide any reason to explain the study's findings, as it talks about office workers who have the most control over their own work tending to do significantly less typing.
B: This option is a plausible explanation because it provides a reason for why lack of control could increase susceptibility to nerve disorders.
C: This option provides a different reason for the development of carpal tunnel syndrome and does not explain the study's findings about how lack of control over work increases the risk of the disorder.
D: This option is not relevant to the study's findings about the relationship between the amount of control over work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome among office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
E: This option provides a different explanation for the development of carpal tunnel syndrome and does not explain the study's findings about how lack of control over work increases the risk of the disorder.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The study found that office workers who had the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome than did those who had the most control among those who did similar amounts of typing.
A: This option suggests that the reason for the findings might be that those with the most control type less. This does not explain why those with less control had a higher risk, given they all did similar amounts of typing.
B: This option offers a plausible explanation in which emotional stress is linked to carpal tunnel syndrome susceptibility among those reporting less control over their work.
C: This option provides an alternative explanation than the control notion for carpal tunnel syndrome development and is not relevant to the workers' control level. 
D: This option does not explain the study's findings because it does not differentiate between control levels as it mentions "rarely use keyboards."
E: This option offers another plausible explanation that those with more control over their work tend to perform other tasks and hence less typing, which could be the reason that they are less prone to carpal tunnel syndrome.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The study found a correlation between the amount of control over work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome among workers who do similar amounts of typing. The study did not provide a causal relationship between control over work and carpal tunnel syndrome. 
A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the study's findings. 
B: This answer would make sense but it is not mentioned in the study. 
C: This answer choice is irrelevant to the study's findings. 
D: This answer choice is irrelevant to the study's findings and only provides information about non-typing workers. 
E: This answer choice suggests another factor could be responsible for the study's results. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Choices:
  A: This choice does not help to explain why workers with the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did workers who reported the most control.
  B: This choice gives a possible explanation that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This would explain why workers with the least control had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  C: This choice gives a possible explanation that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This explanation would not explain the study's findings that workers with the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did workers who reported the most control.
  D: This choice talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards, but the study is about office workers who do similar amounts of typing. So, this choice is not relevant to explain the study's findings.
  E: This choice talks about office workers who perform repetitive motions other than typing. However, the study is focused only on office workers who do similar amounts of typing. Therefore, this choice does not help to explain the study's findings.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  A: This option talks about the number of hours spent typing and does not explain the relationship between carpal tunnel syndrome and control over work.
  B: This option offers a plausible explanation to the relationship between carpal tunnel syndrome and control over work, but it is not supported by the study's findings.
  C: This option suggests a direct cause of carpal tunnel syndrome, but it does not explain why the incidence of the disorder was three times higher among workers who reported the least control over their own work.
  D: This option talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards, which is not relevant to the study in question. 
  E: This option suggests that office workers who have high control over their work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often, which could explain why they have a smaller likelihood of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  A recent study found that office workers who reported the least control over their work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome compared to those who reported the most control over their work.
  Carpal tunnel syndrome is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard.
Choices:
  A: This choice suggests that office workers with the most control over their work do significantly less typing than those with the least control, which does not directly explain the study's findings about carpal tunnel syndrome.
  B: This choice suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts a person under emotional stress that makes them more susceptible to nerve disorders. This offers a possible explanation for the study's findings that office workers with the least control over their work had higher rates of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  C: This choice suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type put their arms and hands in positions that promote carpal tunnel syndrome. While this information may be true, it does not directly explain the study's findings.
  D: This choice suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel they lack control over their own work. However, this information does not address the findings of the study that focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  E: This choice suggests that office workers with the most control over their own work perform other types of repetitive motions more often than those with less control over their work. This does not directly explain the study's findings.

  B: This choice suggests a link between emotional stress and the risk of nerve disorders but does not link emotional stress to control over one's own work. 
  C: This choice suggests a possible direct cause of carpal tunnel syndrome; however, it does not explain the study's finding on the link between control over one's own work and the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This choice is about office workers who rarely use keyboards and is not relevant to the study's findings on carpal tunnel syndrome and typing.
  E: This choice is about repetitive motions other than typing and does not address the study's findings on the link between control over one's own work and the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The study found that among office workers who do similar amounts of typing, those who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  
A: This information does not help to explain the study's findings as it is about office workers who have the most control over their own work tending to do significantly less typing than those who have the least control over their own work.
  
B: This answer choice provides a plausible explanation for the study's findings. If feeling a lack of control over one's work puts them under emotional stress, they become more susceptible to nerve disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome.

C: This information provides a possible reason why office workers may develop carpal tunnel syndrome, but it does not explain why those who report the least control over their work have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as those who report the most control.

D: This information is not relevant to the study's findings as it pertains to office workers who rarely use keyboards.

E: This information does not help to explain the study's findings as it is about office workers who have the most control over their own work tending to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than those who have the least control over their own work.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- A study found that for office workers who do similar amounts of typing, those who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
- The study is focused on workers who do similar amounts of typing.
- The study does not provide any statistical evidence about the relationship between the amount of typing and carpal tunnel syndrome.
- The study does not suggest any causal link between typing and carpal tunnel syndrome but suggests that lack of control over one's work can increase the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.

Reasoning:
- The question stem asks us to identify an option that "most helps to explain the study's findings."
- Among the given options, option B provides a plausible explanation as to how the lack of control over one's work could increase the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  A: This choice is irrelevant to the study's findings. It does not help to explain the relationship between control over one's work and carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument in the context has the following pattern of reasoning: 
  - Wells, knowledgeable about concerts, thought the concert would sell out unless poorly promoted.
  - The concert did not sell out
  - Therefore, the concert was probably poorly promoted.
A: The pattern of reasoning in choice A is: 
  - Dr. Smith, a cardiologist, thought the patient would probably survive IF the surgery was performed by a skilled surgeon.
  - The patient did not survive the surgery
  - Therefore, the surgery was probably not performed by a skilled surgeon.
B: The pattern of reasoning in choice B is:
  - Professor Willis, knowledgeable about organic chemistry, thought the sample probably did not contain organic compounds.
  - A sample without organic compounds should be labeled differently.
  - Therefore, the sample probably has the wrong label.
C: The pattern of reasoning in choice C is:
  - The neighbor, experienced in home renovation, thought the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if repaired properly.
  - The damage is still noticeable.
  - Therefore, the repair was probably not done properly.

  - The builder said the roof would require repairs only if damaged in a storm.
  - The roof is already leaking
  - Therefore, the builder was probably wrong.
E: The pattern of reasoning in choice E is:
  - The Professor, who is an expert on the subject, thought the tests would find lead in the soil if properly conducted.
  - The tests did find lead in the soil.
  - Therefore, the tests were probably conducted properly.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The argument presents a claim made by Wells, an expert in the concert business, that a poorly promoted concert would not sell out. The argument then concludes that because the concert did not sell out, it was probably not properly promoted.

A: The argument presents a claim made by Dr. Smith, an expert in cardiology, that a heart transplant would probably be successful if performed by a highly skilled surgeon. The argument then concludes that because the patient did not survive the surgery, it was probably not properly performed. This is a similar pattern of reasoning to the argument in the prompt.

B: The argument presents a claim made by Professor Willis, an expert in organic chemistry, that a sample probably does not contain organic compounds. The argument then concludes that the sample is probably labeled incorrectly, since if it were labeled correctly, it would contain organic compounds. This is not a similar pattern of reasoning to the argument in the prompt.

C: The argument presents a claim made by the neighbor, an experienced home renovator, that damage to a wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. The argument then concludes that because one can still notice the damage, the repair to the wall was probably not properly done. This is a similar pattern of reasoning to the argument in the prompt.

D: The argument presents a claim made by a builder that a school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The argument then concludes that because the roof is already leaking and there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong. This is not a similar pattern of reasoning to the argument in the prompt.

E: The argument presents a claim made by Professor Yanakita, an expert on the subject, that tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. The argument then concludes that since the tests did find lead in the soil, they were probably properly conducted. This is not a similar pattern of reasoning to the argument in the prompt.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument discusses a situation where an expert predicted an outcome, but the opposite outcome occurred. The expert believed that the event would happen unless some specific factor interfered.
A: The pattern of reasoning is similar, as an expert provides a prediction about an event, and the opposite outcome occurs. However, unlike in the original argument, there is a specific condition for success (the surgery must be performed by a highly skilled surgeon).
B: This argument is not similar, as there is no expert opinion on a specific condition for success, nor is there a prediction that was proven false.
C: This argument is not similar, as there is no expert opinion on a specific condition for success, nor is there a prediction that was proven false.
D: This argument is not similar, as there is no expert opinion on a specific condition for success, nor is there a prediction that was proven false.
E: This argument is not similar, as the expert's prediction was proven true rather than false.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning where the conclusion is that the concert was not probably properly promoted because it did not sell out, despite Wells' knowledge in the concert business.
A: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning where the conclusion is drawn from the premise that Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would likely survive the heart transplant if it was performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, it concludes that the surgery was probably not properly performed because the patient did not survive the surgery.
B: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning where the conclusion is drawn from the premise that Professor Willis, an expert in organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain organic compounds. Thus, it concludes that the sample is not labeled correctly because if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
C: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning where the conclusion is drawn from the premise that the speaker's neighbor, an experienced home renovator, said that the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, it concludes that the repair to the wall probably was not properly done because one can still notice the damage.
D: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning where the conclusion is drawn from the premise that the builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it's damaged in a storm. But the roof is already leaking, and there have been no major storms. Thus, it concludes that the builder was probably wrong.
E: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning where the conclusion is drawn from the premise that Professor Yanakita, an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. And the tests did find lead in the soil. Therefore, it concludes that the tests were probably conducted properly.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning that involves predicting a certain outcome given certain conditions, and then concluding that the opposite condition must have obtained because the predicted outcome did NOT occur.
  A: The argument is similar in that it involves predicting a certain outcome given certain conditions, and then concluding that the opposite condition must have obtained because the predicted outcome did NOT occur.
  B: The argument is not similar because it argues that something is mislabeled based on the opinion of an expert, rather than predicting an outcome and then concluding the opposite condition must have obtained because the predicted outcome did NOT occur.
  C: The argument is not similar because it argues that something was not done properly based on the opinion of an expert, rather than predicting an outcome and then concluding the opposite condition must have obtained because the predicted outcome did NOT occur.
  D: The argument is not similar because it involves predicting a certain outcome given certain conditions, but then concludes that something is wrong with the prediction, rather than concluding that the opposite condition must have obtained because the predicted outcome did NOT occur.
  E: The argument is not similar because it presents a pattern of reasoning that involves predicting a certain outcome given certain conditions, and then concluding that the predicted outcome DID occur, based on the evidence presented.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person (Wells) makes a prediction (the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted), and then concludes that the prediction was wrong because the event did not happen as expected (the concert did not sell out). 

A: The argument presents a knowledgeable person (Dr. Smith) who makes a prediction (the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon), and then concludes that the prediction was wrong because the event did not happen as expected (the patient did not survive the surgery). This argument presents a similar pattern of reasoning as that in the initial argument.
B: The argument presents a knowledgeable person (Professor Willis) who makes a prediction (the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds), but the conclusion drawn from that prediction does not match the pattern of reasoning presented in the initial argument.
C: The argument presents a knowledgeable person (the neighbor) who makes a prediction (the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired), but the conclusion drawn from that prediction does not match the pattern of reasoning presented in the initial argument.
D: The argument presents a builder who makes a prediction (the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm), but the conclusion drawn from that prediction does not match the pattern of reasoning presented in the initial argument.
E: The argument presents a knowledgeable person (Professor Yanakita) who makes a prediction (the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted), but the conclusion drawn from that prediction does not match the pattern of reasoning presented in the initial argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for Kodiak bears because of the shape of their hip and foot bones. 
  A: This is not a vulnerability of the argument because the argument is not based on a few observed bears, but on the physical characteristics of the Kodiak's hip and foot bones. 
  B: This is a possible vulnerability of the argument; it is possible that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity. However, the argument is not vulnerable to this criticism because it does not claim that walking on hind legs is only an innate capacity. It only claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and natural behavior for Kodiak bears.
  C: The argument does not change the meaning of the word "behavior" during the course of the argument. This is a straw man fallacy and is not a vulnerability of the argument.
  D: The argument does not presume that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways. This is a straw man fallacy and is not a vulnerability of the argument.
  E: The argument does not appeal to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion. It is based on empirical evidence about the physical characteristics of the Kodiak's hip and foot bones.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is natural behavior for Kodiak bears based on the shape of their hip and foot bones. 
  A: The argument does not provide evidence of generalization to all Kodiak bears.
  B: The argument does not address the possibility of both learning and innate capacity.
  C: The argument does not change the meaning of the word "behavior".
  D: The argument does not make such a presumption.
  E: The argument does not rely on the authority of science, but on the evidence of the bears' hip and foot bones.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that walking on hind legs is natural for Kodiak bears, based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  A: The argument does not generalize from the behavior of a few bears, it provides a scientific argument based on the bears' physical characteristics.
  B: The argument explicitly states that walking on hind legs is innate. It does not address the possibility of learning as a contributing factor.
  C: The argument uses the word "behavior" consistently to refer to the bears' walking on hind legs.
  D: The argument does not make any presumptions about how behavior can be explained. It only provides a specific argument about Kodiak bears.
  E: The argument does not appeal to the authority of science, but rather uses scientific evidence to support its claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive for Kodiak bears based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  A: The argument does not generalize from the behavior of a few bears, but rather it argues from the physical characteristics of the species.
  B: The argument does not necessarily exclude the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity. However, it argues that the capacity for walking on hind legs is innate for Kodiak bears.
  C: The argument does not change the meaning of the word "behavior" during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument does not presume that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways. It only argues for the instinctive nature of walking on hind legs in Kodiak bears.
  E: The argument does not appeal to the authority of science. It only appeals to scientific evidence to support its claim about the instinctive nature of walking on hind legs in Kodiak bears.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument suggests that Kodiak bears' ability to walk upright is not a learned behavior, but an instinctive one due to their hip and foot bone make-up.
A: The argument does not commit the fallacy of over-generalization. It presents an argument that the behavior of walking on hind legs is a natural behavior of the Kodiak bears due to their bone structure.
B: This criticism is not applicable since the argument suggests that walking on hind legs is an innate behavior.
C: There is no indication or evidence in the argument that suggests a change in the meaning of the word "behavior".
D: The argument does not assume that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways. It simply suggests that the behavior of walking on hind legs of Kodiak bears is instinctive and not learned.
E: The argument does not appeal to the authority of science as it only presents a scientific finding as supporting evidence for its claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument is based on the idea that the Kodiak bear's anatomy makes it natural for them to stand and walk on hind legs, and therefore it is instinctive and not learned behavior.
A: The argument does not generalize; it is based on specific information about the Kodiak bear's anatomy.
B: The argument acknowledges that the behavior may be a combination of both innate capacity and learning, but it is focused on the innate capacity aspect.
C: The term "behavior" is used consistently throughout the argument, so this criticism is not applicable.
D: The argument does not presume that all behavior can be explained in only two ways; it is focused specifically on the behavior of the Kodiak bear.
E: The argument is not appealing to any specific authority, but rather presenting a scientific finding about the Kodiak bear's anatomy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the Kodiak bear's ability to walk upright is completely natural and instinctive, rather than a learned behavior.
  A: This criticism attacks the argument's use of a few examples to generalize a conclusion. However, the argument does not rely on few examples to support the conclusion.
  B: This criticism suggests that the Kodiak bear might have learned to walk on hind legs. However, the argument specifically claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behaviour.
  C: This criticism claims that the argument uses the term "behavior" differently in different parts of the argument. However, the argument only uses the term "behavior" once and consistently.
  D: This criticism suggests that the argument assumes there are only two ways to explain behavior. However, the argument does not suggest that there are only two ways to explain behavior.
  E: This criticism claims that the argument relies on the authority of science instead of providing evidence. However, the argument presents a scientific finding as evidence to support the claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear because of the shape of its hip and foot bones.
  A: The argument talks about the Kodiak bear, not just a few individual bears.
  B: The possibility of walking on hind legs being both a learned and innate behavior is not relevant to the argument.
  C: The term "behavior" has a consistent meaning throughout the argument.
  D: The argument does not claim that all behavior can be explained in only one or two ways.
  E: The argument does not appeal to the authority of science inappropriately. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that the Kodiak bear walks on hind legs because of its natural behavior and not as a learned behavior.
A: This is not the case as the argument is based on Kodiak bears in general and not a few instances.
B: This seems like a plausible criticism as the argument doesn't consider the idea that walking on hind legs might be the result of both learning and instinct.
C: The argument doesn't make such a change in meaning. 
D: The argument doesn't make such a presumption. 
E: The argument doesn't seem to make an appeal to any scientific authority.
Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In marketing their products, drug companies often send gifts to physicians. According to a recent survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Question: If the survey results are accurate, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts.
  B: Most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians.
  C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  D: Some physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts.
  E: All physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  
A: There is no information to support this claim.
B: There is no information to support this claim.
C: This is a possible conclusion based on the survey results.
D: This is a possible conclusion based on the survey results.
E: This is not a necessary conclusion based on the survey results. The survey does not indicate that all physicians who admit that their own choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  
A: This choice is not necessarily true based on the information given in the survey. The survey does not provide a comparison between physicians who accept gifts from drug companies and those who do not.
  
B: The survey does not indicate whether most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians or not. We cannot determine the accuracy of this statement based on information given in the survey. 

C: This choice may be true based on the information given in the survey. If some physicians are mistaken about the degree to which they and other physicians are influenced by gifts from drug companies, this could explain the discrepancy between physicians' beliefs about their own choices and those of other physicians.

D: This choice may be true based on the information given in the survey. If some physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts, this would support the findings of the survey.
  
E: This choice is not necessarily true based on the information given in the survey. The survey finds that most physicians believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by gifts from drug companies, but it does not indicate whether all physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by such gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: If most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts and yet believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts, it suggests that some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer. (A) is out of scope. (B) is not supported by the information given. (D) is irrelevant as it discusses a comparison of beliefs about different degrees of influence. (E) goes beyond what is supported by the survey results.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Choices:
  A: The survey does not provide information that directly supports this statement. It is possible, but not necessarily true.
  B: The survey result does not imply anything about what physicians think drug companies should do. This statement is irrelevant.
  C: This statement is consistent with the survey result. It suggests that some physicians may have a mistaken perception about the influence of gifts from drug companies.
  D: This statement is consistent with the survey result. It suggests that some physicians may believe that other physicians are more influenced by gifts from drug companies than they themselves are.
  E: This statement goes beyond what the survey results support. The survey indicates that most physicians believe other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by gifts from drug companies, but it does not suggest that all physicians who are influenced by these gifts believe the same.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  According to the survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. However, the same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Choices:
  A: The survey does not provide information to determine whether physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts. This option goes beyond the scope of the survey.
  B: The survey does not provide information about whether most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians. This option goes beyond the scope of the survey.
  C: This is a possible inference that can be drawn from the survey results. If most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but at the same time they believe most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts, then some physicians are mistaken about either their own influence or the influence on other physicians.
  D: This option is the opposite of what the survey indicates. The survey states that physicians believe their own choices are not influenced by gifts but other physician's choices are influenced by gifts. Therefore, it is not likely that physicians believe other physician's choices are influenced more than their own.
  E: The survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. Therefore, not all physicians admit that their own choices are influenced by such gifts. Option E makes an extreme claim that all physicians who admit that their own choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts which is not necessarily true. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The survey conducted shows that:
  - most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts
  - the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.

A: The survey does not provide any evidence to support this statement. It cannot be concluded whether physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies prescribe unnecessary drugs less than those who do.
B: The survey does not indicate anything about what most physicians believe about new guidelines that regulate drug companies' practices in sending gifts to physicians.
C: This statement is true based on the information provided in the survey. It is possible for some physicians to be influenced by gift items from drug companies while still believing that they are not influenced. Additionally, it is possible for some physicians to believe that other physicians are influenced by such gifts more than they actually are.
D: The survey does not provide any evidence to support this statement. It cannot be concluded whether some physicians believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by gifts from drug companies than their own choices.
E: The survey only indicates that most physicians believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts, but it does not provide any evidence to support that all physicians who admit they are influenced by gifts believe the same about others.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The survey results show that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Choices:
  A: The survey results do not provide information about whether physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs.
  B: The survey results do not express the belief of physicians about new guidelines for drug companies' practices in sending gifts to physicians.
  C: Given that the survey shows a majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by gifts from drug companies, this choice could be true. It is plausible that some physicians are mistaken about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies, or the impact of such gifts on their peers.
  D: This choice is plausible based on the survey results. If a physician admits that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts, this would suggest that such gifts can influence prescription choices. Furthermore, if these physicians believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts, then this would show that they believe such gifts can be influential for other physicians as well.
  E: The survey results show that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts. This choice is a generalization that goes beyond the survey results. The survey results only indicate that there is a difference between how physicians perceive their own choices vs. how they perceive other physicians' choices. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  According to the survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
 
A: This statement is not necessarily true based on the information provided in the context.

B: The survey does not provide information on whether or not physicians believe drug companies should adopt new guidelines.
C: This could be a possible explanation for the survey results, but it is not a required conclusion.
D: This statement can be inferred from the information in the survey.
E: This statement goes beyond what is provided in the survey.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The majority of physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Choices:
  A: There is no direct correlation established between physicians accepting gifts and prescribing unnecessary drugs. 
  B: The passage does not suggest that most physicians have an opinion on regulatory guidelines regarding the gifts from drug companies.
  C: The passage suggests that physicians who think they are not influenced are mistaken about the degree of influence, not that they are mistaken about whether or not gifts lead to influence.
  D: The passage suggests that physicians who admit they are influenced by gifts believe that other physicians are also influenced by gifts.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presented is that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is also required. Without intellectual discipline, thinkers would not be able to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  A: This answer is irrelevant to the conclusion drawn by the professor, and it does not relate to intellectual discipline.
  B: This answer is also irrelevant to the conclusion, and it does not relate to intellectual discipline.
  C: This is the opposite of the conclusion drawn by the professor. The argument is that freedom of thought does not necessarily lead to intellectual discipline.
  D: This statement is not related to the conclusion drawn by the professor about the relationship between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline.
  E: This statement supports the argument presented by the professor, as it emphasizes the importance of intellectual discipline.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The professor argues that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress and that intellectual discipline is needed. Therefore, the conclusion drawn by the professor would follow logically if it is assumed that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.
Choices:
  A: This statement is not relevant to the conclusion drawn by the professor.
  B: This statement describes a condition but is not sufficient to support the professor's conclusion that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress.
  C: This statement contradicts the conclusion drawn by the professor and is therefore not relevant.
  D: This statement supports the importance of freedom of thought but does not address the professor's argument that intellectual discipline is also necessary for intellectual progress.
  E: This statement supports the professor's argument that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress, as it suggests that without intellectual discipline there can be no freedom of thought, which is necessary for intellectual progress.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The professor argues that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress and that intellectual discipline is necessary for exploring the full implications of interrelated ideas. 
  A: This statement could support the idea that freedom of thought is necessary for intellectual progress, but it is not relevant to the professor's argument about the need for intellectual discipline.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the professor's argument about the need for intellectual discipline.
  C: This statement contradicts the professor's argument that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is necessary.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the professor's argument about the need for intellectual discipline.
  E: This statement supports the professor's argument that intellectual discipline is necessary for freedom of thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The argument is that while freedom of thought is important, intellectual discipline is also necessary for true intellectual progress.
- The professor concludes that the argument for freedom of thought fails because it does not take into account the importance of intellectual discipline.

Action: Answer(C) 
If thinkers who have freedom of thought necessarily lack intellectual discipline, then the argument for freedom of thought fails and the professor's conclusion logically follows.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument is that freedom of thought on its own is not enough to make intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is also necessary. Therefore, the assumption or key point required to draw this conclusion logically should state that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.

A: The premise that thinkers who limit their line of thought are hindered in their intellectual progress is not related to the conclusion of the argument.
B: This statement may be true but it does not support the conclusion that the argument reaches.
C: This statement is not related to the conclusion of the argument.
D: While this statement may be true, it does not support the conclusion of the argument.
E: This supports the conclusion of the argument that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The argument suggests that freedom of thought without intellectual discipline does not lead to intellectual progress. Intellectual discipline is needed to explore and uncover the full implications of interrelated ideas.

A: This choice supports the argument but it is not necessary to assume it for the conclusion to follow.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument about the relationship between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline.
C: This choice contradicts the argument that the failure of the argument for freedom of thought is due to the lack of intellectual discipline.
D: This choice is outside the scope of the argument and it does not address the relationship between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline.
E: This choice closely aligns with the argument that intellectual discipline is needed for freedom of thought to lead to intellectual progress, which is the conclusion drawn by the professor.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The professor argues against the idea that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, stating that intellectual discipline is also necessary for making progress in a certain direction. The argument suggests that a balance between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline is necessary for making intellectual progress.
A: This choice does not necessarily lead to the conclusion drawn by the professor.
B: The argument does not imply that intellectual progress is possible only in a society that values intellectual progress.
C: The argument does not suggest that freedom of thought and intellectual discipline are mutually exclusive.
D: This choice contradicts the argument made by the professor.
E: This choice supports the conclusion of the argument made by the professor. A balance between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline is necessary for making intellectual progress.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that freedom of thought alone is not enough for intellectual progress and is insufficient without intellectual discipline.
  
A: This statement is not enough to support the professor's conclusion because the argument is not about limiting line of thought to orthodoxy.
B: This statement is not related to the argument presented by the professor.
C: This statement is not true and contradicts the argument made by the professor.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument explains that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from browsing high-growing vegetation by raising its neck. 
  Computer models showed that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level, allowing it to feed on underwater vegetation from dry land. 
  Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. 
A: The argument does not require this assumption in order to establish its conclusion. 
B: The argument does not mention anything about the ability of Diplodocus to see in front of itself. 
C: The argument does not mention anything about the blood supply to an elevated brain or its impact. 
D: The argument does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation. 
E: This assumption is required by the argument since it rules out the possibility of Diplodocus browsing for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument states that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented raising its neck to browse on high-growing vegetation and that its neck could bend downwards to access underwater vegetation from dry land. The conclusion is that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: The argument does not require this assumption as it is not relevant to the argument.
B: This information is not mentioned in the argument and is therefore not relevant to the argument.
C: The argument does not require this assumption as blood supply to the brain is not mentioned in the argument.
D: The argument does not require this assumption as it is not relevant to the argument. The argument only talks about the mechanism by which Diplodocus accessed vegetation, not other ways it could have accessed them.
E: This assumption is required by the argument because if Diplodocus were able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then the argument's conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater would be weakened.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about how the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the movement required for browsing on high-growing vegetation.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Diplodocus's neck structure would not have allowed it to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its neck due to the structure of its neck bones, but that it could bend downwards and even extend below ground to feed on underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: The argument does not require this assumption, as it does not make any claims about modern ground-feeding animals and their neck structures.
B: The argument does not make any claims about Diplodocus's vision abilities, so this assumption is not required.
C: The argument does not address Diplodocus's brain or the blood supply to it, so this assumption is not required.
D: This assumption is not required, as the argument already proposes an alternative way for Diplodocus to access vegetation from underwater.
E: This assumption is required, as the argument specifically states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but does not mention any other possible methods for accessing underwater vegetation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument states that computer models suggest that Diplodocus fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater, as it was not possible to raise its long neck high enough to access treetop leaves. 

A: The argument makes no assumption about the neck structure of modern ground-feeding animals. This is not relevant to the argument about Diplodocus's feeding habits.
B: The argument makes no mention of Diplodocus's vision. This is not relevant to the argument about Diplodocus's feeding habits.
C: The argument does not concern blood circulation to the brain of Diplodocus. This is not relevant to the argument about Diplodocus's feeding habits.
D: The argument suggests an alternative way in which Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation, so it does not assume that there was no other way for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation.
E: The argument does not address the possibility of Diplodocus browsing for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a new theory about Diplodocus's feeding habits, based on the limitations of its neck structure.
  A: The argument does not require any knowledge of the neck structures of modern animals.
  B: The argument mentions nothing about Diplodocus's field of view.
  C: The argument says nothing about Diplodocus's brain or blood supply.
  D: This choice is the opposite of the argument's claim, and is therefore incorrect.
  E: This choice is a possibility that is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about Diplodocus and its feeding behavior, which the computer models suggest would have been on or near the ground or underwater due to the structure of its neck bones. 
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument; it does not matter if the same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals or not.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument; it does not matter if Diplodocus was able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward or not.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument; it does not matter if it would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain or not.
  D: This statement is relevant to the argument because it presents a possible alternative method for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation that is not considered in the argument.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument; it does not matter if Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them or not.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from browsing for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its neck. However, its neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.

A: The argument doesn't mention anything about modern ground-feeding animals, so this assumption is not required.
B: The argument doesn't mention anything about the visibility of Diplodocus, so this assumption is not required.
C: The argument doesn't mention anything about the blood supply to Diplodocus's brain, so this assumption is not required.
D: The argument implies that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, so this assumption is not required.
E: The argument implies that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it doesn't mention anything about kneeling beside bodies of water or walking into them, so this assumption is not required.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument is about how the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have limited its ability to raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, and that the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, which would have allowed Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.

A: The argument doesn't require any knowledge about modern ground-feeding animals, so this assumption is not required by the argument.
B: Seeing in front of itself is not relevant to the argument, so this assumption is not required by the argument.
C: The argument doesn't make any claims about the ability of Diplodocus to supply blood to its brain, so this assumption is not required by the argument.
D: The argument suggests that Diplodocus had another way of accessing high-growing vegetation (underwater), so this assumption is not required by the argument.
E: This assumption is required by the argument. If Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then it would have had another way of accessing high-growing vegetation besides raising its neck.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented movement that was previously believed, such as raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but would have allowed bending down and even extending below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground or underwater.
  A: The argument does not require this assumption and it is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The argument does not imply that Diplodocus had difficulty seeing in front of itself or that it required a steep angle of the neck to see.
  C: The argument does not make any statement regarding the blood supply to Diplodocus's brain, so this assumption is not necessary.
  D: The argument does not state that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation and thus this assumption is not required.
  E: This assumption is relevant to the argument as it suggests that browsing for underwater vegetation in a way other than bending down or walking into bodies of water is not a possibility for Diplodocus.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses a flawed sample as evidence to support its conclusion. The fact that the author only knows people who voted against the proposal does not mean that most people voted against it. The author needs to consider a more representative sample of the population before making such a claim.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
  
The argument is flawed because it relies on a small and biased sample of people in drawing the conclusion that the official results were rigged. The fact that everyone the person knows voted against the proposal does not mean that most people in the population did so as well. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge:
  The speaker assumes that everyone he/she knows constitutes a representative sample of the general population.
  Choice A describes this flaw by pointing out that the evidence used is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  Choice B describes circular reasoning, where the speaker presumes the truth of the conclusion that he/she sets out to prove.
  Choice C describes an ad hominem fallacy, where the speaker attacks the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  Choice D describes a distinction that the speaker failed to make between how people should have voted and how they actually voted, which is not relevant to this argument.
  Choice E describes an argument that defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it, which is not relevant to this argument.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: The argument uses a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population, based on the fact that the author claims that "everyone" they know voted against the proposal, which is not a representative sample. This suggests that many people outside of the author's social circle may have voted differently and that their votes were likely included in the 80 percent in favor of the proposal.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument presented is that since everyone the person knows voted against the proposal, therefore, it must be rigged because the official results showed the opposite. The flaw in this argument is that the sample (everyone the person knows) may not be representative of the general population. Therefore, it is incorrect to assume that everyone in the country must have voted the same way as the people they know. Thus, the best answer choice is A.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses evidence drawn from a limited sample (people known to the speaker) and applies that evidence to the general population. This sample is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Therefore, the argument commits the fallacy of "hasty generalization."
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument uses the evidence drawn from a small sample, which is unable to determine the larger population's view. The argument overlooks the possibility that the people the speaker knows might not represent a diverse set of people. Therefore, the conclusion that most people voted against the proposal based on the speaker's circle contradicts the official election results. The correct answer choice describes this fallacy is A, as the sample that the speaker uses is not representative of the general population.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument assumes that a small sample of people the person knows is representative of the general population.
  A: The argument is not using evidence from a sample that is unlikely to be representative. 
  B: The argument is not presuming the truth of the conclusion it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument is not attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: This is a possible flaw in the argument as it assumes that everyone the person knows voted against the proposal and that is evidence that most people voted against it.
  E: The argument is not defending a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")  
Flaw in the reasoning: 
  The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The fact that "everyone I know voted against the proposal" is a biased sample and does not necessarily generalize to the rest of the population. The official results, on the other hand, suggest that a large majority of the population voted in favor of the proposal.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is flawed because it relies on a small and biased sample to discredit the official results of the national referendum. The fact that "everyone I know" voted against the proposal is likely not representative of the general population and cannot be used to draw any valid conclusions about the outcome of the referendum. This is a classic example of selection bias, where the sample is not representative of the population. Option A correctly describes the flaw in the reasoning of the argument. Option B describes circular reasoning; Option C describes an ad hominem attack; Option D describes a distinction without a difference; and Option E describes an argumentum ad populum fallacy.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Inez: The book we are reading, The Nature of Matter, is mistitled. A title should summarize the content of the whole book, but nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy. Antonio: I do not think that the author erred; according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the conversation above?
Choices:
  A: Inez believes that the book should be called The Nature of Energy.
  B: Antonio believes that there are no differences between matter and energy.
  C: Inez and Antonio disagree on whether matter and energy are related.
  D: Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book.
  E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

In the conversation, Inez believes that the book's title should summarize the content of the whole book, and half of the book is devoted to discussing energy which is closely related to matter. Antonio disagrees with Inez and thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Therefore, the most strongly supported option is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. So, the correct answer is E.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: Inez believes that the book title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of the whole book since nearly half of the book discusses a different, albeit closely related, subject: energy. On the other hand, Antonio disagrees with Inez's belief about the book's title. He thinks that the author did not err because according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Analysis: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy since the book's content discusses both topics. Hence, option E is the most strongly supported by the conversation above. 

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez thinks that the book's title is misleading because it focuses on matter without including energy, which is also discussed.
  Antonio thinks that matter and energy are related and therefore it is alright to have a title that focuses on matter even if energy is also discussed.
  
Answer Explanation: 
  The conversation suggests that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. This is the opinion that is most strongly supported by the conversation. None of the other options are mentioned or implied in the conversation.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez thinks that the book's title is mistitled because nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing a different subject, energy.
  Antonio thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
  
Reasoning:
  Option A is incorrect because although Inez thinks that nearly half of the book discusses energy, she does not explicitly state that the book should be called The Nature of Energy.
  Option B is incorrect because Antonio did not say that there are no differences between matter and energy; he merely stated that they are two facets of the same phenomenon.
  Option C is incorrect because Inez and Antonio are in agreement that matter and energy are closely related.
  Option D is incorrect because there is no indication in the conversation that Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
The conversation above suggests that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez believes the book's title is mistitled as it does not reflect the content of the book.
  Nearly half of the book is devoted to energy, which Inez believes should be reflected in the title.
  Antonio believes that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Inference:
  Inez thinks that if the book is titled "The Nature of Matter", it should also reflect the content about energy in the title. 
  Antonio believes that matter and energy are closely related, but he does not necessarily state that they are the same thing.
  
Answering using POE:
Option A is incorrect because it only states Inez's belief partially.
Option B is incorrect because it misrepresents Antonio's statement.
Option C is incorrect because it misinterprets the context.
Option D is incorrect because the overall value of the book is not discussed.
Option E is strongly supported by the conversation, as Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Thus, the correct answer is E.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez thinks that the book title is mistitled because it does not include energy which comprises nearly half of the book. 
  Antonio disagrees with Inez and thinks that matter and energy are one and the same thing, so it does not matter if the title mainly focuses on matter. 

Analysis: 
  Antonio's opinion does not really address the title of the book. He instead points out the relationship between matter and energy. 
  Inez believes that the title should not mention matter without mentioning energy, which is supported by her argument that the book is mistitled.
  Choice A is too extreme because Inez did not suggest a new title for the book. 
  Choice B was not mentioned by Antonio in the conversation.
  Choice C is incorrect because both Inez and Antonio agree that matter and energy are related. 
  Choice D is not supported by the conversation as they did not discuss the overall value of the book.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
Inez believes that the book title is wrongly focused on one subject and should not be titled after it. Antonio thinks that the author did not err. Therefore, they do not disagree on whether matter and energy are related. Rather, they are discussing whether the title should reflect the equal importance of both subjects. Choice A is too extreme because Inez does not suggest changing the entire title. Choice B is not supported by the conversation. Choice C is incorrect as mentioned earlier. Choice D is not supported by the conversation. Choice E is the best representation of Inez's stance.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

According to the conversation, Inez argues that the book is mistitled because it does not mention energy whereas nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing energy. Antonio disagrees with Inez and thinks that matter and energy are closely related. Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. This most closely aligns with choice E.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez claims that the book title is mistitled because it does not summarize the content of nearly half of the book, which is dedicated to discussing energy, a closely related subject to matter. 
  Antonio disagrees with Inez and thinks that the author did not make an error because modern physics describes matter and energy as two facets of the same phenomenon.

Analysis:
  Inez and Antonio both agree that matter and energy are related. Inez argues that the book title should not mention matter without mentioning energy because a significant part of the book is dedicated to discussing energy. Antonio thinks that the author did not make an error because modern physics describes matter and energy as two facets of the same phenomenon.

Therefore, the most strongly supported statement by the conversation above is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez believes that the book's title is mistitled and that nearly half of the book is devoted to discussing a closely related subject: energy. 
  Antonio disagrees with Inez and thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.

Reasoning: 
  From the conversation above, Inez does not suggest that the book should be called "The Nature of Energy." She believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Antonio disagrees with Inez and believes that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Therefore, "E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy" is most strongly supported by the conversation above.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychologist: The obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously. However much society may have changed over the centuries, human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction. Thus, the important social function of positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can be served only if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the psychologist's argument by the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously?
Choices:
  A: It is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion.
  B: It is used to counter a consideration that might be taken to undermine the argument's conclusion.
  C: It is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
  D: It is used to identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned.
  E: It is the conclusion that the argument is intended to support.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The psychologist's argument is centered around the idea that expressing gratitude cannot be done anonymously if it is to fulfill its social function of positively reinforcing beneficial behavior. The psychologist believes that human psychology is still primarily driven by personal interaction and therefore the benefactor must know the source of gratitude in order for it to be effective. 
A: The claim is not used to illustrate a premise in support of the conclusion, but rather is a key point in the psychologist's argument. 
B: The claim is not used to counter a consideration that might undermine the argument's conclusion, but rather supports the argument's conclusion. 
C: The claim is used to directly support the claim that gratitude cannot be anonymous, which in turn supports the argument's conclusion. 
D: The claim does identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned, but it is not the only way the argument is supported. 
E: The claim is not the conclusion, but rather is used to support the conclusion. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The psychologist's argument claims that expressing gratitude is important for positively reinforcing behaviors that have beneficial consequences. The psychologist also claims that gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously because personal interaction is necessary for positive reinforcement.
A: This choice is incorrect because the claim is not used to illustrate a premise. It is an important premise itself.
B: This choice is incorrect because the claim is not used to counter a consideration that might undermine the argument's conclusion.
C: This choice is correct. The psychologist uses the claim to indirectly support the argument's conclusion by supporting the claim that positively reinforcing beneficial behaviors is important and can only be done through personal interaction.
D: This choice is incorrect because while the claim is related to a social benefit, it does not identify it.
E: This choice is incorrect because the claim is a premise, not a conclusion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: The psychologist's argument is that expressing gratitude is an important social function because it reinforces beneficial behaviors, but this function can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude. The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously plays a role in indirectly supporting this argument by suggesting that the personal interaction involved in expressing gratitude is necessary in order for the function to be served. It is not the main conclusion of the argument itself, nor does it counter a consideration or identify a social benefit.
Response 3:
Knowledge: The psychologist argues that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously and the reason behind that is human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction, so positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can be served only if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
A: A premise is a statement used to support the conclusion of an argument. The given description does not seem to illustrate the usage of a premise to support the argument's conclusion.
B: The given description does not explain how the claim counters a consideration that undermines the conclusion.
C: The given description seems to indicate that the claim is used to support the argument's conclusion, not to support any other claim.
D: The given description identifies the social benefit with which the argument is concerned, but it does not explain the role of the claim in the argument.
E: The given description contradicts the statement as the claim is not the conclusion but a premise in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The psychologist argues that expressing gratitude has an important social function of positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others, and this function can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude. The psychologist also claims that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously.
A: This choice is incorrect because the claim is not an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion.
B: This choice is incorrect because the claim is not used to counter a consideration that might be taken to undermine the argument's conclusion.
C: This choice is incorrect because the claim is not used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
D: This choice is incorrect because the claim does not identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned; it only supports the idea that knowing the source of the gratitude is necessary to fulfill the obligation to express gratitude.
Action: Answer("E") 
Response 5:
Knowledge: The psychologist argues that expressing gratitude is important, and that it cannot be fulfilled anonymously because personal interaction is an essential factor in human psychology. The psychologist claims that positively reinforcing behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can only be achieved if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
A: The claim is not used as an illustration of a premise.
B: The claim is not used to counter a consideration that might undermine the argument's conclusion.
C: This choice is close, but it suggests that the claim is indirectly used to support a claim that supports the conclusion. However, the argument does not make this distinction explicitly.
D: The claim is used to identify one of the social benefits that the argument is concerned with, but it is not the only benefit.
E: The claim is not the conclusion that the argument is trying to establish.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The psychologist argues that expressing gratitude cannot be done anonymously because personal interaction is necessary to positively reinforce behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others.
Choice analysis:
  A: The claim is not used to illustrate a premise, but to support the central argument.
  B: The claim is not used to counter a consideration that might undermine the conclusion.
  C: This accurately describes the role played by the claim. The psychologist uses the claim to indirectly support the argument's central claim that expressing gratitude cannot be done anonymously.
  D: The claim is used to identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned, but it is not the main role it plays.
  E: The claim is not the conclusion that the argument is intended to support.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The psychologist argues that expressing gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously and the beneficial consequences that gratitude brings can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude. 
A: The claim is not used as an illustration of a premise, but rather as one of the premises themselves.
B: The claim is not countering a consideration that might undermine the conclusion, but rather supports the premises and the conclusion.
C: The claim is not used indirectly to support another claim, but rather it is one of the premises that supports the conclusion directly.
D: The claim identifies the social benefit being discussed, but it is not the primary role it plays in the argument.
E: The claim is not the conclusion, but rather one of the premises that supports the conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The psychologist argues that expressing gratitude is an important social function that can only be effectively fulfilled if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude. Anonymously fulfilling this obligation would disregard the personal interaction that human psychology is driven by, making it difficult to reinforce beneficial behaviors.
  A: The claim is not used to illustrate a premise that supports the conclusion.
  B: The claim is not used to counter a consideration that might undermine the conclusion.
  C: This choice is the best answer. The claim is used indirectly to support the conclusion by establishing the importance of personal interaction in fulfilling social obligations, which is necessary to reinforce beneficial behaviors. 
  D: The claim does not identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned.
  E: The claim is not the conclusion of the argument. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The psychologist is making an argument that expressing gratitude is an important social function and cannot be fulfilled anonymously because human psychology relies on personal interaction. 
A: The claim is not used to illustrate a premise used to support the argument's conclusion.
B: The claim is not used to counter any consideration.
C: This choice seems plausible because the claim is indirectly supporting a claim that the argument uses to support its conclusion. However, it is not clear that the argument relies on an intermediate claim.
D: The claim is used to identify an important social benefit, but it is not the primary role it plays in the argument.
E: The claim is not the conclusion of the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. So, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine?
Choices:
  A: All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water.
  B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
  C: A washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine.
  D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
  E: Washers that use more water get clothes cleaner than those that use less.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers.
  Ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.
  A: The amount of water used by top-loading washing machines is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement provides additional information but it is not necessary for the argument.
  C: This statement is not necessary for the argument.
  D: This statement is required by the argument because it supports the claim that a detergent formulated for front-loading washers is needed to get clothes really clean in such machines.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the consumer magazine claims that using a laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is necessary to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, since ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.
  A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This answer choice is not necessary for the argument, as the argument only talks about the need for a laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, it does not compare the dissolvability of laundry detergents in front-loading and top-loading machines.
  C: This answer choice is too broad to be necessary for the argument. The argument is only talking about front-loading machines and the need for a detergent formulated for them.
  D: This answer choice matches the argument made in the consumer magazine, as it explains why a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed in order to get clothes really clean.
  E: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers, so a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine.
  A: The amount of water used by top-loading washing machines is not relevant to the argument in the consumer magazine.
  B: The argument is about the effectiveness of detergents in front-loading machines, not in top-loading machines.
  C: This statement is not required for the argument that specially formulated detergent is needed for front-loading machines.
  D: This statement is relevant to the argument in the consumer magazine: if the detergent does not dissolve readily, it will not get clothes really clean.
  E: The argument in the consumer magazine is based on the assumption that using less water does not necessarily mean that clothes will not get clean.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers because they use less water than top-loading washers, and that a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument, it talks about the comparison between front-loading and top-loading washers, while the argument focuses on the usage of the detergent formulated for front-loading washers.
  C: This statement goes beyond the scope of the argument, which focuses only on the use of the detergent.
  D: This statement is relevant to the argument since it asserts that the detergent must dissolve readily in the washer to get clothes really clean in it.
  E: This statement contradicts the argument, as the argument states that front-loading washers use less water and use a detergent specially formulated for them to wash clothes effectively.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers, and therefore, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers should be used.
  A: The argument does not depend on the amount of water used by top-loading washers.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument being made.
  C: This statement is not entirely necessary. It is not clear that a washing machine needs a special detergent, only that one that dissolves readily in the machine.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
Question: The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
  B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  C: My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house. Since anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it.
  D: My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Since no one who lives in a house both O'WIlS it and pays rent on it, it must be that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their heuse.
  E: Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Therefore, it must be that they pay rent on it.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a conditional statement "No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise". 
  And then it uses the fact that Lester has not received a raise, to conclude that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation. 
  A: The argument is different from this because it presents a negative premise followed by the conclusion that a particular thing cannot be true.
  B: The argument is different from this because it presents a positive premise followed by the conclusion that a particular thing cannot be true.
  C: The argument is different from this because it presents a premise of fact followed by a conclusion that a particular thing must be true.
  D: This argument is structurally the same as the given argument because it presents a negative premise followed by the conclusion that a particular thing must be true.
  E: This argument is different from the given argument because it presents a premise of fact followed by the conclusion that a particular thing must be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. The argument concludes that Lester has received a poor performance evaluation, since he has not received a raise.
  A: The argument talks about a house and its ownership/rental condition. The conclusion is drawn based on the fact that the neighbors pay rent, and since the rule states that one cannot both own and pay rent on a house, it must be that they do not own the house.
  B: The argument talks about a house and its ownership/rental condition. Here, the argument concludes that the neighbors are not paying rent, since the rule states that one cannot both own and pay rent on a house, and the neighbors are known to own their house.
  C: The argument talks about a house and its rental condition. The conclusion is drawn based on the fact that the neighbor has not paid any rent, and since the rule states that anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own the house.
  D: The argument talks about a house and its ownership/rental condition. The conclusion is drawn based on the fact that the neighbors do not own their house, and since the rule states that one cannot both own and pay rent on a house, it must be that they pay rent on their house.
  E: The argument talks about a house and its ownership/rental condition. The conclusion is drawn based on the fact that the neighbors do not own their house, and since the rule states that anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it, it must be that they pay rent on their house.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument uses the "inverse" of a conditional statement. That is, it assumes that if an event A occurs, then another event B must have occurred. The argument concludes that since B does NOT occur, then A must not have occurred. This is a mistaken assumption.
  A: This argument involves a similar flawed reasoning as the argument in the question.
  B: This argument involves the contrapositive of the conditional statement and is a valid argument.
  C: This argument involves the converse of the conditional statement and is a mistaken assumption.
  D: This argument involves the inverse of the conditional statement and is a mistaken assumption similar to the argument in the question.
  E: This argument involves the converse of the conditional statement and is a mistaken assumption.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument uses the logical structure of denying the consequent.
  A: This argument affirms the consequent, which is a flawed reasoning, but it has a different logical structure than the argument presented.
  B: This argument also affirms the consequent, which is a flawed reasoning. It has a similar logical structure, but it is not the same as the argument presented.
  C: This argument has a different logical structure than the argument presented.
  D: This argument uses the same logical structure of denying the consequent as the argument presented.
  E: This argument affirms the antecedent, which is a flawed reasoning, but it has a different logical structure than the argument presented.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the context makes the assumption that receiving a poor performance evaluation is the only explanation for not receiving a raise.
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that paying rent is the only explanation for not owning a house. 
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that owning a house is the only explanation for not paying rent on a house.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that owning a house is the only explanation for not paying rent on a house.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that paying rent is the only explanation for not owning a house.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that paying rent is the only explanation for not owning a house.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument takes the form of a conditional statement: If A (receiving both a poor performance evaluation and a raise), then B (not working at Leila's Electronics); the contrapositive is If not B (working at Leila's Electronics), then not A (not receiving both a poor performance evaluation and a raise).
  A: This argument takes the same form as the original argument: If A (owning a house), then not B (paying rent on it). The contrapositive is If B (paying rent on a house), then not A (not owning it). The first statement in the argument is the negation of the second statement in the contrapositive, so the argument is flawed.
  B: This argument is the contrapositive of the argument in A, so it is not parallel to the original argument.
  C: This argument is similar to the original argument: If A (not paying rent on a house), then B (owning it). The contrapositive is If not B (not owning a house), then not A (paying rent on it). The original argument is the negation of the second statement in the contrapositive, so the argument is flawed.
  D: This argument takes the same form as the original argument: If A (owning a house), then not B (paying rent on it). The contrapositive is If B (paying rent on a house), then not A (not owning it). The original argument is the negation of the second statement in the contrapositive, so the argument is flawed.
  E: This argument is the contrapositive of the argument in C, so it is not parallel to the original argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise and no one who works at Leila's has received both a poor evaluation and a raise. This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise.
  A: This argument is similar in structure, but it has a different subject matter. It concludes that the neighbors do not own their house because they pay rent, but there may be other reasons why they pay rent.
  B: This argument is similar in structure, but it has the opposite conclusion. It concludes that the neighbors do not pay rent because they own their house, but there may be other reasons why they do not pay rent.
  C: This argument concludes that the neighbors own their house because they have not paid rent, but there may be other reasons why they have not paid rent.
  D: This argument is similar in structure to the flawed reasoning in the original argument. It concludes that the neighbors pay rent because they do not own their house, but there may be other reasons why they do not own their house.
  E: This argument is similar in structure, but it has the opposite conclusion. It concludes that the neighbors pay rent because they do not own their house, but there may be other reasons why they pay rent.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument presents a conditional statement with a negative conjunction. It states that because Lester has not received a raise from Leila's Electronics, the only other possibility is that he received a poor performance evaluation.
A: The argument is similar because it presents a conditional statement with a negative conjunction. However, the conclusion is different, since it states that the neighbors do not own the house.
B: This argument is dissimilar because it presents an affirmative conjunction, not a negative one. The argument concludes that the neighbors do not pay rent.
C: This argument is dissimilar because it presents an affirmative conjunction, not a negative one. The argument concludes that the neighbors own the house.
D: The argument is similar because it presents a conditional statement with a negative conjunction. However, the conclusion is different, since it states that the neighbors pay rent on their house.
E: This argument is dissimilar because it presents an affirmative conjunction, not a negative one. The argument concludes that the neighbors pay rent.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the context commits the fallacy of "affirming the consequent" which is when a conclusion is drawn from a conditional premise by affirming the consequent instead of affirming the antecedent.
  A: The argument in option A is valid because it affirms the antecedent of the conditional premise.
  B: The argument in option B is also flawed because it commits the same fallacy as the argument in the context.
  C: The argument in option C is invalid because it affirms that the neighbor owns the house without evidence.
  D: The argument in option D is invalid because it affirms that the neighbor pays rent without evidence.
  E: The argument in option E is also invalid because it affirms that the neighbor pays rent without evidence.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is flawed because it assumes that receiving a raise and a poor performance evaluation are mutually exclusive, which may not be true.
  A: This argument is flawed because it assumes that owning a house and paying rent on it are mutually exclusive, which may not be true.
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that owning a house and paying rent on it are mutually exclusive, which may not be true.
  C: This argument is flawed as it assumes that anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it must own it, which may not be true.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that owning a house and paying rent on it are mutually exclusive, which may not be true.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that anyone who lives in a house but does not own it must pay rent on it, which may not be true.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: For a contract to be valid, the offer must be legitimate, and the offer must be accepted by the other party.
A: This argument correctly identifies that for a contract to be valid, an offer must be made and not rejected. But does not consider if the offer was legitimate.
B: This argument correctly identifies that, for a contract to be valid, an offer must be legitimate and the second party must accept the offer. It also considers the possibility that the offer was made in jest, which is the principle mentioned in the context, thus this is the correct answer.
C: This argument misinterprets the principle provided by assuming that if the offer is legitimate, then the contract will be valid. It also does not consider the acceptance of the offer by the other party.
D: This argument only considers whether the offer was made in jest, but it does not consider whether it is legitimate or accepted by the other party.
E: This argument does not address the legitimacy of the offer. Also, it states that the only offer made to Veronica was not legitimate, but it does not state whether Veronica accepted or rejected it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  For a contract between two parties to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  
A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract. - This statement is consistent with the principle, but does not justify any reasoning.
B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. - This statement uses the principle correctly to argue that the contract was not valid.
C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. - This statement assumes that Mindy being a reasonable person is sufficient to make the offer legitimate, and does not address the principle directly.
D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. - This statement uses the principle correctly to argue that a contract would be valid if Lea accepts the offer.
E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. - This statement is consistent with the principle, but does not justify any reasoning.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The principle stated above is talking about the legitimacy of an offer, which should not be considered as "in jest" by the party to whom the offer was made, in order for a contract to be valid.

A: The argument talks about an accepted offer and an absence of rejection, it does not consider the legitimacy of the offer. 

B: The argument considers a situation in which the offer was made "in jest", which violates the principle stated in the context. Therefore, this argument is in line with the principle and helps to justify its reasoning. 

C: The argument talks about an offer being legitimate, but it does not talk about a reasonable belief in its legitimacy by the party to whom the offer was made.

D: The argument talks about an offer being made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, which follows the principle stated in the context. Therefore, this argument is in line with the principle and helps to justify its reasoning.

E: The argument does not consider the legitimacy of the offer, it only mentions that the only offer made was not legitimate, which is an incomplete argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from another party. An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
A: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above, as it suggests that because Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy did not reject the offer, there was a valid contract.
B: This argument applies the principle in the reverse manner. Kenta accepted Gus's offer, but Gus made the offer in jest, which means that the offer was not legitimate and thus there was no valid contract.
C: This argument assumes that Mindy will accept the offer if it is legitimate, but it does not relate to the principle stated above.
D: This argument applies the principle correctly, stating that Hai's offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest and that a valid contract exists if Lea accepts the offer.
E: This argument does not relate to the principle stated above, as it only states that the only offer Sal made to Veronica was not legitimate.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other party. An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest. 

A: This argument is valid but only partially justifies the reasoning as it states the condition for a valid contract but does not clearly mention whether the offer was legitimate or not.
B: This argument is justifiable and is in line with the principle stated above. As Kenta was unaware that Gus made the offer in jest, the offer was not legitimate, and the contract was not valid.
C: This argument is not valid as it is based solely on assumptions and human behavior, without any concrete evidence.
D: This argument is justifiable as it is based on the principle stated above and mentions that the offer was made in such a way that no one would reasonably believe it to be made in jest.
E: This argument is not valid as it speaks about Sal and Veronica, but it does not give any information about whether the offer was legitimate or not. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  A: The argument is valid, but the principle stated does not help to justify it.
  B: The argument is based on the principle stated above. If Gus made the offer in jest and Kenta was not aware of it, then the offer is not legitimate, and the contract is not valid.
  C: The argument assumes that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate, but it does not help to justify it.
  D: The argument is based on the principle stated above. The offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, making the contract valid.
  E: The argument assumes that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one, however, the principle stated does not help to justify it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: A contract is only valid if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other and an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus made the offer a jest. This means that the offer was not legitimate. This is consistent with the principle stated above. Thus, the contract was not valid.
C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Whether Mindy is reasonable or not, this is not consistent with the principle stated above.
D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. If Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. This is consistent with the principle stated above.
E: Sal's only offer to Veronica was not legitimate. This is not consistent with the principle stated above. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

A: This argument is not relevant because it does not address whether someone would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
B: This argument is valid because it is consistent with the principle. Kenta accepted Gus's offer, but Gus made the offer in jest. According to the principle, the offer is not legitimate, and the contract is not valid.
C: This argument is not relevant because it does not address whether someone would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
D: This argument is valid because it is consistent with the principle. If Hai's offer was not made in jest and no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, then the contract between them would be valid if Lea accepts the offer.
E: This argument is not relevant because it does not address whether an offer was legitimate or not.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The principle stated above talks about the legitimacy of the offer, which means that someone in the position of the party to whom the offer was made would reasonably believe the offer to be serious in nature.
  A: The argument is based on whether Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy hasn't rejected it. It does not take into account if the offer was made in jest.
  B: The argument concerns an offer that was made in jest. Therefore, it is in line with the principle mentioned.
  C: The argument is based on the legitimacy of the offer made by Frank to Mindy, without taking into account if the offer was made in jest.
  D: The argument is similar to option A and concerns the legitimacy of the offer. It states that the offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. However, it leaves room for interpretation as to whether the offer was made legitimately or not. 
  E: The argument is about whether Sal made a legitimate offer to Veronica. It does not take into account if the offer was made in jest.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  A valid contract requires a legitimate offer from one party and acceptance from another party, and an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract. - This argument is generally valid, but the principle stated above is not explicitly used or referenced in this argument.

B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. - This argument is using the principle stated above, that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest. Therefore, accepting an offer made in jest would not create a valid contract.

C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. - This argument assumes that Frank's offer was legitimate, but it does not reference the principle stated above.

D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. - This argument uses the principle stated above, that an offer is legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would not reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest. Therefore, if Lea accepts the offer, they would have a valid contract.

E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. - This argument is generally valid, but the principle stated above is not explicitly used or referenced in this argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Horror stories can be divided into two kinds: those about mad scientists and those about monstrous beasts.
- Monster stories can symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
- Stories about mad scientists usually express the author's antiscientific views.
- Both types of horror stories must describe violations of the laws of nature.
- Both types of horror stories intend to produce dread in the reader.

Analysis:
- None of the options are exactly true based on given statements.
- Option A is incorrect because only horror stories about monstrous beasts are not all violating the laws of nature, while the other kinds of horror stories might not necessarily involve violations of the laws of nature.
- Option B is incorrect because while all stories described might be intended to invoke dread in the reader, it is not necessarily always the case.
- Option C is incorrect because not all horror stories involve psychologically disturbed characters.
- Option D is incorrect because not all stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
- Option E is incorrect because the given statements only said that "some" monster stories can symbolize psychological disturbance, they did not specify any relationship between symbolism and violations of the laws of nature.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher claims that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, based on the comparison between those who stretch before jogging and those who do not.
  
A: This choice seems to be irrelevant to the conclusion of the researcher's argument. It doesn't provide any information that weakens the researcher's argument.
B: This choice suggests that some people who have been previously injured may not be able to perform stretches, which might make the injury rate of the stretching group higher than the non-stretching group. Therefore, it might weaken the researcher's argument.
C: This choice suggests that most jogging injuries do not result from the causes that stretching can prevent, therefore it weakens the researcher's argument.
D: This choice provides additional information on the behavior of joggers, but it doesn't provide any information that would weaken the researcher's argument.
E: This choice provides information about the effects of stretching on certain forms of exercise, but it doesn't provide any information that would weaken the researcher's argument.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. The researcher compared joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to those who do not stretch, and found that both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
A: This statement does not directly contradict the medical researcher's argument, but instead provides additional context. However, it does suggest that the rate of injuries for both groups is lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries, which could indicate that stretching is beneficial.
B: This statement implies that those who were previously injured while jogging were not able to perform stretches, which suggests that stretching could be beneficial for injury prevention.
C: This statement is in line with the medical researcher's argument as it suggests that stretching would have little effect on injuries caused by falls, collisions, and other mishaps.
D: This statement suggests that those who are more prone to injuries are more likely to perform stretches before jogging, which could invalidate the comparison made by the medical researcher.
E: This statement suggests that stretching can be beneficial for certain exercises, which weakens the medical researcher's argument that stretching does not help prevent injuries during jogging.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. This conclusion is based on the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries despite one group habitually stretching before jogging and the other group not stretching.
A: This statement does not weaken the researcher's argument because if both groups had a lower injury rate than the overall rate of jogging injuries, then it means that stretching did not increase the injury rate of the stretching group.
B: This statement does not weaken the researcher's argument because it shows that some joggers experienced difficulty in performing stretches, but it does not address the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries.
C: This statement supports the researcher's argument, but we are looking for a statement that weakens the argument.
D: This statement weakens the researcher's argument because it suggests that the habit of performing stretches may be an indicator of injury-proneness, rather than being a cause of increased injuries.
E: This statement weakens the researcher's argument because it suggests that stretching can be beneficial in preventing injuries in certain forms of exercise.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument suggests that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  A: This statement seems to support rather than weaken the medical researcher's argument.
  B: If many previously injured joggers had difficulty performing stretches, then the effectiveness of stretching could have been underestimated. This could weaken the researcher's argument.
  C: If most jogging injuries cannot be prevented by stretching, then this could weaken the researcher's argument.
  D: If joggers prone to injuries always stretch before jogging, then stretching before jogging may not be the reason these joggers are more likely to develop injuries. This does not weaken the researcher's argument.
  E: This statement does not address the specific context of jogging injuries and stretching before jogging, so it is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, and this is based on the comparison of two groups of joggers who either stretch or not before jogging.
A: This statement does not directly affect the researcher's argument. It only provides additional information that the rate of jogging injuries was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
B: This weakens the researcher's argument because if many joggers have difficulty performing stretches due to previous injuries, it means stretching could help prevent the injuries in the first place.
C: This statement strengthens the researcher's argument because it suggests that most jogging injuries would not be prevented by stretching.
D: This statement does not directly affect the researcher's argument. It only provides additional information about the habits of joggers.
E: This statement weakens the researcher's argument because it shows that there are certain forms of exercise where stretching can reduce the severity of injuries, and jogging could be one of them.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, based on a comparison of two groups of joggers, one stretching and one not, that incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  A: This statement provides additional information about the injury rate in both groups, but it does not directly address whether stretching before jogging is beneficial or not.
  B: This statement suggests that prior injuries may have made stretching difficult for some, which could have skewed the results of the study, and thus could weaken the argument of the medical researcher.
  C: This statement provides information about the causes of jogging injuries and suggests that stretching may not be effective for preventing certain types of injuries, but it does not directly address the argument of the medical researcher in regards to the overall effectiveness of stretching.
  D: This statement provides information about the relationship between injury proneness and stretching, but it does not directly address the argument of the medical researcher.
  E: This statement provides evidence that contradicts the medical researcher's argument, as it indicates that stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher is arguing that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  A: This statement does not impact the argument of whether stretching before jogging helps to prevent injuries or not.
  B: This statement weakens the medical researcher's argument by suggesting that many of the joggers who were injured did not stretch, not because stretching is ineffective, but because they found it difficult to perform stretches.
  C: This statement supports the medical researcher's argument by suggesting that injuries resulting from factors other than flexibility, such as falls or collisions, are the primary cause of jogging injuries.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument of whether stretching before jogging helps to prevent injuries or not.
  E: This statement weakens the medical researcher's argument by suggesting that stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, because two groups of joggers, one that stretches before jogging and one that doesn't, incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  A: This statement provides additional information about the rate of jogging injuries in general, but it is not relevant to the medical researcher's argument.
  B: This statement suggests that the joggers who stretch before jogging have difficulty in stretching and may not be doing it correctly, thus weakening the researcher's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that injuries from jogging mainly come from mishaps, but it does not weaken the researcher's argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  D: This statement suggests a correlation between the likelihood of a jogger developing the habit of stretching before jogging and the likelihood of sustaining injuries. This statement does not provide evidence against the researcher's argument.
  E: This statement presents evidence that contradicts the medical researcher's argument. If stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from exercise, then the fact that stretching does not prevent injuries for joggers may not be true for other forms of exercise.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The medical researcher stated that because both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries, stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
A: This statement supports the medical researcher's argument.
B: This statement suggests that the injuries in the group of joggers who stretched before the jog may have been prevented if they did not stretch. This weakens the medical researcher's argument.
C: This statement suggests that stretching before jogging would not have an effect on the overall rate of injuries. It does not necessarily weaken the argument that stretching does not help to prevent injuries.
D: This statement suggests that those who stretch before jogging do so because they are already prone to jogging injuries, which weakens the argument that stretching is the cause for the same number of injuries in both groups.
E: This statement is not relevant to the comparison of the two groups of joggers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries based on the comparison of equal numbers of joggers who stretch before jogging and joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.

A: This choice provides additional information that is relevant to both groups of joggers compared by the scientists. The fact that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries, weakens the argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. However, this choice does not address whether stretching helps to prevent jogging injuries. 
B: This choice provides information about the experience of many of those who were previously injured while jogging. However, it does not provide evidence relevant to the argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
C: This choice provides information about the main causes of jogging injuries, indicating that stretching may not help to prevent most jogging injuries. Hence, this weakens the argument that stretching before jogging helps to prevent injuries.
D: This choice indicates that individuals who are more prone to jogging injuries develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging. While this may be true, it does not address whether stretching before jogging helps to prevent jogging injuries. Hence, it is not relevant to the argument.
E: This choice provides information that is in contrast to the researcher's conclusion. It argues that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise. However, this choice does not address whether stretching before jogging helps to prevent jogging injuries.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the question assumes a causal relationship between major and course selection and infers that the number of sociology majors enrolled in the class must be greater than the number of psychology majors enrolled in the class. This conclusion cannot be justified based on the premise provided.
A: This argument assumes that ownership of a painting collection correlates with the museum's decision to display paintings from different centuries.
B: This argument assumes that the residents' preference for one type of spending necessarily implies that they are opposed to the other type of spending.
C: This argument assumes that the number of trees in the arboretum correlates with the species, local, or exotic.
D: This argument assumes that the availability of organic vegetables at the Valley Food Co-op correlates with more organic vegetables being available than at Jumbo.
E: This argument assumes that the number of houses being sold by Acme Realty correlates with the number of houses listed on their website.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning. It concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in a class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class and most psychology majors are not.
A: This argument presents the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the initial argument, where the conclusion is based on the premise that most paintings on display at the museum are from the twentieth century, and most paintings the museum owns are from the nineteenth century. 
B: This argument presents the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the initial argument, where the conclusion is based on the premise that more residents of Silver Falls are in favor of increased spending on roads than on parks. 
C: This argument presents the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the initial argument, where the conclusion is based on the premise that most of the trees in the arboretum are of local rather than exotic species. 
D: This argument presents the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the initial argument, where the conclusion is based on the premise that most of the vegetables available at Valley Food Co-op are organic and most of the vegetables available at Jumbo Supermarket are not. 
E: This argument presents a different flawed pattern of reasoning, where the conclusion is based on the premise that Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses but fewer than half of the condominiums that it is offering for sale.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: Flawed pattern of reasoning refers to the errors that can occur when making an argument. The question asks to identify an argument that has similar flawed reasoning as the original argument.
A: This argument is flawed because it is not considering the overlap between the paintings displayed in the museum and the paintings that the museum owns.
B: This argument is flawed because it is assuming that those who did not express an opinion are not in favor of either option.
C: This argument is flawed because it uses information about the trees in the San Felipe city arboretum to make a general claim about the San Felipe area.
D: This argument is flawed because it makes a comparison between two stores, but does not consider the quantity of vegetables available at each store.
E: This argument is flawed because it is assuming that the number of condos and houses that Acme Realty is selling is the same.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument looks at the enrollment of majors in a specific class, which does not necessarily represent the majors' overall enrollment. 
  A: The argument looks at the ownership and displaying of art in a museum, which do not necessarily indicate the museum's possession of certain types of art.
  B: The argument looks at the result of an opinion poll, which may not represent the views of the entire population or indicate the population's preferences in other areas.
  C: The argument looks at the species of trees in a specific arboretum, which may not represent the species distribution in the San Felipe area. 
  D: The argument looks at the availability of vegetables in two specific stores, which may not represent the overall availability of organic vegetables. 
  E: The argument looks at the Acme Realty website's representation of the houses and condominiums for sale, which may not represent the actual number of houses and condominiums for sale.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument given above concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in a particular course, based solely on the fact that "most" of the sociology majors are taking the course and "most" of the psychology majors are not.
A: The argument concludes that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays, based solely on the fact that "most" of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but "most" of the paintings the museum owns are from the nineteenth century.
B: The argument concludes that most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks, based solely on the fact that more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks in an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents.
C: The argument concludes that there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species in the San Felipe area, based solely on the fact that most of the trees in the San Felipe city arboretum are of local rather than exotic species.
D: The argument concludes that more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo, based solely on the fact that most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Whether or not one can rightfully call a person's faithfulness a virtue depends in part on the object of that personas faithfulness. Virtues are by definition praiseworthy, which is why no one considers resentment virtuous, even though it is in fact a kind of faithfulness-faithfulness to hatreds or animosities.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous.
  B: Virtuous behavior is praiseworthy by definition.
  C: Behavior that emerges from hatred or animosity cannot be called virtuous.
  D: Faithfulness and resentment are obviously different, despite some similarities.
  E: Resentment should not be considered a virtuous emotion.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The conclusion of the argument is that whether or not one can rightfully call a person's faithfulness a virtue depends in part on the object of that faithfulness. This is best expressed in option A. Option B is a premise of the argument, not the conclusion. Option C is a specific example of the conclusion, rather than the overall conclusion. Option D is not the conclusion and is not supported by the argument. Option E is a specific example of the conclusion, rather than the overall conclusion.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: 
- The passage discusses the relationship between faithfulness and virtue.
- The argument states that the object of a person's faithfulness determines whether or not faithfulness is virtuous.
- The passage uses resentment as an example of faithfulness that is not considered virtuous by most people.

Analysis:
- The passage presents an argument that the object of faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous.
- This argument is supported by the example of resentment being considered non-virtuous.
- The passage does not make a direct argument about whether virtuous behavior is praiseworthy by definition.
- The passage does not argue that faithfulness and resentment are obviously different, despite some similarities.
- While the passage states that resentment is not considered virtuous, it does not present this as a singular conclusion. 

Answering the question asks for the most accurate conclusion that can be drawn from the argument, which is best represented by answer choice A.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: 
  The argument discusses how the object of faithfulness determines whether or not it is virtuous. 
  The argument also says that virtues are praiseworthy and that resentment is not virtuous, even though it involves faithfulness.

A: This choice accurately represents the conclusion drawn in the argument. 
B: This choice is too broad. While the argument mentions that virtues are praiseworthy, it doesn't frame its conclusion as a definition of virtuous behavior. 
C: This choice accurately represents one of the key examples used in the argument to support its conclusion, but it doesn't fully represent the overall conclusion. 
D: This choice is too narrow. While the argument compares resentment and faithfulness, it doesn't present this comparison as its overall conclusion. 
E: This choice accurately represents one of the examples used to support the argument's conclusion, but like choice C, it doesn't fully capture the conclusion. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. The conclusion drawn from the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A most accurately expresses this conclusion. Choice B is a true statement, but it does not express the overall conclusion drawn in the argument. Choice C is also a true statement, but it is a specific example rather than the overall conclusion. Choice D is a true statement, but it is not the overall conclusion drawn in the argument. Choice E is related to the argument, but it is not the overall conclusion.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument acknowledges that faithfulness is not always virtuous, and that it depends on the object of faithfulness. The author then uses resentment as an example of faithfulness that is not virtuous. Therefore, the overall conclusion is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A most accurately expresses this conclusion.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses how the object of faithfulness determines whether it can be considered virtuous. It also provides an example of how faithfulness to hatreds or animosities is not considered virtuous. So, the overall conclusion drawn in the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 

B is incorrect because though it is mentioned in the passage, it is not the overall conclusion.
C is incorrect because it is only one of the examples of the conclusion, and does not express the overall conclusion.
D is incorrect because it only mentions the differences between two things without giving a conclusion about them.
E is incorrect because it does not cover the entirety of the conclusion.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
  The argument discusses the relationship between faithfulness and virtues.
  Faithfulness to objects that are virtuous can be considered virtuous.
  Resentment is not a virtuous object of faithfulness.
  
Reasoning:
  The author draws a contrast between faithfulness to virtuous objects and faithfulness to resentment. 
  Since resentment is not virtuous, the conclusion of the argument is that behavior that emerges from it cannot be called virtuous.
  
Answer C: Behavior that emerges from hatred or animosity cannot be called virtuous. is the most accurate expression of the overall conclusion drawn in the argument, and is supported by the reasoning.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: 
The argument focuses on faithfulness as a virtue, and argues that the object of one's faithfulness is an important consideration in evaluating whether that faithfulness is virtuous. The author also makes the point that some kinds of faithfulness are praiseworthy virtues, while other are not. The example of resentment is used to illustrate how faithfulness to something other than a praiseworthy object cannot be considered virtuous. 

Answer choice A most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument, which is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. The argument is primarily focused on this point, and the other statements made in the argument support or illustrate this conclusion.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument talks about how the object of a person's faithfulness determines whether it is virtuous or not. The author also mentions that virtues are praiseworthy and that resentment, despite being a form of faithfulness, is not considered virtuous. The overall conclusion is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous, which is why resentment is not virtuous. Therefore, the best answer is A.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument discusses whether faithfulness is a virtue and how it depends on its object. It also mentions that resentment is not a virtue, despite being a kind of faithfulness.
  A: This accurately expresses the main point of the argument.
  B: This is mentioned in the argument but does not capture the main point.
  C: This is mentioned in the argument but only relates to resentment, not faithfulness.
  D: This is true, but it is only a small part of the argument and not the main conclusion.
  E: This statement is mentioned in the argument but it does not provide the overall conclusion.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The advertisement is claiming that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested, based on a study in which volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, with most of the volunteers saying they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.

A: This choice criticizes the generalization based on the specific groups tested in the study.
B: This choice is bringing up a new issue of the cost of Sparkle Cola versus the other colas and how it affects purchasing decisions, unrelated to the study.
C: This choice raises the possibility that there are colas that were not tested which may actually elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
D: This choice criticizes the claim made in the advertisement as it states there could be reasons other than taste why people preferred Sparkle Cola such as price or packaging.
E: This choice is going beyond the scope of the question as it does not address any of the reasoning presented in the advertisement.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing colas tested in the study.
  A: This choice questions the generalization made in the advertisement about the entire group and its applicability to the smaller groups.
  B: This choice presents an assumption that is not made in the argument regarding the willingness of the volunteers to buy Sparkle Cola.
  C: This choice raises the possibility that Sparkle Cola might not be preferred over other untested colas.
  D: This choice challenges the basic premise of the advertisement regarding why people might prefer Sparkle Cola to the other colas tested.
  E: This choice is irrelevant to the argument made in the advertisement.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers in a study preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. However, the advertisement provides limited information about how the study was conducted, including the sample size, the composition of the sample, and the methods used to ensure that the study was conducted in a careful and unbiased manner. 

A: This criticism is not particularly relevant, as the study was designed to compare Sparkle Cola to five competing colas, not to make generalizations about larger populations. 

B: This criticism does not address the validity of the study's conclusion about Sparkle Cola and the competing colas tasted. 

C: This criticism is relevant, as many factors may influence consumers' preferences for different brands of cola, and the study did not test all possible colas. 

D: This criticism is relevant, as the study does not consider factors other than taste that may affect consumers' preferences for different brands of cola. 

E: This criticism is not relevant, as the study was designed to compare Sparkle Cola to five competing colas, not to make generalizations about all types of beverages.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested. Blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.

A: This option might be true, but it is irrelevant to the reasoning provided.
B: This option might be true, but it is not mentioned in the reasoning provided.
C: This option might be true, but it is irrelevant to the reasoning provided.
D: This is a likely criticism. The reasoning provided assumes that taste is the only factor that influences consumers and ignores other factors that might lead consumers to choose Sparkle Cola over other colas.
E:  This option might be true, but it is irrelevant to the reasoning provided.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement describes a study involving blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  A: This choice correctly identifies one potential problem with the study. The study only looks at the preferences of the five groups and overlooks the possibility that the generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the smaller groups.
  B: This choice goes beyond the information in the study. There is no information about the price or comparative pricing of the colas.
  C: This choice suggest the possibility of another cola eliciting a better response than Sparkle Cola in the test. However, there is no information to suggest that.
  D: This choice suggests that consumer's preference may not only be driven by taste, but other factors like price or packaging. This may be a valid criticism of the study, as the advertisement draws conclusions from taste tests alone without addressing other factors that may drive consumer's preference.
  E: This choice does not address the reasoning in the advertisement.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The advertisement claims that blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five different competing colas. However, the methodology and implications of the study are open to criticism. 
A: This choice could be a criticism, but it is not most vulnerable because the study did compare the preferences of all five groups of volunteers. 
B: This choice is a criticism of the advertisement because it is not clear that most people would actually buy Sparkle Cola rather than a cheaper and similarly preferred alternative. 
C: This choice is a criticism of the advertisement because it is possible that other colas not tested in the study would have been preferred to Sparkle Cola, calling into question the claim that Sparkle Cola is the most preferred cola.
D: This choice is a criticism of the advertisement because people may prefer Sparkle Cola for reasons other than taste, making it unclear whether Sparkle Cola actually has the most favorable taste. 
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument being made about Sparkle Cola specifically. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The advertisement presents the results of a study where blind tested volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five competing colas and concludes that this shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
A: The study involves blindfolded volunteers divided into five groups, and each group tasted different colas, so the possibility of a generalization true for the entire group being untrue for each of the five smaller groups is low.
B: The advertisement does not provide any information about the cost of Sparkle Cola, so the assumption that volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola is not much expensive is irrelevant.
C: The advertisement is based on the study's results that show Sparkle Cola elicited a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested. Therefore, the possibility of some cola not tested in the study eliciting a more favorable response is not relevant.
D: While this could be an invalidating factor, the study was conducted to compare the preference of Sparkle Cola to other colas. Thus, the study's conclusion still holds valid, even if its reasons are subject to criticism.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the reasoning presented in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that the majority of blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to one of five competing colas tasted in a controlled study.
  
A: This option criticizes the advertisement's generalization of the entire group to a smaller sub-group. However, it doesn't directly relate to the study's methodology or results.
B: This option critiques an assumption made in the advertisement. However, it is not a criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement about the study done on the volunteers.
C: This option critiques the advertisement's methodology, suggesting there might be a different result if all possible colas were taken into consideration. However, it seems to be an unreasonably high standard to test all potential colas.
D: This option is a valid criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement because it suggests that factors other than taste might influence a consumer when choosing Sparkle Cola.
E: This option is irrelevant to the argument being made about the study done on the volunteers and their preferences. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement presents a study in which blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, and most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola over the other cola tasted.
  A: The study's findings were based on separate groups, with each group tasting a different cola including Sparkle Cola. It is unlikely to be a criticism of the study's reasoning.
  B: The advertisement does not suggest the volunteers would buy any of the colas they tasted. The advertisement concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than any of the competing colas tasted. Therefore, this is unlikely to be a criticism of the study's reasoning.
  C: This is a valid criticism. The study did not test colas other than the competing colas tasted, so the possibility that some untested cola would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola cannot be ruled out.
  D: This is a valid criticism. The study only measured the volunteers' preference for taste, not other factors such as packaging or price that may influence a person's decision to buy a drink.
  E: This is not a valid criticism, since the advertisement only claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than the competing colas tasted, not all beverages.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The study divided blindfolded volunteers into five groups, each tasting Sparkle Cola and a different competing cola.
  Most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The advertisement concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
A: This answer suggests that there is a possibility that the results are not generalizable to the population and each subgroup should have been taken into account when thinking about the results.
B: This answer assumes a consumer behavior that is not presented or suggested in the advertisement.
C: This answer considers the possibility that some other cola not tested might be better, which does not weaken the argument.  
D: This answer suggests an alternative reason for preferring Sparkle Cola but does not weaken the argument made in the advertisement.
E: This answer discusses a limitation of the study but does not challenge the logic in the argument made in the advertisement.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument uses a conditional statement, "if/then" logic, and wrongly assumes a sufficient condition.
  A: The argument uses a similar conditional statement but does not assume a sufficient condition.
  B: The argument uses a similar conditional statement and assumes a sufficient condition that is not necessarily true.
  C: The argument uses a causal statement and a different conditional logic than the original argument.
  D: The argument uses a similar conditional statement and assumes a sufficient condition that is not necessarily true.
  E: The argument uses a conditional statement, but the sufficient condition does not relate to the necessary condition.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument above is an example of flawed reasoning known as affirming the consequent, where a conditional statement is reversed, and the converse is assumed to be true. A is the antecedent, and B is the consequent. The argument incorrectly assumes that if B is true, then A is also true.
A: The argument does not follow the same pattern as the flawed reasoning in this option.
B: This argument also involves affirming the consequent and follows the same flawed pattern of reasoning.
C: This argument is not an example of affirming the consequent, so it does not follow the same flawed pattern of reasoning.
D: This argument is also an example of affirming the consequent and follows the same flawed pattern of reasoning.
E: This argument is not an example of affirming the consequent, so it does not follow the same flawed pattern of reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is a conditional argument of the form "If P, then Q". It also uses a conditional statement of the form "P if and only if not Q", which means that if Q is true, then P is false and vice versa.
  A: This argument is not similar to the argument above, as it uses a simple conditional statement.
  B: This argument is not similar to the argument above, as it does not use a conditional statement of the form "P if and only if not Q".
  C: This argument is not similar to the argument above, as it uses a different reasoning pattern.
  D: This argument is similar to the argument above in that it uses a conditional statement of the form "P if and only if not Q", but the order of the conditions is reversed.
  E: This argument is not similar to the argument above, as it introduces a new condition that can affect the conclusion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a conditional statement with two premises based on empirical observation: (1) A bird feeder with squirrels eating out from it will not attract many birds; and (2) Squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. The conclusion drawn from these two premises is that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover. However, the conclusion is flawed, because the argument assumes that the only reason why a bird feeder would not attract many birds is the presence of squirrels, while ignoring other possible reasons.
  A: This argument presents a valid causal relationship between tire pressure and tire wear and suggests that regularly checking tire pressure will prevent tires from wearing out prematurely.
  B: This argument presents a valid causal relationship between tire pressure and tire wear, but it goes further to suggest that tire wear is solely determined by whether car owners check tire pressure regularly or not, ignoring other possible reasons why tires may wear out prematurely.
  C: This argument presents a circular reasoning that assumes car owners are aware of the consequences of not checking tire pressure regularly, and hence concludes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of not checking tire pressure regularly.   
  D: This argument presents a valid causal relationship between tire pressure and tire wear, but it goes further to suggest that tire wear is solely determined by whether car owners check tire pressure regularly or not, ignoring other possible reasons why tires may wear out prematurely.
  E: This argument presents a valid causal relationship between tire pressure and tire wear on one hand, and driving on gravel roads and tire wear on the other hand. It also suggests that keeping the pressure from becoming too low will not help a tire to last longer when driven on gravel roads. However, it is not directly related to the flawed reasoning in the original argument.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument given is an example of converse error: if p then q, but instead of concluding p from q, it concludes q from p. 
  A: The argument is not similar to the given argument because it has an If/Then structure but it is not a converse error.
  B: The argument is similar to the given argument because it has an If/Then structure and is a converse error.
  C: The argument is not similar to the given argument because it is not an example of a converse error.
  D: The argument is similar to the given argument because it has an If/Then structure and is a converse error.
  E: The argument is not similar to the given argument because it has an If/Then structure but it is not a converse error.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: This is a question related to flawed reasoning. The argument given in the context is trying to establish a cause-and-effect relationship, but the premises and the conclusion do not establish the relationship. The correct answer should also demonstrate a flawed relationship between premises and a conclusion.
A: The argument establishes a cause-and-effect relationship, but the conclusion does not follow from the premises. So checking the tire pressure regularly might not necessarily extend the life of the tire.
B: The argument establishes a cause-and-effect relationship, and the conclusion follows from the premises. It is not similar to the argument in the context.
C: The argument establishes a cause-and-effect relationship, but it is not clear whether the car owners regularly check the tire pressure or not. So the conclusion may not follow from the premises.
D: The argument establishes a cause-and-effect relationship, and the conclusion follows from the premises. It is not similar to the argument in the context.
E: The argument establishes two different causes for the same effect. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The argument uses conditional reasoning. It indicates that if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, squirrels eat from it, which will scare off birds and therefore it will not attract birds. 

A: The argument deals with cause-and-effect, not conditional reasoning. 
B: The argument uses conditional reasoning but the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. 
C: The argument deals with cause-and-effect, not conditional reasoning.
D: The argument uses conditional reasoning but the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises.
E: The argument is not similar in structure to the original argument. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover and that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover. This argument assumes that the only reason why the bird feeder does not attract many birds is because of squirrels. It ignores other possible reasons that might be the cause for the bird feeder not attracting many birds, such as the lack of food or lack of water.
  A: This argument describes a cause and effect relationship and concludes that regularly checking the tire pressure will prevent tire wear. This argument is not flawed and arrives at a reasonable conclusion based on the causal relationship.
  B: This argument concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly and assumes that this is the only reason for tire wear. This argument is similar to the flawed argument in the question stem; both ignore other possible causes for the effect.
  C: This argument concludes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly and assumes that all car owners are unaware of the fact that neglecting to check tire pressure will lead to tire wear. This argument is not flawed, but it does make assumptions that are not necessarily true.
  D: This argument concludes that neglecting to check pressure regularly leads to tire wear and assumes that this is the only reason for tire wear. This argument is similar to the flawed argument in the question stem.
  E: This argument concludes that keeping tire pressure from becoming too low will not help it last longer if it is often driven on gravel roads, and assumes that gravel roads are the only reason for tire wear. This argument is not flawed, but it does make assumptions that are not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument uses the "If A, then B" format, where A is the lack of a protective cover on a bird feeder and B is the bird feeder not attracting many birds.
  The argument assumes that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover, which may not be true.
  A: This argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument in the context. It is a logically valid argument.
  B: This argument also uses the "If A, then B" format, where A is neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly and B is a tire wearing out prematurely. It also assumes that low tire pressure only occurs due to a lack of regular checks, which may not always be true.
  C: This argument assumes that car owners are aware of the fact that neglecting to check tire pressure regularly will cause tires to wear out prematurely, which may not be true. It does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument in the context.
  D: This argument also uses the "If A, then B" format, where A is neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly and B is a tire wearing out prematurely. It assumes that low tire pressure only occurs due to a lack of regular checks, which may not always be true.
  E: This argument does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the argument in the context. It is a logically valid argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument provides premises that: 
  - Squirrels eat from bird feeders only if they lack a protective cover.
  - If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
  - Therefore, if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, it will not attract many birds.

  A: The argument provides premises that 
  - If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely.
  - If a tire wears out prematurely a likely cause is that the pressure was too low.
  - Checking the tire pressure regularly is sufficient for tires not to wear out prematurely. 
  This argument doesn't have the same flawed pattern as the given argument.

  B: The argument provides premises that 
  - If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely.
  - Tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  - Therefore, a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  This argument has the same flawed pattern as the given argument.

  C: The argument provides premises that 
  - Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly.
  - Car owners are aware of this fact and thus check the tire pressure regularly.
  - Therefore, car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  This argument doesn't have the same flawed pattern as the given argument.

  D: The argument provides premises that 
  - If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely.
  - Tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  - Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  This argument has the same flawed pattern as the given argument.

  E: The argument provides premises that 
  - If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely.
  - A tire will wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads.
  - Therefore, keeping tire pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer if it is often driven on gravel roads.
  This argument doesn't have the same flawed pattern as the given argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that people who watch more than an average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of natural disasters. So, the correct answer should show that watching television is not the reason for overestimating the risk of natural disasters.
  
A: This statement doesn't talk about the effect of watching television on overestimating the risks of natural disasters. It's talking about people's general behavior. So, this option doesn't weaken the argument.
  
B: This statement goes against the argument. It shows that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in areas that are prone to natural disasters. This option weakens the argument.
  
C: This statement supports the argument. It states that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have an accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. So, this option doesn't weaken the argument.
  
D: This statement doesn't weaken the argument. While it says that people who are well informed about natural disasters didn't learn this information by watching television, it doesn't mean that watching less TV means people are more scientifically aware or rightly informed or are less fearful.
  
E: This statement doesn't weaken the argument. It gives an additional fact but it doesn't show any correlation between watching TV and overestimating the risk of natural disasters. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The reasoning above is that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of being victims of a natural disaster.
  
A: This option does not address the relationship between watching too much television and the overestimation of the risks of natural disasters.
  
B: If a person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters when they watch an above-average amount of television, then this contradicts the initial reasoning that suggests that watching too much television leads to overestimating risks of natural disasters.

C: This option supports the initial reasoning by stating that people who watch a below-average amount of television have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of a natural disaster, therefore suggesting that watching too much television leads to overestimating the risks.

D: This option suggests that people who are better informed about the risks posed by natural disasters have obtained that information through a way other than watching television; however, it does not weaken the initial reasoning.

E: This option suggests that living in an area that is prone to natural disasters is more common among people who watch an above-average amount of television than those who do not; however, it does not affect the initial reasoning that watching too much television can lead to overestimating risks.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate risks posed to them, such as the risk of being a victim of a natural disaster. 

A: This answer choice is irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between television and perception of dangers.
B: This answer choice is irrelevant because it does not address how television affects people's perception of danger.
C: This answer choice supports the argument and does not weaken it.
D: This answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting that some people may become well informed about natural disasters without watching television.
E: This answer choice is irrelevant because it does not address how perception of danger is affected by amount of television watched.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. If people watch an above-average amount of TV, they are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  A: This statement, if true, does not weaken the argument because it suggests that overestimating dangers regardless of the amount of TV they watch.
  B: This statement actually supports the argument's reasoning, since a person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television.
  C: This statement, if true, weakens the argument, as it suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, so the correlation between watching TV and overestimating the risks may not be true. 
  E: This statement is out of scope and does nothing to address the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risks of being a victim of a natural disaster than those who do not.
  
A: This statement does not address or weaken the argument. It merely makes a general statement that many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are actually less likely to live in an area prone to natural disasters. Therefore, the argument's conclusion cannot be based on the amount of television people watch.
C: This statement supports the argument because it suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to be more accurate in their estimation of natural disaster risks.
D: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that people who are well-informed about natural disaster risks do not rely on television as their main source of information.
E: This statement does not address or weaken the argument. It merely suggests that television viewing habits could be influenced by living in an area prone to natural disasters.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. One example provided is a study that found a correlation between watching an above-average amount of television and overestimating the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
A: This statement weakens the conclusion that watching too much television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters by suggesting that overestimating the danger is a more general issue that affects people regardless of their TV-watching habits. However, it does not directly address the relationship between TV watching and natural disaster risks.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument and does not relate to the impact of television viewing on risk assessments.
C: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that people who watch less television are more accurate in assessing the risks posed by natural disasters. Hence, it does not weaken the argument.
D: This statement provides an alternative explanation for why people may be well-informed about natural disaster risks without watching television, but it does not directly challenge the link between television viewing and risk assessments.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument and does not relate to the impact of television viewing on risk assessments.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
The argument is that people who watch a lot of TV overestimate the risks of natural disasters. 
A: This weakens the argument only if it is shown that TV watching does not have an effect on overestimating risks. However, this answer choice states that many people tend to overestimate the danger of the world regardless of TV watching, which does not actually address TV's role in overestimating natural disasters. 
B: This is out of context and contradicts the argument even further by showing counter evidence that if people watch more TV, they are less likely to live in areas that are prone to natural disasters, which does not support the initial statement. 
C: This choice supports the initial argument. If people who watch less TV tend to have a more accurate understanding of natural disasters, then watching TV is likely to be the cause of overestimation of natural disasters. 
D: This choice supports the argument by providing an alternative source of information besides TV.  
E: This is out of context and does not address the argument at all. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument concludes that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks in the world, leading to a belief that they are more likely to be victims of a natural disaster. 
A: This statement, even if true, does not directly affect the argument's conclusion about the relationship between watching too much television and overestimating risks. It is stating that people overestimate dangers regardless of TV viewing habits. 
B: This statement would weaken the argument because it suggests that those who watch more television are actually less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, making the conclusion that television viewing causes overestimation of risk less probable. 
C: This statement does not weaken the argument's conclusion because it only describes the accuracy of people's perceptions regarding natural disasters in relation to their television viewing habits. 
D: This statement provides an alternative reason for why someone might be well-informed about natural disasters and does not weaken the original argument's conclusion. 
E: This statement does not directly affect the argument's conclusion that watching too much television can lead to overestimating the risks posed by natural disasters. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risk of being a victim of a natural disaster. It can be assumed that the reason behind this is that television shows often exaggerate the threat of natural disasters.
  A: This answer choice does not weaken the argument. It merely states that many people overestimate the dangers posed by the world. It does not weaken the connection between watching television and overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  B: This answer choice also does not weaken the argument. While it does state that a person is less likely to live in an area prone to natural disasters if they watch more television, this does not refute the fact that watching more television can lead to overestimating the risks posed by natural disasters.
  C: This answer choice strengthens the argument - if people who watch less television have a more accurate idea of the risks of natural disasters, then this implies that watching television does lead to overestimating the risk posed by natural disasters.
  D: This answer choice weakens the argument by implying that there are other ways people can be informed about natural disaster risks. Therefore, it is possible that people who are more informed about natural disasters may not be prone to the same degree of overestimating their risks.
  E: Although people living in an area prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more television, this does not weaken or strengthen the argument. It introduces a different topic and does not provide any information about the relationship between television viewing and overestimation of natural disasters risk. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The author argues that watching too much television might lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them, And that the likelihood they think to be victims of natural disaster is higher if they watch TV more. 

A: This argument does not concern whether many people overestimate the dangers of the world regardless of watching TV or not.
B: If the residents who watch TV every day live in areas with lower natural disaster risk, then this would create an alternative explanation as to why the television watchers are overestimating the risk of being a victim of a natural disaster. But if residents who watch more TV are just as likely to live in areas with high natural disaster risks as people who watch less TV, this response does not weaken the argument.
C: This choice supports the author's argument. According to this response, people who watch less television than average are less likely to overestimate the natural disaster risk.
D: This option presents an alternative explanation that people can become well-informed in some other way than the TV.
E: This option poses another alternative explanation. However, it is discussing the content of the TV rather than the frequency that can lead people to a higher perception of natural disaster risk, so it's irrelevant.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's argument is that a study of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. The critic's observation is that although correct, the sample size of 6 was very small.
A: The biologist's argument does not take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole. It specifically mentions 'lizards such as chameleons', implying that the conclusion only applies to lizards with similar behavior to chameleons.
B: The argument provides an explanation of the conclusion of the study - that chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
C: The argument does mention the study itself (concluding that the result is not to be doubted) but also appeals to the author's excellence, which may not necessarily be relevant to the situation.
D: There is no information to conclude that the study's critics are irrelevant or lack expertise.
E: The argument is more vulnerable to criticism on this ground as it appeals to the author's excellence as a way to justify the conclusion without independently proving that the study was conducted and analyzed correctly.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
The biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).
Response 2:
Knowledge:
Biologist's conclusion: lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
Critics' observation: sample size was very small.
Biologist's defense: author of the study is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.

Action: Answer("A") 

Explanation: 
The argument may be criticized on the ground that it takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole. The argument concludes that lizards bask in sun not only to keep themselves warm but also for regulation of vitamin D. The study, however, only evaluates the behavior of six individual chameleons. Therefore, it is unclear whether the conclusion is applicable to lizards as a whole or not.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
The conclusion that the critics are wrong to doubt the results of the study, because the author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years, is irrelevant to the validity of the study. The argument holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics, which makes it vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the actual criticisms made by the critics and simply diverts attention to the study's author. Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist conducted a study that concluded that lizards bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. 
  The study's sample size was small, and its author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
A: The argument does not take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole as it refers to the study of six individual chameleons. 
B: The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun as the study's conclusion is that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. 
C: The argument does focus on the study author's credibility, but this is not its primary flaw.
D: The argument does not fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise.
E: The argument's reasoning might be vulnerable to criticism if the argument were to hold the study author to a higher standard than the study's critics, but it is not apparent from the argument that this is the case.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that the critics are wrong to doubt the results of the study, despite the small sample size, because the author is well-regarded and has been producing excellent work for years. 
  A: The biologist does not make a claim that the behavior of chameleons is generalizable to all lizards, they only focus on their behavior.
  B: The biologist clearly states that chameleons regulate their production of vitamin D by basking in the sun.
  C: The biologist's argument does indeed focus on the author's credibility over the study's details.
  D: The argument does not touch on whether the critics have relevant experience, it only talks about their doubts.
  E: The argument does not make any comparisons between the standards to which the author and the critics are held.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The biologist concludes that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D based on a study of six individual chameleons.
  Critics acknowledge that the study's sample size was very small.
  The study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  
A: The argument is about chameleons, not lizards as a whole. Choice A is incorrect.
B: The argument states that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D. It does not explain how. Choice B is incorrect.
C: The argument mentions the critics but does not focus exclusively on the study's author. Choice C is incorrect.
D: The argument does not demonstrate that the critics have invalid expertise. Choice D is incorrect.
E: This is the correct answer because the line of reasoning holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics. The argument implies that the study's author's professionalism and reputation is sufficient to rebut the criticism of the study's sample size. Choice E is correct.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The biologist's argument concludes that critics of a study of chameleons are wrong to doubt its results due to the author's good reputation, despite the small sample size. 
- The study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun for both warmth and to regulate vitamin D. 

A: This choice is out of the scope because even though the argument mentions chameleons, it does not claim that the behavior of chameleons can be generalized to all lizards. 

B: The argument acknowledges that chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun. Thus, this choice is incorrect.

C: The argument indeed relies on an appeal to the authority of the study author and ignores comments on the study itself, so this choice is the best answer.

D: This choice is not relevant to the argument as the argument does not evaluate the critics' expertise.

E: There is no evidence in the argument for this choice, so it is incorrect.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
The biologist's argument defends the validity of the study's results based on the author's reputation and past work, implying that the positive outcome is reliable because of the author's track record. However, this argument ignores the logical fallacy of appealing to authority and holds the author of the study to a higher standard than the study's critics. Therefore, choice E is the best answer. Choices A, B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not directly relevant to the reasoning vulnerability of the biologist's argument.
Response 9:
The biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago, based on the premise that the subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically over the last several years while the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant.
  A: This statement provides information about how university libraries are addressing increased journal subscription costs, however it does not affect the argument that publishing a scholarly journal is more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  B: This statement provides information about the overall budget of a university library, however it does not affect the argument that publishing a scholarly journal is more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  C: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that publishers of scholarly journals cannot consistently make a profit if they keep losing money.
  D: This statement does not affect the argument as it does not provide any information about the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
  E: This statement does not affect the argument as it does not provide any information about the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument states that the increased subscription rates indicate that publishing a scholarly journal must be more profitable now than it was several years ago.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
B: This statement also has nothing to do with the argument.
C: This statement does not weaken the argument, but rather supports it by indicating that publishers must make a profit to survive financially.
D: This statement is relevant to the argument by suggesting that libraries may be paying more for subscriptions than individuals, thus weakening the argument that increased subscription rates automatically indicate higher profits.
E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument presented in the context is that the increased subscription rates indicate that publishing a scholarly journal is now much more profitable than it was several years ago, despite constant publishing costs.
  
A: This option does not discuss the profitability of publishing scholarly journals. It is about university libraries passing on the increased costs of journal subscriptions to library users. Irrelevant. 

B: This suggests that even though a significant amount of the acquisition budget of university libraries is spent on journal subscriptions, the acquisition budget might still be a small portion of the university's budget. This weakens the argument that the increased subscription rates indicate that publishing a scholarly journal is now much more profitable than it was several years ago.

C: The argument is based on the premise that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant, which is not challenged by this option. Thus, it is not a strong enough weakener of the argument. 

D: This option acknowledges that subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years, but it does not address the central point of the argument, which is the profitability of publishing scholarly journals. Irrelevant.

E: This option does not have any relevance to the profitability of publishing scholarly journals. Irrelevant.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the costs of publishing scholarly journals have remained constant, but the subscription rates have increased, making publishing profitable.
  A: Increase in fines does not have an impact on the argument.
  B: The size of the library's budget is not relevant in evaluating the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
  C: If publishing scholarly journals is expensive and publishers cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money, then it suggests publishing scholarly journals may not necessarily be profitable.
  D: This statement suggests that the subscription rates for individuals have not increased in the last few years, weakening the argument that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  E: This statement doesn't have any impact on the argument presented. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates suggests that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  A: This statement is irrelevant since it is discussing a different issue (overdue fees).
  B: This statement may weaken the argument slightly, but it is not the most significant weakness.
  C: This statement supports the initial argument.
  D: This statement suggests there has been no increase in subscription rates for individuals which contradicts the claim in the argument.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it only discusses the frequency of the publication.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that the high subscription rates of scholarly journals suggest they are more profitable now relative to the past despite stable costs of publishing them.
A: This statement talks about a different issue of university libraries charging more fines for overdue books and periodicals, which is unrelated to the argument.
B: This statement provides information about the university library's operational budget but doesn't offer information about the profitability of scholarly journals.
C: This statement supports the argument and thus cannot be the answer.
D: This statement weakens the argument by providing information that the subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged for the past several years, meaning that the high subscription rates may not indicate more profitability now.
E: This statement, while may be interesting, is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")

A: This option is not relevant to the argument
B: This option is not relevant to the argument
C: This option actually somewhat strengthens the argument since it highlights the fact that publishers cannot consistently lose money.
D: This option weakens the argument by stating that the subscription rates for individuals, who are the majority of subscribers, have generally remained unchanged.
E: This option is not relevant to the argument
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument assumes that the increased subscription rate paid by universities suggests that scholarly journal publishers are making more profit now than before. 
A: This statement is not relevant to the discussion of whether or not scholarly publishers have become more profitable in recent years.
B: This statement is not related to the argument that scholarly publishers are becoming more profitable relative to the increase in subscription rates charged to universities.
C: This statement supports, rather than weakens, the argument that increased subscription rates suggest increased profitability for scholarly publishers.
D: If most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and subscription rates for individuals have not changed in several years, then the argument may be severely weak, as the hypothesis of increasing profitability should only apply to libraries, not individuals.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychologist: Doctors should never prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia. Most cases of insomnia that psychologists treat are known to be caused by psychological stress. This suggests that insomniacs do not need drugs that alter their biochemistry, but rather need psychotherapy to help them alleviate the stress causing their insomnia.
Question: Each of the following describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: It presumes, without providing warrant, that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress.
  B: It fails to consider the possibility that sedatives are the only treatment known to be effective for cases of insomnia not caused by stress.
  C: It neglects the possibility that for some people psychotherapy is a completely ineffective treatment for stress.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress.
  E: It presumes, without providing justification, that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The psychologist's argument suggests that psychotherapy is a preferable treatment for insomnia caused by psychological stress, and that sedatives are not necessary or helpful.
  
A: This statement describes a potential flaw in the psychologist's reasoning - that they may be presuming a causal relationship between insomnia and stress, without evidence to support it. This may be a flaw, but it is not an exception to the psychologist's reasoning. It is consistent with the argument to presume a causal relationship between insomnia and stress for the purposes of recommending psychotherapy as a treatment.
  B: This statement describes a potential alternative treatment to insomnia not caused by stress. However, this does not describe an exception to the psychologist's argument.
  C: This statement describes a potential alternative treatment to psychotherapy - that it may not work for some insomniacs. This does not describe an exception to the psychologist's argument either.
  D: This statement is consistent with the psychologist's argument, and not an exception to the reasoning.
E: This statement describes a possible representativeness issue - that the cases of insomnia treated by the psychologist are not representative of all cases of insomnia. However, this is also consistent with the psychologist's argument and not an exception to the reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The passage suggests that doctors should not prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia and that psychotherapy could be a better alternative. The reasoning is that most cases of insomnia are caused by psychological stress.

A: The passage does not mention insomnia contributing to an inability to cope with stress, so this is not a flaw in reasoning.
B: This is a possible flaw, but the passage does not suggest that sedatives are the only effective treatment for insomnia. It only argues that sedatives are not necessary for people with insomnia caused by psychological stress.
C: This is a possible flaw, but the passage does not claim that psychotherapy is the only effective treatment for stress. It only suggests that it could be a more appropriate treatment for insomnia caused by psychological stress.
D: This is a possible flaw, but the passage suggests that sedatives are not necessary for people with insomnia caused by psychological stress and that psychotherapy could be a better alternative.
E: This is a possible flaw. The passage only speaks to the cases of insomnia that psychologists treat, and it is possible that insomniacs who seek other forms of treatment may have different underlying causes for their insomnia.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: For this question, I will evaluate each of the options to identify which one does NOT describe a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
  A: This is a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning, because the psychologist presumed that people with insomnia have psychological stress without providing evidence to support that claim.
  B: This is a valid criticism of the psychologist's recommendations, because the psychologist did not consider the possibility that sedatives might be the only effective treatment for insomnia that is not caused by stress.
  C: This is a valid caveat to the psychologist's recommendation, as psychotherapy may not be effective for some people.
  D: This is a valid criticism of the psychologist's argument, as it overlooks the possibility that sedatives could be helpful in treating insomnia caused by stress.
  E: This is a valid criticism of the psychologist's argument, as it is possible that the cases of insomnia that psychologists treat are not representative of all cases of insomnia.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The psychologist believes that doctors should never prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia who have psychological stress because they need psychotherapy to alleviate the stress causing their insomnia.
A: This answer choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning because the argument does not support this presumption. It does not imply that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress without providing a warrant.
B: This answer choice is a valid criticism of the psychologist's reasoning because the psychologist fails to take into account the possibility that sedatives might be the only treatment for insomnia not caused by stress. 
C: This answer choice is a valid criticism of the psychologist's argument because the argument does not consider the possibility that psychotherapy is ineffective for some people. 
D: This answer choice is a valid criticism of the psychologist's argument. The argument overlooks the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress.
E: This answer choice describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning because the argument presumes without providing justification that the cases psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The question asks for the option that DOES NOT describe a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
  A: This option points out a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning by making a claim that is not supported by the argument.
  B: This option offers an alternate treatment option for insomnia but does not necessarily point out a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
  C: This option offers an alternate view of treatment for some people but again, does not necessarily point out a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
  D: This option offers an alternate treatment option for insomnia and points out a potential flaw in the psychologist's argument by neglecting to consider sedatives as a potential solution for coping with stress.
  E: This option points out a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning for assuming that all insomniacs suffer from stress-related insomnia.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The psychologist's statement asserts that sedatives should not be prescribed for people with insomnia because psychological stress is typically the cause of insomnia. The statement further suggests that psychotherapy, rather than sedatives, is the appropriate treatment for insomnia.
A: This choice is not a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning since the statement does not make the claim that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress.
B: If the psychologist had made the argument that there are no effective treatments other than psychotherapy, then this answer choice would be a valid flaw in their reasoning, but the statement doesn't suggest this.
C: In the statement, the psychologist doesn't claim that psychotherapy is the only effective treatment or that it will work for everyone. So, this isn't a flaw.
D: This statement is not made by the psychologist and is the opposite of what is stated in the argument. 
E: This is a valid flaw in the psychologist's reasoning. The psychologist's conclusion is based solely on their experience of treating cases of insomnia, and it neglects to acknowledge that there may be other causes of insomnia that require sedatives or other treatments.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The psychologist argues that doctors should not prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia and instead should prescribe psychotherapy to help them alleviate the stress causing their insomnia. 
  A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument's reasoning suggesting that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress. However, the argument is not based on this presumption.
  B: This choice suggests that the argument fails to consider an alternate possibility, a potential flaw. However, we are looking for the exception, not the potential flaw.
  C: This choice describes a flaw in the argument's reasoning suggesting that psychotherapy may be ineffective for some people. However, the argument does not explicitly claim that psychotherapy is effective for all insomniacs. 
  D: This choice suggests that the argument overlooks a potential benefit of sedatives but does not describe a flaw in the argument's reasoning. Therefore, it is the exception.
  E: This choice describes a flaw in the argument's reasoning suggesting that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are not representative of all cases of insomnia. This is a flaw in the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The psychologist argues that doctors prescribing sedatives for people with insomnia is not the best option, and instead psychotherapy would be more effective for insomnia caused by psychological stress.
  A: This option describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning, as insomnia contributing to an inability to cope with stress is not explicitly mentioned or inferred in the argument.
  B: This option describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning, as the argument does not discuss alternate treatments for insomnia besides psychotherapy.
  C: This option describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning, as it does not account for the effectiveness of psychotherapy for some individuals.
  D: This option is in line with the psychologist's reasoning, and does not describe a flaw.
  E: This option describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning, as it does not account for the possibility that the cases of insomnia the psychologist treats are not representative of all cases.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The psychologist argues that sedatives should never be prescribed to those with insomnia since most cases are caused by stress and can be treated with psychotherapy. 
  A: This choice critiques the argument that insomnia is caused by psychological stress. It does not address the flaw in the reasoning, but rather the assumption behind the reasoning. Therefore, this choice is not the correct answer.
  B: This choice points to a potential generalization the psychologist made by not considering alternative treatments. This suggests that the psychologist's reasoning might be incomplete. Therefore, this choice is the correct answer.
  C: This choice critiques the effectiveness of psychotherapy for psychological stress, but it does not address a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning. Therefore, this choice is not the correct answer.
  D: This choice suggests the possibility that sedatives could provide relief for insomniacs suffering from stress. It supports the opposing view but does not critique the psychologist’s reasoning. Therefore, this choice is not the correct answer.
  E: This choice critiques the assumption that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia. It questions the validity of the psychologist’s argument. Therefore, this choice is not the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The psychologist is arguing that insomnia caused by psychological stress should not be treated with sedatives but rather with psychotherapy.
A: This statement is not relevant to the psychologist's argument which focuses on the treatment of insomnia caused by stress, not how insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress. Therefore, it is not a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
B: This statement presents an alternative treatment for insomnia not caused by stress. It is not a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning as it pertains to a different category of insomnia.
C: This statement describes a weakness in the psychologist's argument as it suggests that psychotherapy may not be effective for everyone experiencing stress.
D: This statement describes a weakness in the psychologist's argument as it implies that sedatives might help insomniacs cope with stress.
E: This statement describes a weakness in the psychologist's argument as it implies that the sample of cases psychologists treat should be generalized to all insomniacs.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  A year ago several regional hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors in an attempt to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors. 
  The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. 
  The hospitals' staffs became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties because of the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored.
  
A: The statement suggests that the hospitals already had a policy in place to deal with life-threatening errors prior to the implementation of the current plan. This fact, while perhaps useful in other discussions, does not lend specific support to the argument that the knowledge of monitoring has led to increased accountability and better patient care.
B: The argument suggests that the decrease in injuries is a direct result of the implementation of the plan. The decrease in injuries at a hospital not included in the plan suggests other factors are responsible for the change in statistics, weakening the argument.
C: If the plan's reporting requirements were incomplete, it is possible that the staff was not penalized for many mistakes that still occurred. This fact weakens the argument that increased monitoring leads to increased accountability and safer care.
D: The knowledge of monitoring directly increases incentives for staff to be precise in their care, bringing strength to the initial claim made by the argument.
E: The punishment for mistakes may be an important factor in motivating the staff to be more careful in the future but is essentially beyond the scope of the claim that the transparency of monitoring leads to safer care. This statement also weakens rather than strengthens the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors has led to a substantial decrease in patient injuries caused by staff errors. The implication is that this decrease occurred because the staff became more meticulous when carrying out their patient-care duties due to the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored.
A: This statement is irrelevant because it does not strengthen the argument that the implementation of the plan was responsible for the decreased incidence of patient injuries.
B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be due to the implementation of the plan, as a hospital that did not participate in the plan also experienced a decrease in patient injuries in the same time frame. 
C: This statement is irrelevant because it does not affect the argument that the implementation of the plan has resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
D: This statement supports the argument as it indicates that there was a causal relationship between the implementation of the plan to record errors and a decrease in patient injuries. 
E: This statement is irrelevant because it does not address the argument that the implementation of the plan resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that implementing a plan to systematically record staff errors made the hospitals* staff members much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties, and the incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since the plan was implemented.
A: This choice talks about a policy that was already implemented before the current plan, but it doesn't strengthen the argument that the current plan was effective.
B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased, which suggests that there might be other factors contributing to the decrease in patient injuries and weakens the argument.
C: The plan didn't include all staff errors that did not result in patient injuries, but this doesn't provide any information that strengthens or weakens the argument.
D: If the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries didn't begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, it suggests that the records analysis was responsible for the decrease in patient injuries and strengthens the argument.
E: The fact that the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors received only reprimands for their first errors has no bearing on whether the plan was effective in decreasing the incidence of patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a policy that happened before the implementation of the plan.
  B: This fact is relevant, but it does not support the argument that the knowledge of the monitoring of the errors was the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.
  C: This statement weakens the argument because the plan did not record all the staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: This statement strongly supports the argument. It indicates that the knowledge that the errors were being closely monitored is what led to the decrease in patient injuries.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about the punishment for the staff members after committing errors, not about the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  A year ago several regional hospitals implemented a plan to record all patient-care errors, resulting in decreased the incidence of patient injuries caused by staff errors.
  
A: Thorough investigation of life-threatening staff errors existed before the plan. It is unlikely the knowledge of undergoing investigation had a sudden effect on staff behavior change. It is outside the scope of the given argument and doesn't provide any new information.
  
B: The incidence of patient injuries at the non-participating hospital decreased. However, this option does not indicate or link any reason/causation for the decrease of the incidence to the other hospitals participating in the plan.

C: The plan did not record all staff errors - This option points out a limitation of the plan, but does not provide new information that strengthens the argument that the plan decreased the incidence of patient injuries at the hospitals where the plan was implemented.

D: The decrease in the incidence of injuries was related to the knowledge of records being closely analyzed is consistent with the argument. It directly states that the decreased incidence rate started when staff members became aware that their errors were being monitored, which ties in with their more careful actions.

E: This option is out of the scope of the given argument. It is unrelated to the cause of the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries.
 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  A year ago regional hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors that cause patient injuries.
  Since then, patient injuries resulting from staff errors have substantially decreased.
  Knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made hospital staffs more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  
A: The plan doesn't affect how thoroughly the hospital investigates injuries that did happen.
B: This hospital stopped to participate in the plan. Even then, its incidence decreased. We cannot say whether the decrease was due to the plan.
C: The hospitals didn't record incidents of errors that could have caused injuries but did not. Even though it would have been better to record all errors But this doesn't weaken the plan's effect on staff members' behavior.
D: The decrease in the incidence of injuries has corelation with knowing that their errors were being carefully monitored. So it supports the idea.
E: This information doesn't strengthen the argument that "the knowledge [of recording] made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The hospital implemented a plan to systematically record all patient-care staff errors regarding patient injuries to reduce the number of injuries caused by staff errors. 
- The incidence of patient injuries caused by staff errors has substantially decreased at these hospitals since the implementation of the plan. 
- It is proposed that the decrease is due to the knowledge that staff errors were monitored more carefully under the new plan.
Choices:
  A: This statement does not strengthen or weaken the argument, as it does not provide any new information about the incidence of patient injuries caused by staff error.
  B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the regional hospital that did not participate in the new plan also experienced a decrease in patient injuries that were not monitored by the new plan. Therefore, other factors may have contributed to the decrease of patient injuries, not just the new plan.
  C: This statement, if true, weakens the argument because not recording the staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but didn’t, means the data isn’t comprehensive, accurate, or useful for analysis. There isn't the complete picture of staff error incidents to affirm the plan's effectiveness.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument, as it highlights that the knowledge of being monitored closely was a major incentive for the hospital staff to be more attentive and better at carrying out their patient-care duties. 
  E: This statement does not strengthen or weaken the argument, as it does not provide any new information on the incidence of patient injuries caused by staff errors since the implementation of the plan. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record all staff errors resulting in patient injuries, and as a result, the incidence of these injuries has decreased.
A: This statement does not relate to the argument regarding the effectiveness of the plan to decrease patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
B: This statement does not strengthen the argument relating to the effectiveness of the implemented plan since there is no evidence or cause to attribute the decrease in patient's injuries of that hospital within the region that did not participate in the plan to the same plan.
C: This statement weakens the argument since the hospital might have left out a considerable percentage of the errors made by the staff within their record, therefore not being able to have full monitoring of the staff behavior.
D: This statement strengthens the argument as it justifies that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries was a result of the implementation of the plan, implying that the knowledge of close monitoring caused staff to be more careful and cautious in their patient-care duties.
E: This statement does not relate to the argument regarding the effectiveness of the plan to decrease patient injuries resulting from staff errors in the first place.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has decreased at hospitals since the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors. The reason for this decrease is attributed to hospital staff becoming more careful in carrying out their patient-care duties as a result of knowing their errors were being monitored.
A: This choice provides information that the hospitals already had a policy to investigate errors that led to life-threatening injuries. However, there is no information to suggest that this policy had any impact on reducing the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors after the implementation of the new plan.
B: This choice presents an alternative scenario of a hospital not participating in the plan but still recording a decrease in patient injuries. This information is irrelevant to the argument as it does not relate to the implementation of the plan in the hospitals where the incidence of injuries decreased.
C: This choice weakens the argument, as it suggests the plan may not have captured all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries. If there are staff errors that were not recorded under the plan, the decrease in patient injuries does not necessarily correspond to a decrease in the incidence of staff errors that could have led to such injuries.
D: This choice provides a plausible explanation to link the reduced incidence of patient injuries to the implementation of the plan. By knowing that their errors would be closely monitored, hospital staff became more careful in carrying out their patient-care duties, leading to a decrease in the incidence of errors that caused injuries to patients.
E: This choice is irrelevant to the argument as it does not provide any new information that can help strengthen or weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the plan implemented by several regional hospitals led to a substantial decrease in the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors. The reason for this decrease is attributed to the knowledge of staff members that their errors were being recorded.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument since it focuses on errors that cause life-threatening injuries and it does not provide additional evidence to support the conclusion reached.
B: This statement does not provide a logical explanation for the decrease in incidence of patient injuries in the regional hospitals that implemented the plan.
C: This statement suggests that the recorded data may not be complete and accurate to assess the effectiveness of the plan as it would fail to capture incidents of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
D: If true, this statement demonstrates that the plan's effectiveness was due to the knowledge of staff members that their errors were being recorded and closely analyzed, which supports the argument presented.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument since it does not focus on the effectiveness of the plan in reducing the incidence of patient injuries resulting from staff errors.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The CEO is taking for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. Even though there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, it does not logically follow that such methods will never be developed. This assumption undermines the CEO's argument that their current production methods are the most environmentally responsible. Choice A identifies this flaw by taking note of the CEO's assumption. The other choices do not identify the flaw in the CEO's reasoning.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The CEO is defending the company's environmental record by arguing that they are doing all they can to pollute less and that their current production methods are less polluting than their old methods.
  A: This choice directly addresses the assumption that no methods that do not produce any pollution can be developed.
  B: This choice does not apply to the argument made by the CEO.
  C: This choice addresses the idea that the CEO's argument is too broad and sweeping in its general conclusions based on a specific criticism.
  D: This choice addresses the idea that the CEO assumes success in reducing pollution without providing evidence for such.
  E: This choice addresses the possibility that the CEO is not doing all they can to reduce pollution by ignoring the possibility of production methods that reduce pollution.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The CEO's reasoning assumes that the current production method is the only one that produces less pollution and no other method can produce less pollution than the current method. This is an assumption that ignores the possibility that there may be other production methods that would enable the corporation to produce even less pollution than it currently does. Thus, the reasoning in this argument is flawed because it ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now. Choice "E" is the correct answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The CEO is arguing that they are an environmentally responsible corporation because they are doing all they can to pollute less, and their current production methods pollute less compared to their old methods. They also state that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  A: This choice attacks the CEO assumption that no methods that do not produce pollution can be developed. However, this assumption is not made in the argument.
  B: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This choice attacks the CEO's assumption that because the company has addressed specific criticisms, they must have addressed criticisms in general. This is relevant to the argument.
  D: This choice attacks the CEO assumption that because the company has attempted to reduce pollution, they have succeeded. However, this assumption is not made in the argument.
  E: This choice attacks the CEO's assumption that there are no methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now. This is relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

The CEO's argument assumes that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. This assumption is flawed because it limits the potential for the development of new, innovative methods in the future. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it assumes a limitation that may not exist. The other choices do not accurately describe the flaw in the argument.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The CEO argues that the company is environmentally responsible because they have reduced pollution from their old methods, but there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
A: The argument doesn't take into account that there is the possibility that methods that do not produce any pollution can be developed.
B: The argument doesn't address different causes having similar effects.
C: The argument doesn't generalize too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms.
D: The argument doesn't take for granted that the company has succeeded in reducing pollution.
E: The argument indicates there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The CEO argues that their current production methods pollute less than their previous methods.
  The CEO argues that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  The CEO argues that their company is more environmentally responsible than falsely criticized.
Choices:
  A: This is the opposite of what the CEO argues. The CEO claims there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution but does not take for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed.
  B: This is not addressed in the CEO's argument.
  C: This is somewhat similar to the flaw in the CEO's argument, as he is generalizing too hastily that his company is environmentally responsible and has not addressed other possible criticisms. However, this does not fully capture the flaw in his reasoning.
  D: This is not explicitly stated in the CEO's argument.
  E: This is the flaw in the CEO's argument. The CEO argues that their current production methods pollute less than their previous methods, and there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution, but does not take into account the possibility that there may be different production methods that allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The CEO is defending the corporation against false criticism about not being an environmentally responsible corporation. The CEO argues that the corporation's current production methods pollute significantly less than its old methods did, and that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution. 
A: This option correctly identifies the CEO's flaw in taking for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. However, this argument was not directly made by the CEO. 
B: While it is possible that different causes can have similar effects, this idea is not directly relevant to the CEO's argument. 
C: This option correctly identifies the CEO's flaw in generalizing too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. 
D: This option correctly identifies the CEO's flaw in taking for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded. However, this flaw was not explicitly made by the CEO. 
E: This option correctly identifies the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now, but it does not directly address the flaw in the CEO's argument. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The CEO argues that their current production methods pollute less than their old methods and that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. However, the CEO does not address the possibility of other methods that could produce even less pollution.
  A: This choice correctly identifies a flaw in the CEO's argument. The CEO takes for granted that current pollution levels are the best possible outcome.
  B: This choice describes a flaw relating to cause and effect. Such a flaw is not present in the CEO's argument.
  C: This choice describes a flaw in over-generalization, but the CEO's argument is limited to the topic of environmental responsibility and does not over-generalize.
  D: This choice describes a logical flaw in the CEO assuming that the corporation has completely succeeded in reducing pollution. However, it is not the specific problem discussed in the argument, which relates to current production methods.
  E: This choice accurately identifies a possible flaw in the CEO's argument. However, A is a more accurate depiction of the flaw in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The CEO is defending the corporation against the criticism it has received regarding not being environmentally responsible. The CEO claims that the corporation's current production methods pollute less than its old methods, and there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.

A: The CEO does not address the possibility of production methods that don't produce pollution, so it's not taking it for granted that they cannot be developed.
B: The CEO's argument is not about different causes having similar effects.
C: The CEO is not generalizing hastily but rather is defending the corporation against a specific criticism.
D: The CEO is not assuming that attempting to reduce pollution means that the company has succeeded in doing so.
E: This choice reflects a flaw in the CEO's argument. The CEO's argument does not acknowledge the possibility that the corporation could reduce even more pollution by using currently available methods.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile
  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered
  E: the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Larew argues that the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile, so their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's.
  Mendota disagrees by asserting that the average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
Larew and Mendota disagree about whether Larew's statement about the increase in the percentage of average income of the lowest and highest quintile is accurate or compared to the actual increase in the income of those quintiles.
A: Change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income. This is the central point of disagreement between Larew and Mendota.
B: Change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is not the topic under discussion; rather, the context is which measure (percentage or absolute amount) better describes changes in economic prosperity over time. 
C: Whether or not to compare changes in average income of the lowest quintile to those in the highest quintile is not the focus of the disagreement. 
D: The disagreement is not about whether there were any improvements in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile but how best to measure change over time.
E: This choice accurately summarizes Larew's position; however, it does not reflect the disagreement between the two speakers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: Larew and Mendota are having a disagreement about the relative measurement of the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile compared to the highest quintile. Larew argues that the percentage increase in the average income of the lowest quintile was higher, while Mendota argues that the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
Larew believes that the percentage increase in average income of the lowest quintile was much higher than that of the highest quintile, which indicates they had a higher increase in economic prosperity relative to the highest quintile. Mendota disagrees with this comparison and argues that percentage increase is not an accurate measure of economic prosperity, and the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile. Therefore, Larew and Mendota disagree about whether the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
Response 4:
Knowledge: Larew and Mendota disagree about the comparison of income changes between the lowest and highest quintile.
A: The statement accurately describes the disagreement between the two debaters.
B: This is not the main point of their argument and, therefore, not what they disagree.
C: Both debaters seem to agree that comparisons between quintiles are valuable at times, so this is not part of their disagreement.
D: This is not a disagreement between Larew and Mendota. Both agree that there were improvements in the economic situation of people in the lowest income quintile during the last decade.
E: This statement accurately describes the argument between Larew and Mendota.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Larew thinks that people in the lowest income quintile had a higher percentage of increase in average income than did those in the highest quintile. 
  Mendota disagrees with Larew's claim, but thinks that the absolute increase in average income was greater for the highest quintile.
  
  A: This is a topic of the disagreement, because Larew's argument is based on comparing percentage changes in average income, but Mendota disagrees with it. 
  B: This is somewhat related to their disagreement, but it is not the central point of the disagreement. 
  C: This is not relevant to the topic of the disagreement.
  D: This is not relevant to the topic of the disagreement either, because both Larew and Mendota agree that there was an improvement in the income of the lowest income quintile. 
  E: This is the central topic of the disagreement between Larew and Mendota.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Larew argues that the lowest income quintile had a higher percentage increase in average income than the highest quintile over the last ten years, indicating an increase in their economic prosperity relative to the highest quintile's.
  Mendota disagrees and argues that the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile, indicating that their economic prosperity was increased.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Larew believes that the percentage increase in average income of the lowest quintile was greater than that of the highest quintile, and therefore the economic prosperity of the lowest quintile increased relative to the highest quintile.
  Mendota disagrees with Larew's perspective.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Larew argues that the lowest income quintile had a higher percentage increase in average income than the highest quintile over the last ten years. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's.
  Mendota argues that the average income of the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: Larew believes that people in the lowest income quintile had a higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years compared to those in the highest quintile, hence their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. However, Mendota disagrees by arguing that the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile, despite the percentage increase being lower.
A: Both Larew and Mendota agree on the comparison of percentage changes between the quintiles to measure the change in relative economic prosperity of the lowest quintile compared to the highest.
B: Larew and Mendota disagree on whether the change in economic prosperity should be valued depending on its relationship to the highest income quintile. They, however, agree that comparing relative changes is a good measure of prosperity.
C: Mendota suggests that changes in average income between quintiles can be compared, whereas Larew argues that this is possible to measure relative prosperity. 
D: Mendota disagrees with Larew's claim that the economic situation of individuals in the lowest quintile improved.
E: Larew and Mendota disagree over what measures should be used when determining the relative economic prosperity of individuals in the lowest and highest quintiles. Larew supports using a percentage increase as a measure of prosperity, while Mendota argues that the absolute amount is a better measure.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
Assumptions:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development. --> Out of context, unrelated to the argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. --> If species cannot survive in replacement wetlands, then the argument by the Figorian Wildlife Commission to offset development through construction of replacement wetlands would collapse. So, it is an assumption on which the argument advanced strongly depends.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated. --> out of scope.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife. --> This statement might be true or false, but it doesn't determine whether a regulation on future development needs to be implemented or not. So, it is not a strong assumption on which the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission relies.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.--> This statement might be true or false, but it doesn't determine whether a regulation on future development needs to be implemented or not. So, it is not a strong assumption on which the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission relies.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife, and that development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.
The Figorian Development Commission believes that since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, it should be allowed.  
A: This is irrelevant to the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
B: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission is dependent on this assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
C: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission concerns those nations that have already industrialized and developed wetlands, and hence, this assumption is outside the scope of the argument.
D: This is a statement of fact. It does not help in formulating the argument, but it may be used to support the argument. It does not address any assumptions. 
E: The Figorian Wildlife Commission does not argue that species are more severely threatened than in other areas. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission is that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats in order to protect wildlife. 
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Development Commission is that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and they have as much right to govern their resources as other nations.
A: This option presents a comparison between wetland development and other types of development but does not relate to the argument presented by the Figorian Wildlife Commission or the Figorian Development Commission.
B: This option supports the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission by assuming that replacement wetlands will be able to support indigenous species of natural wetland habitats.
C: This option presents a comparison between industrialized nations and agricultural nations but does not relate to the argument presented by either the Figorian Wildlife Commission or the Figorian Development Commission.
D: This option supports the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission by assuming that Figorian regulation of development has been effective in protecting and preserving wildlife.
E: This option presents a comparison between species that inhabit Figorian wetlands and other endangered species, but it does not relate to the argument presented by either the Figorian Wildlife Commission or the Figorian Development Commission 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect the wildlife.
Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development should be allowed and they have the right to govern their own resources.
A: The argument of Figorian Wildlife Commission does not rely on the assumption that more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
B: This assumption is relevant as the commission argues that regulation and conservation of wetlands are necessary to protect the species and their habitat. If the species do not thrive in replacement wetlands, then the commission's argument would falter.
C: The argument of Figorian Wildlife Commission focuses on industrialized nations, not primarily agricultural ones, so regulation of wetland development in agricultural nations is not directly relevant.
D: This assumption is not mentioned in the argument of Figorian Wildlife Commission but rather seems to be a statement of fact.
E: The argument does not rely on the assumption that the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission is that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats, and that will cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. 

A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is not dependent on the claim that more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development. 
B: This is an assumption that must be made, but it is not on which the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends.
C: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is about Figoria and is not dependent on the claim that in nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
D: This is a possible assumption of the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not stated in the argument.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is dependent on the assumption that the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are severely threatened. However, this specific statement is not necessary.  

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: An assumption is an unstated premise that underlies and supports a conclusion, or the argument as a whole. It is not stated explicitly but is necessary for the conclusion to logically follow from the premises.
A: The argument does not rely on the premise that more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development. This is irrelevant to the argument.
B: This is a necessary assumption for the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, as it assumes that the replacement wetlands will be equal or similar to the natural wetlands, in order to maintain or improve the habitat and well-being of indigenous wildlife.
C: The argument does not rely on the premise that wetland development in nations that are primarily agricultural does not need to be regulated. This is not relevant to the argument in the given context.
D: This statement is an assumption of the Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument, not of the argument advanced by the Figorian Development Commission. It assumes that Figorian regulation of development has indeed protected and preserved wildlife in the past.
E: This information is not relevant to the argument. The argument is focused on the necessity of balancing the development with protecting wildlife and the influence of conservation efforts on Figorian development plans.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission is arguing that to protect wildlife, the development of wetlands must be regulated in Figoria. They propose that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. The Figorian Development Commission argues that wetland development is necessary for growth, and Figoria should be allowed to govern its own resources.
A: The argument does not depend on whether more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
B: This is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends since they propose that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
C: The argument does not depend on whether in nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
D: This is not an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends; it is just a statement about what the Figorian regulation of development has done in the past.
E: The argument does not depend on whether the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission is proposing a solution to offset wetland development in Figoria by constructing replacement wetland habitats.
The Figorian Development Commission is proposing to allow wetland development in order to stimulate growth and to have as much control over their resources as other countries.
Assumptions are unstated premises that support the argument.
 
A: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not mention whether the development of wetlands is the most common way to endanger species. Therefore, whether more species are endangered by wetland development than by any other type of development is irrelevant to the argument.
B: This assumption would support the argument that if wildlife is to be protected, then constructed habitats should successfully harbor the same endangered species as natural habitats. However, the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on this assumption.
C: This answer choice contradicts the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, which argues that development of wetlands in industrialized nations must be regulated to protect wildlife.
D: This assumption would support the argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but it is not necessary for the argument because the argument is based on the assumption of what should be done in the future.
E: The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not rely on the severity of the threat to the species, but rather on the assumption that these creatures need to be protected. Therefore, whether or not these species are among the most severely threatened is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission proposes to regulate wetland development by requiring that any wetlands used for development be replaced with newly constructed wetlands. 
The Figorian Development Commission opposes the regulation, arguing that Figoria needs development and that they have the right to manage their own resources like other nations.
 
A: The argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission is not dependent on whether or not more species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than any other type of development.
B: The argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission is dependent on the assumption that species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
C: The argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not make any assumptions regarding nations that are primarily agricultural and their regulation of wetland development.
D: This statement supports the argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission but is not an assumption on which the argument depends.
E: This statement also supports the argument made by the Figorian Wildlife Commission, but is not an assumption on which the argument depends.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that to protect wildlife we must regulate wetland development in Figoria by offsetting future wetland development with the construction of replacement wetlands.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, they should allow development and have as much right to govern their own resources as other countries have.
  
  A: This information is not provided in the passage and is unrelated to the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
  B: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that replacement wetlands would be sufficient to protect the species that inhabit natural wetlands. Therefore, if we assume that species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, the argument's conclusion becomes plausible. 
  C: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission applies specifically to industrialized nations and their wetland development. Therefore, information regarding agricultural nations is unrelated to the argument.
  D: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission suggests that their regulation of development would protect wildlife. Thus, it is not an assumption on which the argument depends, but rather a supporting premise.
  E: The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission does not depend on whether the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened or not.

  E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The city of Gastner built a new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area in order to relieve traffic congestion. 
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  
  A: This option suggests that most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner are commuters from one of the city's suburbs. This information is somewhat relevant, but it does not directly explain the increase in commute time. 
  
  B: This option states that the location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from the Gastner's largest suburbs. This statement is also not directly related to the increase of average commute time. 
  
  C: This option suggests that some suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights soon after the new highway was opened. This information directly explains the increase in average commute time, as the upgrading of those roads may have caused a bottleneck, increasing traffic congestion and causing longer travel times for commuters. 
  
  D: This option talks about road repair work being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner. However, it does not directly explain the increase in average commute time. 
  
  E: This option suggests that traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened, which is a direct factor that likely contributed to the increased average commute time.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The building of highways usually aims to decongest traffic jams and reduce average commuting time.
  However, it is possible for traffic congestion to increase after the construction of highway due to some factors.
  
A: This option does not provide a clear explanation of why average commute time for downtown workers increased after the construction of the highway. 

B: If most people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs use the new highway, it potentially implies that there is an exacerbated congestion on the highway, leading to increased average commute time for downtown workers.

C: If several suburban roads linking to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights, it implies that increased wait times could occur while on the road leading to longer commute times for downtown workers.

D: This option does provide an alternate explanation for why the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway was opened.

E: If traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened it implies that the new highway is causing traffic congestion in the downtown area leading to longer commute times.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The city built a new highway to link several of the city's suburbs and downtown area.
  The average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway was opened.
Option A: This information does not help to explain why the average commute time for workers in the downtown area of Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
Option B: This supports the idea that the new highway has increased traffic congestion for downtown because the location of the new highway is convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs
Option C: This suggests that traffic flow in the suburban roads might have been improved leading to more traffic flowing into the new highway which increased congestion in downtown Gastner.
Option D: This information is not directly related to the new highway, and it does not help to explain why the average commute time for workers in the downtown area of Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
Option E: This information suggests that the new highway might have caused more congestion in downtown Gastner.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The city of Gastner built a new highway to relieve traffic congestion.
  The new highway links several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area.
  After the new highway opened, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased.
  
A: This option provides a fact that implies that the new highway should have reduced the commute time of workers coming from the suburbs to downtown. 
B: This option provides a possible reason for why the new highway may be causing an increase in urban commute times. If the new highway is located in such a way that people who do not live in downtown Gastner, but in the largest suburbs, are benefiting the most then this could account for the increase in commute time for those who work downtown.
C: The stoplights may have created additional congestion on the roads surrounding the new highway, but it does not help to explain why the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased.
D: This option seems to suggest that the road repair work was being done at the same time as the new highway construction. It does not provide an explanation as to why the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased.
E: This option suggests that the new highway has led to more congestion on the roads near the downtown area after the highway opened. This option most helps to explain why the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased, since if the new highway has led to more cars getting into downtown then this could have a knock-on effect on permanent residents or workers.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The city of Gastner built a new highway to link several suburbs to the downtown area. 
  After the new highway was opened, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased.
  
A: This fact doesn't explain why the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway was opened.
  
B: If the people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs began using the new highway, this could have contributed to the increase in the average commute time, because these people would have contributed to the traffic.
  
C: If suburban roads connected to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights, this may have slowed down traffic, which could have contributed to the increase in the average commute time.
  
D: Although some road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner, this doesn't fully explain why the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway was opened.
  
E: If the traffic on roads near the new highway in Gastner's downtown area became more congested after the new highway was opened, this could have contributed to the increase in the average commute time.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The new highway in Gastner was built to relieve traffic congestion.
  The average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the opening of the new highway.
  A: This option suggests that people who work in downtown Gastner mostly commute from the suburbs, but this doesn't explain why the average commute time has increased.
  B: If the location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs, then the increase in average commute time could be because more people are using this highway, which could lead to congestion in the downtown area.
  C: The upgrade with new stoplights of suburban roads connecting to the new highway might affect people who live in the suburbs, but it does not necessarily explain why average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased.
  D: This option talks about road work being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner at the same time that the new highway was being built, but this doesn't help explain why the average commute time has increased.
  E: This option could explain the increase in average commute time if traffic on the roads near the new highway became more congested after the opening of the new highway. More congestion near the highway could lead to longer commute times for people coming from the suburbs that are linked via the new highway. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The city of Gastner built a new highway to relieve traffic congestion and it linked several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area. However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.

A: This statement alone does not explain the increase in average commute time. However, this statement supports the claim that the new highway may have been built primarily for the convenience of commuters from the suburbs and not for the benefit of everyone in the city.
B: This statement alone does not explain the increase in average commute time. However, this statement supports the claim that the new highway may have been built primarily for the convenience of commuters from the suburbs and not for the benefit of everyone in the city.
C: This statement alone does not explain the increase in average commute time. In fact, it suggests that the upgrade of several suburban roads was done to mitigate the potential increase in congestion caused by the new highway.
D: This statement alone does not explain the increase in average commute time. It suggests that the road repair work may be an additional factor contributing to the traffic congestion, but it does not explain why the new highway led to an increase in average commute time.
E: This statement provides a plausible explanation for why the average commute time increased after the new highway opened. It suggests that the new highway may have diverted traffic from other downtown roads to the roads near the new highway, leading to increased congestion in the downtown area.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The statement has established that the new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area has increased commute time for workers in downtown Gastner. The question is asking to explain why this happened.
  A: This statement implies that many people working in the downtown area use the new highway, and therefore its construction likely increased or redirected the traffic.
  B: This statement indicates that the location of the new highway meets the route taken by many commuters, which could explain the increase in traffic.
  C: This statement's content is irrelevant because it doesn't account for the new highway's impact on downtown traffic.
  D: Construction or repair work could have contributed to the traffic congestion impacting downtown Gastner's commuters.
  E: This gives an explanation that's redundant, as it repeats the initial premise that the traffic congestion in the downtown area has become more congested after the new highway's launch. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The city of Gastner built a new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area.
  The average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
A: This option simply restates the fact in the context and does not explain the reason behind the increase in average commute time.
  B: This option suggests that people commuting to and from Gastner's largest suburbs started using the new highway, but does not address why average commute time still increased.
  C: This option implies that the newly upgraded suburban roads could have resulted in more traffic lights, which could have slowed down the overall flow of traffic.
  D: This option suggests that the road repair work may have also resulted in some congestion and delays in the downtown area.
  E: This option explains that the traffic became more congested after the new highway opened. This could be due to increased traffic on the roads near the new highway.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about a situation where it is believed that someone has polluted a river, but there is not enough evidence to identify the polluter with sufficient certainty to impose a severe penalty. The question asks which principle can help justify this reasoning.
  A: This choice directly relates to the argument, stating that the more severe a penalty is, the more certainty is required to impose it. This aligns with the reasoning of the argument.
  B: This choice mentions that a penalty should deter people from committing the crime, but this does not directly relate to the argument or the reasoning presented.
  C: This choice mentions that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused, but this doesn't directly address the situation described in the argument.
  D: This choice states that severe penalties may discourage someone from admitting responsibility, but this doesn't provide justification for the reasoning in the argument.
  E: This choice opposes the reasoning of the argument and does not provide any justification for it. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument suggests that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe and that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, they cannot be certain enough to justify imposing the penalty. 
  A: This principle is exactly what the argument rejects. Instead of imposing the penalty, they are waiting for stronger evidence or confession before taking action.
  B: This principle is not mentioned in the argument or relevant to the reasoning presented.
  C: This principle is relevant but does not help justify the reasoning presented. The argument is not about adjusting the penalty on the basis of the harm caused; it is about being uncertain of who caused the pollution because the penalty is severe.
  D: This principle is not mentioned in the argument or relevant to the reasoning presented.
  E: This is the best answer as it captures the main idea in the argument and the concern for being sufficiently certain of guilt before imposing a severe penalty.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument suggests that the penalty for pollution should be imposed only if there is sufficient evidence or if the perpetrator admits the responsibility.
  A: This principle argues that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of guilt to impose it. This helps to justify the reasoning in the argument, by suggesting that it is reasonable to refrain from imposing a penalty when sufficient evidence is not available or the perpetrator does not admit responsibility.
  B: This principle argues that penalties should be severe enough to deter people from committing a crime, but not too severe. This principle is not directly related to the justification for the argument.
  C: This principle argues that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction. This principle is not directly related to the justification for the argument.
  D: This principle argues that severe penalties are likely to discourage someone from coming forward and admitting responsibility for their offense. Although this statement may be true, it is not related to the justification for the argument.
  E: This principle argues that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it is impossible to justify punishment when guilt cannot be proven. While this principle may be true, it is not directly related to the justification for the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument states that the identity of the polluter cannot be determined with sufficient certainty to justify imposition of a severe penalty. 
A: This principle matches the argument that more certainty is required when a more severe penalty is at stake. 
B: This principle is not relevant to the reasoning in the argument.
C: This principle is related to the severity of the penalty but does not directly account for the certainty required to impose the penalty. 
D: This principle gives reason to believe the perpetrator is less likely to admit responsibility when the penalty is severe, but does not address the justification for imposition of the penalty. 
E: This principle directly matches the argument that a penalty so severe that guilt cannot be determined with sufficient certainty cannot be justifiably imposed.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument is discussing how severe penalties for pollution require stronger evidence before justified and that without such evidence or admission of guilt, the polluter cannot be penalized.  
A: This answer supports the reasoning in the argument that the more severe the penalty, the higher the requirement for certainty before imposing the penalty.
B: This answer is discussing penalties and how they should be severe enough to deter people from committing crimes, but not too severe. The argument is not discussing the appropriate level of severity for penalties.
C: This answer provides a general principle for penalties based on the harm done, but it does not specifically address the issue of certainty required for imposing a penalty.
D: This answer suggests that severe penalties would discourage people from admitting guilt; however, this does not address the reasoning in the argument.
E: This answer supports the argument's position that penalties should not be so severe that there can never be sufficient certainty to justify punishment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument discusses the severity of the penalty for pollution. 
  A: This principle suggests that the severity of a penalty should correspond to the level of evidence implicating the accused party.
  B: This principle addresses the severity of penalties generally, and is not directly applicable to the argument.
  C: This principle suggests that the severity of a penalty should correspond to the scale of harm caused, which is not directly relevant to the argument.
  D: This principle addresses the likelihood of a confession, and is not directly relevant to the argument.
  E: This principle corresponds closely with the argument, suggesting that the severity of a penalty should not exceed the level of certainly about the identity of the offender.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The argument is that there is not sufficient evidence to impose severe penalty due to uncertainty of the identification of the party responsible. It acknowledges that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
A: The principle in this choice argues that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of an offender's guilt before imposing the penalty. This supports the argument in the passage and therefore, is the best answer choice.
B: This principle is about the balancing of penalty severity to maximise its deterrence effect without rendering one unwilling to impose the penalty. This is not relevant to the argument in question.
C: This principle states that the severity of the penalty for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction, which is not relevant to the argument.
D: This principle is unrelated to the argument as it discusses the probability of someone admitting responsibility for an offense.
E: This principle emphasizes the need of having sufficiently certain evidence before punishing an offender, and supports the argument in the passage. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument discusses a situation where the severity of the penalty for an infraction may not be justified without sufficient evidence or admission of responsibility. 
  A: This principle reflects the idea mentioned in the argument that a more severe penalty requires stronger evidence of guilt.
  B: This principle discusses the balance between the severity of penalties and their ability to deter crime, but it does not directly relate to the argument presented.
  C: This principle argues that the severity of a penalty should be proportional to the harm caused, but it does not address the issue of insufficient evidence or identity of the culprit.
  D: This principle argues that a severe penalty may deter admission of responsibility, but it does not address the issue of insufficient evidence or identity of the culprit.
  E: This principle is most directly related to the argument presented, as it argues against imposing a penalty unless there is sufficient evidence or admission of responsibility to justify it. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument talks about a situation where they suspect someone, but the penalty is too severe to be imposed without strong evidence or admission of responsibility. It suggests that there needs to be some degree of certainty of guilt before imposing the penalty. 
A: This option, if true, supports the reasoning in the argument by stating that a more severe penalty requires greater certainty of guilt before imposing it. 
B: This option talks about the general principle for determining penalties, but it is not particularly relevant to the justification of the argument. 
C: This option talks about the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction, but it is not particularly relevant to the justification of the argument.  
D: This option suggests that the severity of the penalty may discourage the perpetrator from admitting their responsibility, but it is not particularly relevant to the justification of the argument. 
E: This option, if true, supports the reasoning in the argument by stating that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
The argument is discussing the difficulty in justifying imposing a severe penalty for pollution caused by a party without having stronger evidence to support the guilt of that party. 
A: This answer validates the reasoning of the argument by stating that the more severe the penalty, the higher the standard of evidence required to justify imposing such a penalty. 
B: This answer relates to the ideal balance between deterrence and punishment, but it does not directly address the issue of evidence required to impose a penalty for a specific offense. 
C: This answer deals with the principle of proportional punishment, but it doesn't pertain to the specific concern being discussed in the argument. 
D: This answer is suggesting that a severe penalty would decrease the likelihood that the offender would admit to the crime, but it doesn't help justify the reasoning in the argument. 
E: This answer aligns with the argument's reasoning by stating that a penalty should be severe enough to warrant punishment but not so severe that it can't be supported by sufficient evidence.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist is opposing the proposal of using extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam, which the government-owned water utility received approval for.
  A: This principle might be important for ensuring transparency, but it does not necessarily help justify the columnist's opposition to the legislator's proposal.
  B: This principle supports the idea that money intended for a project that benefits the entire community like building the dam should not be diverted to something that only benefits a few members like building roads.
  C: This principle supports the idea that the additional charge for water bills should not be used to fund a project, most of the customers are against, in this case, building roads instead of a dam.
  D: This principle is about who can approve an additional charge on water bills, and it is not directly related to the proposal to use the extra revenue for building roads instead of a dam.
  E: This principle is about how the water utility should prioritize its expenditures, but it does not necessarily help justify the columnist's position on the legislator's proposal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - The columnist believes that spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam is unacceptable.
 
A: This principle of rights is not directly relevant to the question of whether the legislator's proposal is acceptable or unacceptable.
  B: This principle does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable, as it assumes that building new roads instead of a dam would only benefit some members of the community.
  C: This principle supports the idea that the money collected from customers should not be used for a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of. However, the question does not provide any information about whether the majority of the customers approve or disapprove of building the dam.
  D: This principle is not directly relevant to the question of whether the legislator's proposal is acceptable or unacceptable.
  E: This principle is not directly relevant to the question of whether the legislator's proposal is acceptable or unacceptable.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The columnist thinks that the proposal to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam is unacceptable. 
  The legislator's proposal is not aligning with the water utility's goal to build a dam and using the extra money for that purpose.
A: Customers' right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used is irrelevant to the current situation since no evidence has been provided to suggest there is a lack of transparency.
B: This principle is consistent with the columnist's judgment as an additional charge on water bills is meant to benefit the entire community, and building roads would not achieve the primary proposed benefits of building a dam.
C: There is no information that supports the claim that most of the utility's customers disapprove of the dam project.
D: The addition of the charge was already approved by relevant authorities, and the proposal to use it for road construction instead of building a dam is a different issue from the authorization of the charge. 
E: This principle is somewhat related to the current situation but is not the most relevant principle to determine whether the legislator's proposal is acceptable or not. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal to build new roads instead of a dam using the extra money from water bills is unacceptable.
Option A: This principle is not enough to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
Option B: This principle, although relevant and important, is not enough to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
Option C: This principle is less relevant than option B since the utility's customers may not have a say on how the utility decides to spend its money.
Option D: This principle is not relevant to the topic since the approval for an additional charge on water bills has already been granted.
Option E: This principle is relevant to the topic since the extra money collected from water bills must be used for water-related expenditures.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
   - The columnist thinks that the legislator's proposal of using extra money from water bills to build new roads is unacceptable.
   - One of the listed principles must help justify the columnist's judgment.
A: This principle says that the customers have the right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used. This principle does not directly help justify the columnist's judgment about the proposal to use extra money from water bills to build new roads.
B: This principle says that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community. This principle could help justify the columnist's judgment about the proposal as building new roads only benefits a certain section of the community instead of the community as a whole.
C: This principle says that an additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of. This principle does not directly help justify the columnist's judgment about the proposal to use extra money from water bills to build new roads.
D: This principle says that an additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature. This principle does not directly help justify the columnist's judgment about the proposal to use extra money from water bills to build new roads.
E: This principle says that a water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures. This principle could help justify the columnist's judgment about the proposal as using extra money from water bills to build roads is not related to water-related expenditures.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  A: This principle supports the idea of transparency and knowing how the money is being used, but it does not directly apply to the situation at hand.
  B: This principle supports the idea of using the money for the benefit of the entire community instead of only a part of it, but it does not directly apply to the situation at hand.
  C: This principle directly addresses the issue of funding a project that most customers disapprove of, which is the building of the dam. 
  D: This principle refers to the process of approving an additional charge on water bills, but it is not directly related to the question at hand, which is how the additional revenue should be used.
  E: This principle refers to the appropriate use of the additional charge, but it is not directly related to the question at hand, which is how the revenue should be used.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam.
  -A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam, but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.
  - The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  
A: This principle is not relevant as it talks about a customer's right to know how their money is being used rather than how the money should be used.
  B: This principle is relevant as the proposal diverts funds from a project that would benefit the entire community to a project that only benefits some members.
  C: This principle is relevant as it proposes that funds should not be used for a project that the majority of customers are against.
  D: This principle is not relevant as it talks about the legislative approval of an additional charge on water bills, which has already been granted.
  E: This principle is not relevant as it only talks about what water utility can use the collected additional charge for.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist opposes the legislator's proposal to spend the extra money from water bills to build new roads rather than building a dam using the additional revenue collected by a government-owned water utility.

Knowledge: 
  Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills to build a dam.
  Legislator: Proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.
  A: This principle is related to financial transparency, but it does not justify the columnist's judgment on the legislator's proposal.
  B: This principle supports the idea that money designated for projects that benefit the entire community, such as building a dam for water supply, should not be used for other types of projects, such as building roads.
  C: This principle is reasonable but does not justify the columnist's judgment, as it assumes most utility customers disapprove of the dam project, about which there is no mention.
  D: This principle is not relevant to the current situation since it refers to the approval of new charges, not the use of existing ones.
  E: This principle suggests that a water utility should only collect additional charges if the money collected is used for water-related expenditures, such as building a dam for water supply. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal, to use the extra money collected by a water utility, from an additional charge on water bills, to build new roads instead of a dam, is unacceptable.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The Florida panther is an endangered species of cougar that lives in the swamps and forests of southern Florida.
  - The current population of Florida panthers is between 70 to 100 individuals.
  - In order for the Florida panther population to be self-sustaining, it must reach at least 250 individuals.
  - The current habitat is not large enough to support any more Florida panthers.
  
Answer: 
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining. 
  Explanation: The statements in the passage say that the current population of Florida panthers is too small to be self-sustaining, and that their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that unless the Florida panthers are given more habitat, their population will not be able to grow to the size required for self-sustainability.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Florida panthers population has increased moderately but is still less than required for self-sustenance. 
  The current panther habitat cannot support more of these animals.
Choices:
  A: This statement is a possibility, but it has not been mentioned in the context or inferred from it.
  B: The given information does not support this statement. 
  C: This statement directly follows from the information given in the context. 
  D: This statement is not supported by the information given in the context. 
  E: The given information implies the opposite of this statement - that the habitat of Florida panthers is smaller now than it was in the 1970s. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- There are currently 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today.
- This represents an increase from their numbers in the 1970s.
- At least 250 panthers are needed for a self-sustaining population.
- The current habitat is not large enough to support more panthers.

A: The statement that "some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality" is a possibility, but it is not a necessary conclusion from the information given.
B: The statement that "if the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining" is untrue. The passage states that at least 250 panthers are needed for self-sustainability.
C: The statement that "unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining" is congruent with the given information that the current habitat is not large enough to support more panthers.
D: The statement that "the population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level" is not supported by the given information, which states that the panther population has increased from its numbers in the 1970s but that self-sustainability requires at least 250 panthers.
E: The statement that "today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s" is not supported by the given information. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The Florida panther population has increased significantly over time but their population needs to reach at least 250 in order to be self-sustaining.
  - The panther's current habitat cannot support anymore of these animals.
  
A: The size of the panthers' current habitat is mentioned, but its quality is not discussed.
  B: The statement is the opposite of what is established before, that is, the population needs to at least be 250 in order to be self-sustaining.
  C: This statement correctly restates what is provided in the context that the current habitat is not sufficient to support any more panthers.
  D: The context neither states nor implies that the population is at its limits.
  E: The context does not provide any evidence that Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Florida panthers are an endangered species that require at least 250 individuals for their population to be self-sustaining.
  There are currently 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. 
  The panthers' current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.

Analysis:
  Option A is a possibility, but it is not necessarily true based on the information provided.
  Option B is incorrect, as the statement in the passage only states that the population must reach 250 to be self-sustaining.
  Option C is consistent with the information provided in the passage.
  Option D contradicts the information in the passage that states the population has increased from the 1970s.
  Option E is not supported by the information provided in the passage.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The number of Florida panthers alive is 70 to 100.
  - The current habitat of Florida panthers is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  - The population of Florida panthers must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.

A: There is no information given in the passage that indicates whether any part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
B: The passage does not say that the population of Florida panthers will become self-sustaining if it ever exceeds 250.
C: The passage states that the population of Florida panthers will not be self-sustaining if it does not acquire a larger habitat.
D: The passage does not state that the population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
E: There is no information given in the passage that compares the size of the habitat currently occupied by Florida panthers to the size of their habitat in the 1970s.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The Florida panther denotes the Puma concolor coryi (Puma), a subspecies of the North American cougar, with an estimated population of 70-100 individuals.
  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is the agency responsible for the management, conservation, and protection of panthers in Florida.
  A: It is not explicitly stated in the passage whether some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality. There is no evidence to support this choice.
  B: The passage only states that the panther's population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining, but it does not say that if the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true and cannot be the answer.
  C: The passage establishes that the current habitat is too small to support any more florida panthers and that their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Therefore, unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be able to reach the self-sustaining number of at least 250. This must be true.
  D: The passage indicates that the population of Florida panthers was very low in the 1970s but that it has increased significantly since then. It does not suggest that the population will not increase beyond current levels. Thus, this statement is not necessarily true and cannot be the answer.
  E: The passage does not provide information to support or refute this choice.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today.
  - This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s.
  - The population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  - Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.

Answer: 
  If the population were to exceed 250, it would still not be self-sustaining as the current habitat is not large enough to support more. Therefore, "If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining" is not true. 
  A: there is no information provided to infer that their habitat is of marginal quality.
  B: False.
  C: True.
  D: there is no information provided to infer that the population will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: This is not true, as the passage suggests that their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the status of the Florida panther and its population size.
  A: The passage mentions that the current habitat is not large enough to support more panthers, but it does not say whether any part of the habitat is of marginal quality.
  B: The passage only indicates that the population must be at least 250 for it to be self-sustaining, but it does not state that exceeding this number will necessarily guarantee self-sustainability.
  C: The passage explicitly states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers, and that the population must reach at least 250 for it to be self-sustaining.
  D: The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that the population of Florida panthers will never increase beyond its current level; in fact, it suggests that the population has already significantly increased over the past few decades.
  E: The passage does not provide any information about the size of the panthers' habitat in the 1970s or today.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The Florida panther population has increased over the years but must reach at least 250 for it to be self-sustaining.
  The current habitat of the panthers cannot support any more of them.
  
A: The statement may be true, but it is not necessarily required by the given information.
B: This statement contradicts the given information. The population needs to reach at least 250 in order to be self-sustaining.
C: This statement accurately summarizes the given information.

  The passage does not state or imply that only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The context discusses the primary function of epic poetry. It is stated that this function is accomplished through the presentation of heroic figures as role models, rather than through explicit discussion of values.
  A: The professor does not say that this is true of all poetry; it is specific to epic poetry.
  B: This statement accurately summarizes the professor's argument.
  C: The professor states that values are not set forth explicitly in epic poetry. However, there is no discussion of how often values are set forth explicitly in poetry outside of the context of epic poetry.
  D: The professor suggests that this is true of at least some groups of people who hear epic poetry.

  The professor's viewpoint is that the primary function of epic poetry is to transmit values by presenting heroic figures as role models who embody those values. Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  A: The statement is similar to the professor's viewpoint, but it is not limited to epic poetry or role models. It is too broad.
  B: This statement precisely summarizes the professor's viewpoint that epic poems transmit values by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  C: This statement is inferred from the first statement made by the professor: "This transmission is accomplished not by an explicit discussion of those values…" 
  D: This statement is consistent with the professor's viewpoint. The statement underscores that the heroic figures serve as role models for the people embodying the values by which they are to live.
  E: This statement is not true, as other forms of poetry could also present heroic figures as role models that, if imitated, give meaning and direction.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
- The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by which a group of people is to live.
- The professor suggests the transmission of these values is accomplished by embodying them in heroic figures, who are presented as role models.
- He asserts that imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.

A: The statement reflects the idea that poetry gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who read or hear it. However, it does not fully reflect the professor's argument about the most important function of epic poetry specifically.
B: The statement correctly describes the main argument made by the professor about how epic poems transmit values to their audience.
C: The professor argues that values are presented in poetic works not by explicit discussions about those values, but rather by embodying them in heroic figures.
D: The idea reflected in this statement is consistent with the professor's argument, which suggests that heroic figures can serve as role models embodying the values that people are to live by.
E: This statement is not true, as it does not account for the potential for other types of literature besides epic poetry to present role models that provide meaning and direction. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The statements made by the professor suggest that:
  - The most important function of epic poetry is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live.
  - Epic poetry transmits these values by embodying those values in heroic figures presented as role models.
  - Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.

A: This choice expresses a generalized concept about poetry and its function, but it does not necessarily follow from the professor's statements. Therefore, we cannot select this choice as the answer.
B: This choice accurately restates the professor's argument that epic poetry accomplishes its most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
C: This choice correctly paraphrases the professor's argument that values are transmitted implicitly, through the embodiment of those values in heroic figures, rather than through explicit discussion.
D: This choice accurately restates the professor's argument that heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
E: This choice makes an incorrect assertion that only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models that give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear it.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The professor states that epic poetry's most important function is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live through the embodiment of the values in heroic figures, who are presented as role models. The professor explains that imitation of those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.

  A: It is possible that an important function of poetry is to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it. However, this statement is not necessarily inferred from the given context.
  
  B: The statement is true according to the professor's explanation of how epic poetry functions to transmit values through heroic figures presented as role models. It is a valid inference from the given context.

  C: The professor does state that values are not explicitly discussed but rather embodied in heroic figures to serve as role models. However, the statement that values are "rarely if ever" represented explicitly is an exaggeration and not an accurate inference from the given context.

  D: This statement is a valid inference from the professor's explanation of how epic poetry functions to transmit values through heroic figures presented as role models.
  
  E: This statement is not true since it is possible for other forms of poetry or literature to present heroic figures as role models.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by which a group of people is to live. This is accomplished not by an explicit discussion of those values, but rather by the embodiment of those values in heroic figures who are presented as role models. Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  
A: The statement is consistent with the argument made by the professor, but it is not a necessary inference from it.
  
B: The statement accurately reflects the argument made by the professor, which is that epic poems present heroic figures as role models and that the transmission of values is accomplished through such heroes.
  
C: Although the professor does argue that values are embodied in the heroic figures of epic poems, it is not necessary to infer that those values are rarely if ever set forth explicitly in poetry more generally.
 
D: The statement accurately reflects the argument made by the professor, which is that heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which the group of people is to live.
 
E: This statement is contradicted by the professor's argument. The professor never suggests that only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models. 
Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that a majority of people who switch their auto insurance coverage to Popelka could save hundreds of dollars.
  A: The argument discusses the average savings of the policyholders who switched to Popelka but fails to consider that some policyholders may have saved less or none at all.
  B: The argument does not make any assumptions or statements about policyholders who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: The argument fails to consider that other insurance companies may offer even greater savings than Popelka.
  D: The argument does not make any assumptions about policyholders who underestimated how much they saved by switching to Popelka. 
  E: The argument does not make any assumptions or statements about the demographic characteristics of the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  A: This choice raises the possibility that not all policyholders saved money by switching to Popelka, and the advertisement does not consider that.
  B: This choice reviews the prices of new and old policyholders. This topic is out of context since the claim is about new policyholders, and this choice doesn't criticize the argument.
  C: This option proposes a possibility; however, it is beyond the scope of the given argument since it talks about the possibility of switching to another insurance company, not Popelka.
  D: This choice talks about underestimating the savings, but the advertisement does not seem to take that for granted or provide any evidence supporting that claim.
  E: This choice proposes that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders, This possibility may decrease the credibility of the conclusion drawn, which is unrelated to the people being disproportionately represented among policyholders.
Action: Answer('A')
Response 2:
Knowledge: The advertisement claims that a survey of a sample of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. The advertisement concludes by suggesting that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.

A: This is a relevant criticism but does not make the argument itself vulnerable. The survey could still be accurate for the majority of the respondents even if some reported saving less or nothing at all.  

B: The argument does not rely on the assumption that new and experienced customers have the same premium. 

C: The argument acknowledges the possibility of saving more money by changing insurance companies but claims that switching to Popelka is enough to save money.

D: The argument doesn't rely on the assumption that few people underestimated how much they saved when they switched their insurance coverage to Popelka.

E: The argument fails to address the possibility of the sample's representativeness and demographics of the population switching to Popelka.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument is based on a survey of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders, who reported savings of $250 on average.
  A: This choice suggests that some new customers may not have saved any money when they switched to Popelka, but the argument makes no claim about all new customers saving money.
  B: This is not a vulnerability of the argument, since the argument is focused on new customers who switched to Popelka and saved money.
  C: This choice suggests that there may be other insurance companies that offer even greater savings than Popelka, but the argument never claims that Popelka is the only option for cost savings.
  D: This choice suggests that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders may have overestimated how much money they saved, but the argument is not based on whether the customers accurately reported their savings.
  E: This choice suggests that the survey only represents a subset of people who would benefit from switching to Popelka, but the argument does not claim to be based on a representative sample of the population.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, the advertisement concludes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  A: This is a possible criticism of the argument because the result may not be representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders. However, it does not necessarily weaken the argument that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  B: This is not a criticism of the argument because the advertisement does not make any assumption about the average auto insurance premiums paid by new versus old Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  C: This is a possible criticism of the argument because the advertisement only suggests that switching to Popelka would result in savings, without comparing these potential savings to those of other insurance companies.
  D: This is not a criticism of the argument because the advertisement has no claims about underestimation.
  E: This is a possible criticism of the argument. If the people who could save hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders, then the advertisement's conclusion that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the advertisement is based on a survey conducted on the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders, who reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. 
  A: This possibility may weaken the argument. However, the advertisement isn't based on the new policyholders who reported little or no savings. It is based on average savings of $250.
  B: This statement isn't related to the argument presented in the advertisement.
  C: This possibility may be true, but it doesn't weaken the argument that most people can save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka, as per the survey conducted. Moreover, the advertisement focuses on the savings that policyholders can achieve by switching to Popelka, not to some other insurance company.
  D: The advertisement doesn't assume this statement. It merely presents the average savings reported by the new policyholders surveyed.
  E: This statement may weaken the argument to some extent as it is possible that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Action: Answer ("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders saved $250 a year on average by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  A: This option asserts that some of the new policyholders might have saved little or no money when they switched to Popelka, but the argument in the advertisement is based on the average savings of the sample representative.
  B: This option introduces a new idea about the auto insurance policies, but it is not relevant to the argument presented in the advertisement.
  C: This option presents an alternative possibility to the argument in the advertisement, but it doesn't show that the argument is vulnerable to criticism on any specific grounds.
  D: This option speculates on the possibility of underestimation, which is not directly relevant to the argument in the advertisement.
  E: This option challenges the representativeness of the sample used in the survey, which is a valid criticism on the advertisement's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. The advertisement further claims that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.  
A: This statement is valid. It is possible that some new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: The statement in the advertisement does not assume that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay, on average, the same amount as the older policyholders.
  C: The statement in the advertisement does not address the possibility that other insurance companies could help people save more money than Popelka.
  D: The statement in the advertisement does not consider that some new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: The statement in the advertisement does not fail to address the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, suggesting that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could similarly save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
A: This criticism is plausible since the average savings reported by some customers are still only an average and some customers may have reported little or no savings when they switched to Popelka. Hence, the conclusion that most people can save hundreds of dollars by switching may not be accurate if those who did not report savings are a significant proportion of all policyholders surveyed.
B: The argument does not make any assumption about whether new policyholders pay more or less than long-term policyholders for their auto insurance.
C: This criticism is plausible since the argument does not consider the possibility that there may be other insurance providers besides Popelka who could offer even better deals.
D: The argument does not assume that customers' estimates of the amount they saved are correct or incorrect.
E: This criticism is not relevant, since the argument is not making any claim about the demographic characteristics of customers who switched to Popelka.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. The advertisement concludes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
A: This choice identifies a possibility that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. However, the advertisement's argument is not refuted by this possibility alone.
B: This choice identifies a possibility that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay more for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time. However, the advertisement's argument is not refuted by this possibility alone.
C: This choice identifies a possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. However, the advertisement's argument can still be true if the second most affordable option still costs significantly more than Popelka.
E: This choice identifies a possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. However, this possibility does not undermine the argument made in the advertisement.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  A: The effectiveness and safety of the treatment to reduce bilirubin levels in newborns is irrelevant to the position of the second group of doctors.
  B: This choice supports the position of the second group of doctors because it gives an example of a situation where the brain's natural defenses are weakened, which would make it more likely for bilirubin to enter the brain.
  C: This choice is irrelevant to the position of the second group of doctors because it talks about where bilirubin occurs, not whether or not high levels of bilirubin are dangerous.
  D: This choice is irrelevant to the position of the second group of doctors since it talks about a potential benefit of bilirubin, rather than the danger of high levels of bilirubin.
  E: This choice is also irrelevant to the position of the second group of doctors since it talks about the level of bilirubin (which is not the issue), rather than the danger of high levels of bilirubin.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The second group of doctors argue for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  A: The effectiveness of a treatment does not relate to the position of the second group of doctors.
  B: This statement supports the position of the second group of doctors, suggesting that weakening of the natural defenses may allow bilirubin to enter the brain.
  C: This statement provides information regarding the pigments in newborns, but it does not relate to the position of the second group of doctors. 
  D: The statement provides information regarding bilirubin, but it does not relate to the position of the second group of doctors.
  E: The agreement or disagreement among doctors regarding the threshold level for the treatment of bilirubin does not relate to the position of the second group of doctors. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The first group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. 
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  
A: This statement, though relevant to the context, supports neither the argument of the first group nor does it help the second group of doctors in establishing their argument. 
B: This statement supports the position of the second group, as if the natural defenses of the brains are weakened, bilirubin may enter the brain causing dangers tetanus. 
C: This statement mentions another fact about bilirubin and its existence, however, it does not support any of the groups. 
D: This statement may be relevant information, but it does not support any of the groups' arguments. 
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument of both groups, as it only talks about agreement on the levels of bilirubin. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The second group of doctors is arguing for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering the brain.
  A: The efficacy and safety of the treatment for reducing bilirubin levels is not relevant to the argument regarding the brain's natural defenses.
  B: This statement supports the argument of the second group of doctors, providing a reason why it might be safe to allow bilirubin levels to remain high.
  C: The location of bilirubin in newborn babies is not relevant to the argument regarding the brain's natural defenses.
  D: While it is true that bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed, this does not support the argument of the second group of doctors regarding the brain's natural defenses.
  E: This fact does not support either group of doctors in their positions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin whereas the other group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
A: This information is related to the treatment that reduces high bilirubin in newborns, but it doesn't provide additional support for the position of the second group of doctors.
B: If some diseases can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, then it would support the position of the second group of doctors, who argue that bilirubin levels in newborn babies should remain high because the brain has natural defenses against it.
C: This information is not relevant to the position of either group of doctors. 
D: This information is not directly related to the position of either group of doctors. 
E: This information is not relevant to the position of either group of doctors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
A: The effectiveness and negative side-effects of bilirubin treatment is not relevant to the position of the second group of doctors. 
B: This choice supports the position of the second group of doctors as it suggests that in some cases bilirubin can enter the brain due to weak natural defenses caused by some diseases.
C: This choice does not support either position.
D: This choice provides a different benefit of bilirubin, but does not support either position.
E: This choice is not relevant to the position of the second group of doctors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: A group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering. 
A: The fact that the treatment to reduce bilirubin has no known negative side effects does not support the argument of the second group of doctors that bilirubin levels need not be reduced.
B: This choice supports the position of the second group of doctors as it claims that certain diseases can increase the likelihood of bilirubin entering the brain of newborns.
C: This choice does not provide any help to support the position of either of the groups of doctors.
D: This choice provides another benefit of bilirubin, but it does not relate to the position of the second group of doctors.
E: This choice is irrelevant to the argument of both groups of doctors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The first group of doctors treat newborn babies to reduce high levels of bilirubin.
  The second group of doctors argue that high levels of bilirubin in newborn babies should be allowed to remain, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Option E does not provide any information regarding whichever group of doctors is right, and options A, C, and D, are not relevant to the case presented in the context.
Option B is relevant in the sense that it supports the second group of doctors by suggesting that some diseases can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, which implies that newborns shouldn't be treated to reduce their bilirubin levels if their brain's natural defenses have been weakened. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The study observed two groups, Group A (composed of persons 65-75 years old) and Group B (composed of college students).
  Group A was better at remembering to make the telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  There were 14 lapses in Group B and only one lapse in Group A.
  At least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: The number of people in each group being equal does not necessarily impact the results of the study. It is unrelated to the conclusion drawn from the study that one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The study has two groups of people, Group A (65-75 years old) and Group B (college students). 
  Both groups were required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time, and the time was recorded. 
  Group A had significantly fewer lapses than Group B.
  
A: This fact is helpful to establish that the study was conducted in a fair manner. It is useful to rule out possible effects of group size. 
B: This fact is helpful to establish that the study was conducted in a fair manner. It indicates there was no group bias or difference in experimental design that could have affected the memory recall of both groups.
C: This fact may be helpful to establish that the lapse rate found in Group B may be even higher if participants over 40 were included. This strengthens the conclusion that memory recall does not suffer as a person ages. However, it does not challenge the conclusion that the memory recall for the elderly in Group A was better than for college students in Group B.
D: This fact is helpful to establish that everyone was provided equal opportunities to make the call and memory recall could not have been undermined by inadequate access to telephones or external factors. 
E: This fact is helpful to establish that memory recall comparisons between the two groups can be made without bias due to differences in instructions provided to the participants.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The passage describes a study in which two groups of people, Group A and Group B, were required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. Group A consisted of people between the ages of sixty-five to seventy-five years old, while Group B consisted of college students. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
A: This information seems helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
B: This information seems helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
C: This information seems somewhat irrelevant to establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
D: This information seems helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
E: This information seems helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The study found that Group A, composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old, were far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B, composed of college students. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A.
A: This option helps to ensure that the number of people in each group did not sway the outcome of the study. It is helpful.
B: This option helps to ensure that the same method for answering the calls was used for both Group A and Group B. It is helpful.
C: This option doesn't provide helpful information in establishing the conclusion. It is possible that age difference wasn't the only variable that differentiated the two groups. However, this information does not contradict or disprove the conclusion.
D: This option helps to ensure that both groups had the same opportunities to make their phone calls. It is helpful.
E: This option helps to ensure that the members of both groups had the same amount of time to prepare. It is helpful.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument suggests that Group A's age (65-75) is the reason why they were better at remembering to make a telephone call at a specified time compared to Group B (college students). 

A: This seems helpful in establishing the conclusion because it ensures that the sample size for both groups was equal. 
B: This fact doesn't help or hurt the conclusion as it only talks about the experimentors receiving the calls.
C: This statement is helpful to the argument, as it puts more emphasis on the idea that Group A's age is the cause of their better memory.
D: This doesn't help or hurt the argument because both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
E: This reinforces the idea that the groups received the same instructions, which has no effect on the age memory argument. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument claims that Group A performed better than Group B on a specific task, which is making a telephone call at a specified time. Therefore, any option that undermines the validity of this task as an indicator of memory efficiency would weaken the argument that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.

A: The fact that both groups had the same number of people could suggest that the groups were evenly balanced. This option does not provide any information that could affect the validity of the argument. 
B: The same group of researchers answering the calls made by both groups does not affect the validity of the conclusion that age may not affect the ability to complete this specific task.
C: The information about there being no persons older than forty in the study group of college students is irrelevant to the argument and does not affect the conclusion.
D: The information that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones is consistent with the test regarding the targeted task. Therefore, it is helpful to the conclusion.
E: If the members of the two groups received their instructions at significantly different times, this could throw doubt on the conclusion, since a difference in preparation could explain the different performance.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The study compares the performance of two groups, one composed of older individuals and one composed of college students, with respect to their ability to make a telephone call at a specified time. Group A (65 to 75-year-olds) performed better than Group B (college students).
  A: This option indicates that there is no discrepancy in the sample size between the groups, which is not helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  B: This option is important to establish that the conditions for the groups were the same, in that they both answered to the same group of researchers.
  C: This option is irrelevant to the study since a person's age of no more 40 years is neither included in the age group of the study nor in the college student group.
  D: This option is important to establish that both groups had the same resources, and all other conditions being equal, age was the significant factor.
  E: This option shows that the length of time provided for instruction was approximately the same, which is important in establishing a level playing field, which makes the study results more reliable.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The study compared the memory ability of two groups of people: Group A (65 to 75 years old) and Group B (college students).
  Group A had only one lapse and Group B had fourteen lapses in making a telephone call at a specified time, indicating that Group A is better at remembering to make a call on time.
  A: This statement is helpful as it ensures that the two groups were equal in size, which can be a factor in drawing proper conclusions.
  B: This statement is helpful as it ensures that the same group of researchers dealt with both groups, which can rule out the chances of different interpretation criteria between the two groups.
  C: This statement is least helpful as it does not offer any information about the memory abilities of the people in either of the groups.
  D: This statement is helpful as it ensures that both groups had equal opportunities to make the phone call, which rules out environmental factors as influences in drawing proper conclusions.
  E: This statement is helpful as it ensures that both groups received their instructions at approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which reduces the chances of differential motivation between the groups.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The study compares the performance of two distinct groups (Group A and Group B) in making a telephone call at a specified time. Group A is composed of 65-75 year olds and Group B is composed of college students. Group B had more lapses than Group A, indicating that the aging process does not necessarily affect all types of memory.
A: The fact that there were the same number of people in each group is expected in a well-controlled study, but it does not affect the validity of the conclusion.
B: The fact that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups is expected and does not affect the conclusion.
C: The fact that there were no persons more than forty years old among the college students could either support or detract from the conclusion, but it is still somewhat relevant and not the least helpful.
D: The fact that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls is also expected in a well-controlled study, but it does not affect the conclusion.
E: The fact that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls is relevant and supports the conclusion that aging does not necessarily affect all types of memory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The study found that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) performed better than Group B (composed of college students) in making a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time.
  A: This option seems relevant, as it confirms that the number of people in each group is not a factor that would affect the conclusion.
  B: This option seems relevant, as it confirms that the same group of researchers was involved in both groups and eliminates the possibility of researcher bias.
  C: This option does not seem relevant to the study's conclusion, as it only provides information about the age of the college students and does not contribute to the comparison of the two groups or their respective performance.
  D: This option seems relevant, as it confirms that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which eliminates potential confounding factors such as availability or access to phones.
  E: This option seems relevant, as it confirms that both groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which eliminates potential confounding factors such as the time gap between receiving instructions and making the call.

  C: This choice is beyond the scope of the passage and does not affect the commentator's argument.
  D: This answer is not relevant to the commentator's argument.
  E: This is the most likely answer because it could be possible that cynicism among journalists has always had a negative effect on society, thus affecting the commentator's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The commentator's argument claims that social critics' claim is absurd because journalists have always been cynics and therefore their cynicism could not have contributed to the undermining of our society's well-being. 
  A: The commentator's argument does not address the possibility that widespread cynicism is beneficial to the well-being of society, so it is not a criticism of the commentator's argument.
  B: The commentator's argument does not address the possibility that cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the amount of information one has about them, so it is not a criticism of the commentator's argument.
  C: The commentator's argument acknowledges that journalists have always been cynics and that contemporary journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors, so it is not a criticism of the commentator's argument.
  D: The commentator's argument does not address the accuracy of human behavior portrayed as selfish, so it is not a criticism of the commentator's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The commentator argues that the claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity is absurd, as journalists have always been cynics and are more restrained than their predecessors. 

A: This cannot be the answer since the commentator is arguing that cynicism is beneficial to the well-being of society. 
B: This is a close answer but it doesn't contradict the commentator's reasoning. 
C: This answer is out of scope as it talks about the genuineness of the cynicism. 
D: This answer contradicts the commentator's reasoning. The commentator argues that the claim that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity is absurd.  
E: This is the possible answer since commentators didn't talk about the negative consequences of cynicism on society. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The commentator argues that the claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency undermines the well-being of our society is absurd, since journalists have always been cynics and today's journalists are more restrained.
  A: This contradicts the commentator's position. The argument is not that widespread cynicism is beneficial, but that journalistic cynicism does not undermine our society's well-being.
  B: This statement does not address the commentator's argument that journalistic cynicism does not undermine our society's well-being.
  C: This does not necessarily undermine the commentator's position, which is that journalistic cynicism does not undermine our society's well-being.
  D: This also does not address the commentator's argument that journalistic cynicism does not undermine our society's well-being.
  E: This contradicts the commentator's argument that journalistic cynicism does not undermine our society's well-being, since he is arguing that journalistic cynicism is not a new phenomenon and is not having negative effects.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  In the argument, the commentator asserts that the claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines society's well-being is absurd. The commentator supports this claim by arguing that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to undermining society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics, and today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
  
A: The argument does not consider the possibility that widespread cynicism is beneficial to the well-being of society. Therefore, this is not a valid criticism of the argument.
B: The argument does not address whether cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the amount of information one has about them. Therefore, this is not a valid criticism of the argument.
C: The argument claims that journalists are cynics, so it is not overlooking the possibility that the work of contemporary journalists reflects a cynicism that is not really genuine. Therefore, this is not a valid criticism of the argument.
D: The argument does not address whether any accurate description of human behavior portrays it as selfish. Therefore, this is not a valid criticism of the argument.
E: The argument defends the notion that contemporary journalists' cynicism is not a contributing factor to the undermining of society's well-being. Therefore, this is not a valid criticism of the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The commentator is arguing that the claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency undermines society's well-being is absurd because journalists have always been cynics and are even more restrained today than their predecessors. The argument suggests that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of society's well-being.
Choices:
  A: The argument does not consider whether widespread cynicism is beneficial to society. In fact, it suggests that the claim that contemporary journalists' cynicism undermines society's well-being is absurd.
  B: This is a possible criticism of the argument. The argument assumes that the cynicism of contemporary journalists is constant over time, but this may not be the case. It may be the case that as people gain more information about powerful people, they become more cynical about their motives.
  C: This choice is not a relevant criticism of the argument. The argument assumes that the cynicism of contemporary journalists is genuine.

  C: This statement suggests that the cynicism of contemporary journalists may not be as harmful as the commentator's claim, but it does not address the commentator's argument.
  
  D: This statement presents a different claim about human behavior and is not relevant to the commentator's argument.
  
  E: This statement contradicts the commentator's argument that cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always been present and has not had a negative effect on the well-being of society.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The commentator claims that the cynicism of contemporary journalists is not a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, since journalists have always been cynics and are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
  
A: The commentator does not make a case for widespread cynicism being either beneficial or detrimental to the well-being of society. The argument is about whether or not the cynicism of contemporary journalists has a negative impact on society.
B: This choice is somewhat related to the argument, but it does not provide an alternative perspective to refute the commentator's reasoning.
C: This choice is not really related to the argument. The commentator assumes that the cynicism of contemporary journalists is genuine and argues that it is not a factor that undermines society's well-being.
D: This choice presents an alternative reasoning that could be used to argue against the conclusion of the commentator's argument, however, the commentator's main claim is that the cynicism of contemporary journalists is not a factor that undermines society's well-being.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The commentator argues that modern journalists' cynicism cannot be a factor in the undermining of society's well-being, because journalists have always been cynical and are more restrained today. 
  A: The possibility that widespread cynicism is beneficial to the well-being of society is unrelated to the argument at hand and is not discussed in the stimulus.
  B: The possibility that cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the amount of information one has about them is also unrelated, as the commentator's argument focuses on the difference between modern and past journalists, rather than ordinary people's cynicism.
  C: The possibility that the work of contemporary journalists reflects a cynicism that is not really genuine is a possibility. However, this does not address the commentator's claim that today's journalists are more restrained than their predecessors.
  D: The possibility that any accurate description of human behavior portrays it as selfish is also not relevant to the argument, as the commentator's claim is specific to the cynicism of journalists.
  E: The possibility that cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society is the most likely criticism of the commentator's argument, as the argument assumes that journalists' cynicism has not had a negative effect on society in the past or present.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Resident: Data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in our town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Question: The reasoning in the resident's argument is flawed in that the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the town has a relatively small number of houses
  B: inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe
  C: structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage
  D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe
  E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument presented by the resident is flawed because they are assuming that all houses with inadequate site drainage have structural defects that could possibly make them unsafe, and vice versa. Also, the argument is assuming that the percentages of houses with these problems are mutually exclusive. 
A: The number of houses in the town is not relevant to the argument.
B: This statement is true, but it does not address the flaws in the resident's argument.
C: This may be true, but it does not address the flaws in the resident's argument.
D: This is a possibility and would point out a flaw in the argument. If the percentage of houses with neither of these problems is high, then the overall percentage of problematic houses would be lower than 60%.
E: This is possible, but it would not change the argument much, as the resident is assuming that all problematic houses have both structural defects and inadequate site drainage. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The resident's argument is that the percentage of the houses with inadequate site drainage and the percentage of the houses with structural defects that could make them unsafe total to at least 60%.
  A: The size of the town, whether small or large, is not relevant to the argument's flaw.
  B: This statement is true and supports the resident's argument.
  C: Whether structural defects are easier to fix than inadequate site drainage is not relevant to the argument's flaw.
  D: This statement may be true, but it does not address the argument's flaw.
  E: This statement is already accounted for in the argument, as the percentages of houses with each issue were added together to make the 60% estimate.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The resident's argument claims that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and another 30% have structural defects. These two groups are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible that some houses have both kinds of problems.
  
  A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument.
  
  B: This statement is already mentioned in the resident's argument and is not overlooked.
  
  C: The argument is not concerned with comparative ease of fixing the different problems.
  
  D: This possibility is considered but does not provide an alternative explanation for why at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem.
  
  E: This possibility is not overlooked and is consistent with the argument.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The resident's argument concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity because 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects.
A: The argument does not address the number of houses in the town, but rather the percentage of houses with some kind of problem.
B: Inadequate site drainage is mentioned in the argument and is a factor that contributes to the conclusion.
C: The argument does not make any comparisons between the ease of fixing inadequate site drainage versus structural defects, nor does it address the fixability of the problems.
D: The argument assumes that all houses fall into one of the two mentioned categories, hence overlooking this possibility.
E: The argument does not specify whether the set of houses with structural defects overlaps with the set of houses with inadequate site drainage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The resident presented an argument that claims that at least 60% of the town's houses have a problem that threatens their integrity, based on data that show 30% of the town's houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
B: This information supports the argument's reasoning, rather than offering an alternative possibility.
C: This information is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
D: This option presents an alternative possibility that the argument overlooks. If many houses have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe, then the argument's conclusion that at least 60% of the town's houses have a problem that threatens their integrity could be incorrect.
E: The argument does not address this possibility, but it does not directly affect the reasoning presented in the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The resident's argument is that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity, because 30 percent of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  A: The number of houses in the town is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement supports the resident's argument that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument and is comparing the ease of fixing two different kinds of problems.
  D: This statement weakens the resident's argument, but does not directly address the possibility that some houses have multiple problems.
  E: This statement also supports the resident's argument that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument concludes that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity based on the evidence that 30 percent have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects.
A: The number of houses in the town is not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument acknowledges that inadequate site drainage can be a problem. This is not a possibility overlooked by the argument.
C: Whether structural defects are easier to fix than inadequate site drainage is not relevant to the argument.
D: This is a possibility that the argument overlooks. It is possible that some of the houses have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects.
E: This is not relevant to the argument. The argument only depends on the fact that both these problems exist in some houses.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The resident assumes that inadequate site drainage and structural defects are mutually exclusive, meaning that a house can only have one type of problem or the other. If a house has both problems, it would be counted twice and this could mean that the actual percentage of houses with problems is lower than what the resident claims.
A: The size of the town is not relevant to the reasoning of the resident's argument.
B: The argument acknowledges that inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe. 
C: The ease of fixing one type of problem versus the other is not relevant to the reasoning of the resident's argument.
D: This option presents an alternative possibility to the reasoning of the resident's argument, but it goes against the evidence presented in the argument.
E: This option is consistent with the evidence and assumptions provided in the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The resident argues that 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity based on the given data.
  A: The size of the town is irrelevant to the conclusion since it already is based on a percentage of the houses in the town.
  B: This choice is presented in the argument.
  C: This may be true, but it doesn't disprove the conclusion regarding the percentage of houses with problems.
  D: This choice is a possibility, but it doesn't disprove the conclusion regarding the percentage of houses with problems.
  E: This possibility is not significant since it would only reduce the conclusion slightly.

  The resident claims that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity, based on the data indicating that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  A: This answer may affect the total number of houses in the town but does not address the reasoning of the argument.
  B: This reinforces the argument's reasoning.
  C: This is irrelevant and does not address the argument's reasoning.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  A: This choice states that the most common species thrives in a forest because it is best suited to the local climate. However, it doesn't necessarily explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  B: This choice states that older trees tend to reproduce the least, but it doesn't necessarily explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  C: This choice is about the methodology used in the study but doesn't provide an explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  D: This choice focuses on the benefits of the survival of rarer species for the ecosystems as a whole. It doesn't necessarily explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  E: This choice suggests that the lower competition for resources allows the trees of the rarest species to survive longer, which can explain the observed pattern.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The study observes that trees of the species that is rarest in a particular forest tend to survive longer than the most common species, regardless of which species is the most common and rarest. 
Choices:
  A: This statement does not provide any explanation as to why the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  B: This statement provides a possible explanation as to why the rarest species tend to survive longer. If older trees of the most common species are reproducing less while trees of the rarest species are living longer, this would result in fewer members of the rare species being born while the rare species grows in number. 
  C: This statement doesn't impact the observation made in the study and doesn't provide an explanation as to why the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  D: This statement provides a possible explanation as to why it may be beneficial for tropical forests to have trees of the rarest species survive longer. It doesn't provide an explanation of why the rarest species are more likely to survive. 
  E: This statement provides a possible explanation as to why the rarest species tend to survive longer. Trees of the common species have more competition which may limit their resources while the trees of the rare species have fewer competitors and aren't receiving the same resource competition. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The question stem is asking for an explanation as to why the rarest species tends to survive longer in the studied tropical forests.
  A: This answer choice provides a reason for why the most common species is more abundant in the environment. However, it doesn't provide an explanation for why rare species tend to survive longer.
  B: This answer choice suggests that older trees reproduce less. It may be a related factor affecting the trees in the tropical forest, but it doesn't best help to explain why the rarest species tend to survive longer in the studied tropical forests.
  C: This answer choice states a fact about the study design. It doesn't address why the rarest species tend to survive longer in the studied tropical forests.
  D: This answer choice suggests that the survival of the trees of the rarer species is beneficial for the health of the tropical forests. It doesn't directly explain why rare species tend to survive longer in the studied tropical forests.
  E: This answer choice provides a reason for why the trees of the rare species tend to survive longer than the common species, which suggests that trees of the rare species have less competition for resources.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that while the species that is most common in a forest reproduces the most, trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Choices:
  A: This option explains why the most common species is best suited for the local climate, but it does not relate to the survival rates of the species.
  B: This option suggests that older trees of the species that reproduce the most tend to survive longer, which would contradict the findings of the study.
  C: This option suggests that the trees of rare species already existed in the tropical forests. While this is relevant information, it does not directly help explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  D: This option relates to the role of the rarer species' survival in tropical forests but it does not explain why the trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  E: This option directly suggests that the trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need, which may help to explain why the trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The study found that the rarest species of trees in a particular tropical forest tend to survive longer than the most common species regardless of which species are they and that the species of trees that reproduce the most in the forest are not necessarily those that survive the longest. 
A: This option explains why the most common species thrives in the forest, but it doesn't explain why the rarest species tend to survive longer.
B: This option provides information about the relation between age and reproduction rate, but it doesn't provide any insight into the question being asked.
C: This option provides information on how the study was conducted, but it doesn't provide any insight into the question being asked.
D: This option provides a reason why the survival of the trees of the rarer species is beneficial for tropical forests, but it doesn't explain why the trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
E: This option explains the possible reason why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species because trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do trees of the rare species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that in tropical forests, trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest. 
  Choice A is about why the most common species thrives.
  Choice B is about reproductive habits of older trees but does not explain why rare trees tend to live longer.
  Choice C is about the methodology of the study but does not explain why rare trees tend to live longer.
  Choice D is about the benefits to the ecosystem of rare trees surviving longer, but it does not explain why rare trees tend to live longer.
  Choice E is about the competition factor between trees, which may explain why rare trees live longer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The study shows that trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species in a particular forest regardless of which species is the most common or the rarest.
  
A: This choice provides an explanation for why the species of tree that is most common in a forest thrives there. It does not explain why trees of the rare species would survive longer.
  
B: This answer provides a possible explanation for why the older trees of the most common species might reproduce less, but it does not explain why the trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  
C: This choice indicates how the study was conducted but does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
  
D: This choice suggests that the survival of the trees of the rarer species might be beneficial because it helps tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction, but it does not explain why the trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species. 
  
E: If trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do trees of the rare species, this might explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species. This appears to be the best answer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that trees of rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species in tropical forests, regardless of the identities of the species concerned. 
  A: The common species is thriving because it is best suited to the climate. However, this statement does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  B: This statement provides some additional information about tree reproduction but is irrelevant to the observation that trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  C: This statement reiterates how the study was conducted but does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  D: This statement may seem plausible, but it is not supported by the information given in the context. 
  E: This statement provides a potential explanation for the observation that trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer. If the trees of the common species have more competition for resources, this extra competition could make it more likely that they will die younger than trees of the rare species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that in a tropical forest the species of trees that is rarest tend to survive longer, regardless of which species is the most common.
  A: This statement describes a reason why the most common species thrives in a forest but does not offer an explanation as to why the rarer species survive longer.
  B: This statement describes the reproduction rate of older trees, but does not offer an explanation as to why the rarer species survive longer.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The argument concludes that we should reject Tolstoy's claim because knowing more about the events leading to an action does not necessarily make us cease to praise or blame a person for that action.

A: This answer choice suggests that people should not be held accountable for actions they did not have control over. However, this is unrelated to the argument's conclusion about whether knowing more about the events changes how we praise or blame a person.
B: This answer choice states that the responsibility for an action does not depend on the amount of information others possess about that action. This aligns with the argument's conclusion that it is incorrect to assume that knowing more information would necessarily make us stop praising or blaming a person for their action.
C: This answer choice is almost saying the same thing as the premise of the argument, that we must only praise or blame people for actions that they freely performed. However, it is not properly connecting the premise to the conclusion.
D: This answer mentions "blame and praise" and suggests that our inclination to blame or praise changes depending on the information available to us. This aligns with what the argument is concluding, so it is the correct answer.
E: This answer says the opposite of what the premise suggests, and does not help us determine what the conclusion should be.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The ethicist argues that we can praise or blame a person for an action only when we have a lot of information surrounding the event that led to that action.
  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that we would not regard an action as freely performed if we knew more about the events leading up to it.
  
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
B: This statement affirms the argument of the ethicist. It states that others' knowledge about an act is not what determines whether the person doing it is genuinely responsible.
C: This statement is a repetition of the argument the ethicist is making, but it does not provide any additional assumptions to support that conclusion. It is not an assumption, but rather the conclusion of the argument.
D: This statement is true, but it does not provide any additional assumptions to support the conclusion of the argument.
E: This statement contradicts the argument of the ethicist who states that we can praise or blame an action only when we have a lot of information surrounding the event that led to that action.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument is about justifying the praise or blame of a person for an action only when we know a lot about the events that led to it. The argument refutes Tolstoy's claim that we would stop regarding an action as freely performed if we know a lot about the events leading up to it.
A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame only if their actions were caused by conditions beyond their control. This statement is not directly connected to the conclusion of the argument. 
B: This statement directly supports the conclusion of the argument, which claims that our justification for praising or blaming a person should not be based on the information others possess about the act. 
C: This statement is already assumed in the argument so it does not directly support the conclusion.
D: This statement is partially supporting the conclusion, but it introduces the concept of inclination to blame or praise whereas the argument does not discuss inclination. 
E: The argument does not discuss the level of knowledge as being a decisive factor in the concept of freely performed actions, so this statement is irrelevant to the conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The ethicist argues that only when we know a lot about the events leading up to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action. The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
A: This choice contradicts the ethicist's premise that we are sometimes justified in praising or blaming a person for an action. 
B: This choice agrees with the ethicist's premise that how much information people possess about an act does not determine whether the person doing it is genuinely responsible. However, it does not enable us to conclude the argument being made. 
C: This choice states the ethicist's premise, but it does not enable us to conclude the argument being made. 
D: This choice supports the ethicist's premise and enables us to conclude the argument being made. If the responsibility a person has for an action is not a matter of degree, then the conclusion that we must be careful about praising or blaming a person based on the information we have is valid. If our inclination to praise or blame someone does vary with the information we have, then being careful about such praise or blame is important. 
E: This choice is the opposite of the premise presented by the ethicist that states we need to know a lot about the events leading up to an action to praise or blame someone for it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for their actions if we know a lot about the events leading up to it. 
  A: This answer may be related to the topic but it is outside of the argument made by the ethicist. It supports the idea that there are events beyond a person's control that can influence their actions, but it does not enable the conclusion.
  B: This answer matches the conclusion of the argument made by the ethicist. It supports that others' knowledge about an action does not determine the person's genuine responsibility for it.
  C: This answer restates the premise of the argument, which is that we can only praise or blame if the action was freely performed. It does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  D: This answer shifts the focus of the argument to our inclination to praise or blame, which is not the main point of the argument. It does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  E: This answer is opposite to the premise of the argument, which suggests that we need to know a lot about the events that led to an action to praise or blame a person for it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The ethicist argues that praising or blaming a person for an action is justified only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  A: This answer choice is not aligned with the ethicist's argument and does not support the conclusion.
  B: This answer choice correctly summarizes the ethicist's argument that others' knowledge of an act does not determine the person's responsibility for that act.
  C: This answer choice is restating the same point made by the ethicist, but it is not directly aligned with the argument about knowing a lot about the events that led to the action.
  D: This answer choice introduces a different concept of degrees of responsibility that is not aligned with the ethicist's argument about the amount of information needed to justify blame or praise for an action.
  E: This answer choice is the opposite of the argument made by the ethicist.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for their action if we know a lot about the events that led to it. This is in contrast to Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.

A: This is an extreme answer that goes beyond the scope of the argument made by the ethicist.
B: If we did not have enough information about an act, we would not know whether the person doing it is or is not responsible for that action. Nevertheless, this answer does not enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
C: This answer essentially restates the argument made by the ethicist.
D: This answer suggests that our inclination to praise or blame someone is influenced by our knowledge of the events leading up to an action. This is consistent with the argument made by the ethicist.
E: This answer is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist, as it deals with our perception of an action rather than our ability to praise or blame someone.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we are justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  A: This answer choice is too extreme as it argues that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: This answer choice supports the ethicist's argument in that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: This answer choice is incorrect as it merely restates a premise of the ethicist's argument.
  D: This answer choice is incorrect as it states that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, which does not support the ethicist's argument.
  E: This statement contradicts the ethicist's argument, which is that we must know a lot about the events that led to an action to be justified in praising or blaming a person for that action.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
The ethicist is arguing against Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. The ethicist argues that knowing more about events leading up to an action can, in fact, justify praising or blaming someone for that action, even though the details of the events might ultimately serve to explain why the action was performed. The question asks for an implicit assumption that would enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
  
  A: This answer is not relevant to the argument that the ethicist is making.
  B: This answer is consistent with the argument but does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  C: This answer is nearly identical to the ethicist's argument. If we can only be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action that we regard as freely performed, then it follows that we cannot be justified in doing so if an action is not freely performed. 
  D: This answer does not support the conclusion that the ethicist makes. The argument is that knowledge of events leading up to an action can inform the extent to which we praise or blame someone for that action.
  E: This answer is not directly relevant to the argument the ethicist is making.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
The conclusion of the argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events leading to an action would cause us to cease to regard that action as freely performed. Therefore, the correct answer should support the conclusion of the argument.
Knowledge: 
  Option A is a claim that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  Option B says that whether or not a person is genuinely responsible for their action is not determined by how much information others possess about the action.
  Option C says that we can only be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action if we believe it was freely performed.
  Option D says that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to praise or blame them varies depending on the amount of information available.
  Option E says that If we do not know much about the events leading up to an action, we will view the action as freely performed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The argument by the economists is that trading goods or services produced in urban areas for agricultural products that were previously produced domestically will address problems caused by urbanization. 
A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers is a separate issue; it doesn't address the argument presented by the economist. 
B: This statement is too broad and does not relate directly to the argument presented by the economists. 
C: This option supports the argument presented by the economists, that a trade-based solution would be effective. 
D: This statement takes a different perspective altogether and does not directly support the argument of the economists. 
E: This statement suggests the opposite of what the economists are saying, and so it is not supportive evidence. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two different approaches to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  One approach involves reducing migration from rural areas.
  The other approach involves trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
  The correct answer should provide support for the economists' assertion.

A: This answer choice talks about how government subsidies can help the migration problems between rural and urban areas, but it does not provide support for the economist's assertion on trading goods. So this answer choice can be eliminated.
B: This answer choice suggests that all economic problems have economic solutions but it does not provide any support for the economist's assertion on trading goods.
C: This answer choice supports the economist's assertion on trading goods by stating that scarcity of agricultural products is a central element to the problems caused by urbanization. Hence, this answer choice can be selected.
D: This answer choice suggests that trade imbalances between countries are the primary cause of problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas, which does not support the economist's assertion on trading goods. Hence, this answer choice can be eliminated.
E: This answer choice talks about how free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization, but it does not provide support for the economist's assertion on trading goods. Hence,this answer choice can be eliminated.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The economists suggest that planners could solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by trading with agricultural communities. 
  A: This statement does not directly support the economists' assertion as it does not mention trading with agricultural communities.
  B: This statement is a general assertion but does not directly support the economists' assertion.
  C: This statement supports the economists' assertion as it highlights the importance of agricultural products.
  D: This statement is not relevant as it suggests that problems associated with migration are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries, which is not the concern of the given context.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the given context as it discusses free trade policies and their effects on increasing urbanization.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by urban population for the agricultural products previously produced domestically can effectively solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  A: The government's subsidies to urban manufacturers may or may not be related to the assertion made by the economists.
  B: This statement is too broad and cannot be used as evidence.
  C: If a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization, then it would support the economists' assertion that trading goods or services produced by predominantly urban populations for agricultural products would solve these problems.
  D: Trade imbalances between countries do not address the issue of migration from rural to urban areas, and thus do not provide support for the economists' assertion.
  E: This statement implies that free trade policies may be a cause of problems associated with increasing urbanization, but it is not a direct support for the economists' assertion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
   The context explains that economists believe that trading urban goods and services to obtain agricultural products instead of reducing migration from rural areas can effectively address problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  
  A: This option suggests that government intervention can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas. It does not provide direct support for the economists' assertion that trading urban goods and services is an effective solution.
  
  B: This option presents a general statement but does not relate to the specific situation at hand.
  
  C: This option aligns with the economists' assertion by stating that agricultural product scarcity is central to the problems created by urbanization.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist's argument is that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are evidently correct because a large study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia's symptoms. 
  A: Inferring from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect is not relevant to the argument at hand.
  B: The argument did not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased.
  C: The argument did not use two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
  D: The argument did not confuse an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  E: The argument did not rely on a sample that is unrepresentative.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument posits that melatonin alleviates insomnia's symptoms.
  The argument reasons that the claims of melatonin supplements' manufacturers about aging are correct based on the study results.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals.
  C: The argument does not use different meanings for the same term.
  D: This choice is relevant to the argument because the argument concludes that melatonin supplements alleviate insomnia's symptoms because the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages. The argument confuses the effect of a phenomenon (less melatonin production) with its cause (aging).
  E: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist argues that melatonin alleviates symptoms of insomnia.
  The pharmacist concludes that melatonin supplement's claims that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  A: Inferring causation from correlation occurs when an argument states or implies that one thing causes another, but in reality, the two things are only correlated, and it cannot be shown that one causes the other.
  B: An argument that relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased might not be reliable.
  C: An argument that depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion is making a fallacy of equivocation.
  D: Confusing an effect of a phenomenon with its cause occurs when an argument mistakes the effect of a phenomenon as the cause of the phenomenon.
  E: An unrepresentative sample cannot be generalized, and it might affect the credibility of the argument's conclusion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The study involved people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia.
- Most insomnia symptoms are alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
- Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland and regulates the body's biological clock.
- The manufacturers of melatonin supplements claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.

Analysis:
- The pharmacist concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct based on the large study's results.
- However, the study only shows that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia's symptoms. It does not directly support the claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
- The pharmacist's argument makes a cause-and-effect conclusion that is not directly supported by evidence.

Action: Answer("D")

  The argument claims that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, and that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.

A: This choice describes the fallacy of "post hoc, ergo propter hoc." However, the conclusion of the argument is not necessarily wrong simply because of this fallacy.
B: This choice suggests that the argument relies on biased individuals, but no reference is made to any such individuals in the argument.
C: This choice is not relevant to the argument since no term is used in two different meanings.
D: This choice describes the fallacy of confusing a cause with an effect. However, the argument does not make this mistake.
E: This choice is relevant since the argument relies on a study of a specific group (people aged 65-81) and it may not be generalizable to the larger population.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that most of insomnia's symptoms are alleviated by ingesting melatonin. 
  The argument concludes that manufacturers claims that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct. 
  
A: This is not relevant to the argument made by the pharmacist.
B: There is no evidence in the argument to support this choice.
C: There is no evidence in the argument to support this choice.
D: The argument concludes that the manufacturers claim is correct based on the effectiveness of melatonin. This is a reasonable inference to make.
E: There is no evidence in the argument to support this choice.

Action: Answer("C")  
The pharmacist's argument is flawed because it depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct, because a large study shows that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock.
  A: This choice is not related to the argument's flaw.
  B: This choice is not related to the argument's flaw.
  C: This choice is not related to the argument's flaw.
  D: The argument confuses the effect of a phenomenon with its cause by endorsing the reason given by the melatonin supplements manufacturers, that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages, as the cause of melatonin's effectiveness in treating insomnia, whereas, the study only demonstrates the effect of taking melatonin supplements on alleviating insomnia's symptoms in people aged 65-81. 
  E: The study is described as "a large study" without any indication to its representativeness. Therefore, we cannot assume that the sample is unrepresentative.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist's argument states that a study showed ingesting melatonin can alleviate most symptoms of insomnia. 
  The pharmacist argues that claims made by the manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  A: This choice is not relevant.
  B: This choice is not relevant.
  C: This choice is not relevant.
  D: The pharmacist's argument is flawed as it confuses the effect of aging on melatonin production with the cause of insomnia. 
  E: This choice is not relevant.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - The argument mentions a study of people aged 65-81 with insomnia that found melatonin alleviates symptoms.
  - The argument concludes that recent claims by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct, which assert that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The argument is flawed because it confuses the effect of a phenomenon (age-related reduction in melatonin produced by the pineal gland) with its cause (older adults suffering from insomnia). The study shows that melatonin helps alleviate insomnia symptoms in older adults, but it does not necessarily support the claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin. The argument overlooks the possibility that other factors may also contribute to the reduction of melatonin in older adults. Therefore, the best answer is D, which is the most accurate description of the flaw in the argument.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist argues that:
    - Most symptoms of insomnia are alleviated by melatonin.
    - Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland.
    - Melatonin supplements are claimed to help those experiencing reduced secretion of melatonin due to aging.
  A: The argument does not infer that the action was intended to produce the effect.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of biased individuals.
  C: The argument does not use two different meanings for the same term.
  D: The argument does not confuse the effect with the cause.
  E: The argument relies on a sample, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to determine whether it is representative.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that the results of an experiment with 50 patients with chronic back pain, in which small magnets were applied to the backs of one group and the other group received no treatment, show that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain. 
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the patients in the first group could have been due to something other than the application of the magnets.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the effectiveness of the magnets in relieving back pain.
  C: This statement suggests that the results of the experiment may not be applicable to other areas of pain or the rest of the body.
  D: This statement does not address the results of the experiment and is irrelevant.
  E: This statement suggests that the differences in the causes of the back pain could have affected the results. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that based on the experiment with 50 patients, magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  A: This choice presents a possible explanation for improvement in some patients in the first group, however, it does not contradict the argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  B: This choice does not address the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain. It only presents a different perspective on the effectiveness of medication compared to magnetic fields.
  C: This choice does not contradict the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain. It only limits the scope of the argument to the back.
  D: This choice does not contradict the physician's argument, as it does not provide any evidence against the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  E: This choice weakens the physician's argument because the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment may have affected the effectiveness of magnetic fields in treatment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment conducted with 50 patients with chronic back pain where small magnets were applied to the backs of one group and the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that some people may experience an improvement simply because they think they are receiving treatment, which does not necessarily contradict the assertion that magnets might help relieve back pain.
  B: Most physicians' opinions would not necessarily affect whether magnets actually relieve chronic back pain.
  C: Since the argument is about back pain, the area of pain relief in other areas is not relevant to the physician's claim.
  D: This statement does not demonstrate that the experiment was poorly designed or invalid in any way.
  E: This information might suggest that the sample was not homogeneous and that this may affect the reliability of the conclusions drawn from the data.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The physician believes that the application of magnets to the backs of patients with back pains is effective at relieving pain.
  A: The argument suggests that the actual application of magnets to the back reduces pain. Therefore, if it is true that a patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition, this argument doesn't necessarily reduce the strength of the physician's argument. 
  B: The argument is focused on the effectiveness of magnets and not on the effectiveness of medication. Therefore, this argument doesn't necessarily reduce the strength of the physician's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that the effectiveness of magnets to alleviate pain in other parts of the body is unknown. However, it doesn't necessarily reduce the strength of the physician's argument that magnets alleviate back pain.
  D: This statement may imply that there is a bias towards the results of the experiment. It however doesn't necessarily reduce the strength of the physician's argument.
  E: The statement suggests a potential problem with the validity of the experiment, as the back pains have various causes. This may reduce the strength of the physician's argument, given that the experiment has a potential design bias due to the variation in causes of the back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The physician's argument is that "magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain" based on the experiment where 50 patients were divided into two groups and most patients in the first group, which received small magnets applied to their backs, reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few patients in the second group, which received no treatment, reported such reduction.
- A: The knowledge that a treatment has been applied can lead to a placebo effect, which may affect the results of the experiment.
- B: The physician's argument is not an argument against the more effective use of medication, so this option is not a counterargument.
- C: If there are no other studies showing the same result as the physician's experiment, it could undermine the generalizability of the conclusions.
- D: If the scientists who designed the experiment were biased towards magnetic fields, the experiment might not have been designed and conducted in an objective way, so the results may be biased.
- E: If there was a wide variation in the causes of chronic back pain among the patients in the experiment, it could be a confounding factor that affects the reliability of the results.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The physician conducted an experiment with two groups in which patients were treated with magnets in one group and not treated in the other group. The physician argues that the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain while few patients reported relief from the pain in the second group. Therefore, the physician suggests that the magnets are probably effective at relieving chronic back pain.
A: This choice suggest that a patient's expectations can influence a report of improvement. However, it does not contradict the evidence of the experiment. 
B: This choice does not contradict the evidence of the experiment, because it does not provide any information about the effectiveness of magnets on reducing back pain.
C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because the physician only tested the effectiveness of magnets on relieving chronic back pain.
D: This choice reinforces the idea that magnetic fields work in reducing chronic back pain, but it does not contradict the evidence of the experiment.
E: This choice contradicts the physician's argument by pointing out that there were many causes of the chronic back pain, which makes it impossible to determine if magnets are really effective in reducing pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain, based on an experiment with 50 patients with chronic back pain, where small magnets were applied to the backs of one group, and the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, but very few in the second group did.
  A: This choice suggests that the patients in the first group improved not because of the magnetic fields, but simply because they knew they were receiving some kind of treatment.
  B: This choice is an alternative claim, but it does not counter the physician's argument directly.
  C: This choice is an alternative claim, but it does not counter the physician's argument directly.
  D: This choice does not directly counter the physician's argument.
  E: This is the strongest counter to the physician's argument as it suggests that there might be other factors besides the magnetic fields that might have caused the significant reduction in pain in some of the patients in the first group. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients who received the treatment reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the group that received no treatment reported the same.
  A: This statement concerns a plausible mechanism by which a treatment can improve a patient's condition. But it does not affect the physician's argument that the magnets' effectiveness was demonstrated by the results of the experiment. 
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the conclusion that can be drawn from the results of the experiment.
  C: This statement is also irrelevant to the conclusion drawn from the results of the experiment.
  D: This statement supplies a motive for some of those involved in the experiment to have produced results that supported the conclusion that magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain. But it does not affect the logical strength of the physician's argument for that conclusion.
  E: This statement constitutes the strongest counter to the physician's argument, as it shows an alternative explanation for why one group reported a significant reduction in pain while the other did not. If the patients in the magnet group had chronic back pain caused by something different than those in the untreated group, the relief of pain experienced by the magnet group might have been due to some factor that was peculiar to their back problems, rather than the magnetic fields. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The physician argues that the magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain, based on the results of an experiment conducted on 50 patients with chronic back pain. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group, and most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain. The other group received no treatment.
  
  A: This statement suggests that the patient's expectation can influence his or her perception of an improvement in the condition. But it does not present a logical counter to the physician's argument.
  
  B: This statement is a general belief of physicians, but it does not provide evidence against the physician's argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields in treating back pain.
  
  C: This statement suggests that the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing pain in areas other than the back has not been established through experiments. But this statement does not present direct evidence that the results of the experiment in question may be invalid. 
 
  D: This statement suggests that the design of the experiment may have been biased because some of the scientists involved had a pre-existing belief in the effectiveness of magnetic fields. However, this statement does not provide direct evidence that the results of the experiment in question may be invalid.
  
  E: This statement directly suggests that there may have been confounding variables or variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment, which could have influenced the results. This statement represents the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
 According to the context, the physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the group that received small magnets reported a significant reduction in pain. This implies that the physician's argument is based on the assumption of a causal relationship between the application of magnets and the reduction of pain. So, if any option presents a different logical explanation or alternative cause for the phenomenon observed in the experiment, it would constitute the strongest counter to the physician's argument.

  A: This option does not present any different explanation or alternative cause for the phenomenon observed in the experiment.
  B: Although this option presents a different treatment modality, it does not present any different explanation or alternative cause for the phenomenon observed in the experiment.
  C: This option only narrows the scope of the argument to back pain, but it does not present any different explanation or alternative cause for the phenomenon observed in the experiment.
  D: Although this option presents a potential conflict of interest, it does not present any different explanation or alternative cause for the phenomenon observed in the experiment.
  E: This option presents an alternative cause for the observed phenomenon by suggesting that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment may have affected the perceived reduction in pain; therefore, it constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result?
Choices:
  A: For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
  B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The hardware store sold roughly equal numbers of Maxlast and Styron brand hammers.
  Only the Maxlast hammers were on sale last week and were put in a display case near the store's entrance.
  The Styron hammers were sold at their usual price and location.
  Contrary to expectations, the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
A: The statement is not relevant to explaining why customers bought more Styron hammers even when Maxlast hammers were on sale.
B: This statement suggests that low prices might not be the primary factor attracting customers which, if true, does put the sales strategy in question. However, it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers under these circumstances.
C: This statement might indicate that the customers who bought Maxlast hammers were aware of it because of the sale last week, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
D: While the flyers may have contributed to attracting more customers to the store and led them to buy hammers, the statement does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
E: This statement suggests that a single item on sale does not motivate customers to make a special trip to a store, which is not relevant in explaining why Styron hammers in this store outsold Maxlast hammers while they were on sale.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The hardware store sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers.
  All the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
A: The fact that customers do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise right after entering the store would not be a strong reason for the surprising result. It does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast ones. So A is not the best answer.
B: The statement suggests that the customers are not very price-sensitive, which might explain why the Styron ones outsold Maxlast ones and it could be a potential answer to the question. 
C: Although the fact that customers were mentioning the sale last week as their reason to buy could help explain why Maxlast sales increased, it does not sufficiently explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast ones. So C is not the best answer. 
D: This option suggests that the store might have advertised the sale on Maxlast hammers, but it doesn't provide strong reasoning for why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast ones.
E: This option suggests that customers may not make a special trip to the store just because one item is on sale. However, it doesn't give any explanation as to why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast ones.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  A: This may explain why a shopper may miss a particular item after entering the store, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  B: This option hints that the customers were not primarily price-sensitive and yet it was surprising that Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  C: This implies that shoppers were most likely aware of the sale on Maxlast hammers and there was a reason for the sudden increase in sale of Maxlast hammers. But it does not explain why Styron hammers were still sold more than Maxlast hammers.
  D: If this option is true, then it is most likely that the shoppers who bought Maxlast hammers did so because of the flyers and not necessarily because of their preference for Maxlast hammers. But it still does not explain why Styron hammers would outsell Maxlast hammers despite the sale prices.
  E: This option refers to a single item on sale not motivating shoppers to make a special trip to a store and does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers despite the latter being on sale.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez, because Lopez eventually won the election. To undermine this argument, we need to find a choice that suggests that the survey results were not biased or were not influenced by the election outcome.
A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument. It talks about the voters' behavior rather than the survey results.
B: This choice might undermine the argument since it suggests that most of the people who watched the debate thought that Tanner was more reasonable. However, this choice uses the words 'immediate afterward', so it is not clear if the survey respondents were influenced by the election outcome.
C: This choice talks about different voting behaviors, so it is irrelevant.
D: This choice is irrelevant to the argument since it talks about what the viewers thought before the debate. 
E: This choice is also irrelevant because it talks about how close the election was rather than the survey results.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The survey respondents who thought Lopez had better arguments might have been biased in favor of Lopez because he won the election.
Choices:
  A: This statement is irrelevant to whether the survey respondents who thought that Lopez had better arguments were biased in their evaluations.
  B: If most of the live audience thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then that undermines the conclusion that the viewers surveyed were biased.
  C: This statement, if true, suggests that Tanner might have won if those who had not watched the debate had watched it.
  D: This statement provides some limited support for the argument that viewers surveyed might have been biased in favor of Lopez if they eventually voted for Tanner.
  E: A narrow margin of victory does not suggest that the survey respondents who thought that Lopez had better arguments were biased in their evaluations.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the viewers surveyed who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez, because Lopez eventually won the election. 
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument being made. 
  B: This statement undermines the argument by presenting information that contradicts the conclusion. If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterwards said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then we have reason to doubt the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument being made. 
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument being made.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument being made.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presented is that the survey that showed people thought Lopez had better arguments may have been biased in favor of him since he eventually won the election.
  A: This statement may be true, but it does not necessarily undermine the argument.
  B: If most in the audience thought that Tanner was more persuasive, it would contradict the survey results and undermine the argument.
  C: If the people who watched the debate were more likely to vote for Tanner, it might suggest that there was some selection bias in the survey, but it does not necessarily undermine the argument that the survey may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  D: The fact that before the debate most viewers said they would probably vote for Tanner does not necessarily undermine the survey results after the debate that favored Lopez.
  E: This statement does not necessarily undermine the argument that the survey of viewers' opinions of the debate may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez, because he eventually did win the election.
  
A: This answer choice is saying that most people who voted in the election did not watch the debate. It is not very relevant to the argument and does not undermine it.
B: This answer choice is saying that most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate. This suggests that the survey respondents might have been biased in favor of Lopez, because they may not be representative of the live audience watching the debate. This undermines the argument.
C: This answer choice is saying that the people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate. This is not necessarily relevant to the argument, because the argument is discussing survey respondents who reported that Lopez made better arguments during the debate, not the viewing habits of voters in general.
D: This answer choice says that most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner. This is not necessarily relevant to the argument, because the argument is discussing survey respondents who reported that Lopez made better arguments during the debate, not their voting preferences before the debate.
E: This answer choice is saying that Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin. While this is interesting, it doesn't really undermine the argument that the survey respondents might have been biased.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  - Lopez eventually did win the election.
A: This choice suggests that most of the people who voted for Lopez did not watch the debate, which means that the election results cannot be used as evidence supporting Lopez's superiority in the debate. It doesn't directly undermine the argument that the survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
B: This choice suggests that the viewers' opinions differed from the survey respondents' opinions, which undermines the argument that the debate viewers thought that Lopez made the better arguments.
C: This choice suggests that the debate viewers were not representative of the general population that voted, which might create doubt about how well the debate viewers' perceptions of the candidates' arguments correlated with the perceptions of the general population. However, it doesn't directly undermine the argument that the survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
D: This choice is irrelevant to the argument.
E: This choice isn't relevant since the argument doesn't concern the margin of victory in the election.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he won the election. 
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate. This suggests that the televised debate may have had little to do with the ultimate outcome of the election and does not undermine the argument that the survey respondents may have been biased.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. This undermines the argument because it suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better than Tanner's may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate. This statement appears irrelevant to the argument being made.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner. This statement also appears irrelevant to the argument being made.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin. This statement, although interesting, does not undermine the argument that the survey respondents may have been biased in favor of the eventual winner. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument is about potential bias in a survey of viewers' perceptions of the better debater. The fact that Lopez went on to win the election is another piece of information that may have influenced the perceptions of viewers surveyed right after the debate.
A: This undermines the argument somewhat, but it does not relate to the specific concern that respondents may have been biased in Lopez's favor.
B: This statement suggests that viewers' perceptions are not a reliable indicator of Lopez's skill as a debater, which would undermine the argument. 
C: This statement relates to voting behavior, but not to the specific concern that respondents may have been biased in Lopez's favor.
D: This statement is about pre-debate polling, not perceptions of the debate itself.
E: This statement strengthens the argument by indicating that the election was close.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez since he eventually won the election. Thus, any information that casts doubt on the idea that winning the election suggests having stronger arguments undermines the argument.

A: This statement does not address the issue of whether the winning candidate had stronger arguments, and it provides information about people who did not watch the debate. Hence, it is irrelevant.
B: If the survey respondents who thought that Lopez had better arguments were not representative of the live audience, then this would undermine the argument that the survey respondents were biased in favor of Lopez.
C: This statement provides information about the relationship between watching the debate and voting for Tanner, but it does not address whether the winning candidate had stronger arguments. Hence, it is irrelevant.
D: This statement provides information about the viewers' pre-debate preferences, but it does not address whether the winning candidate had stronger arguments. Hence, it is irrelevant.
E: This statement undermines the argument because it suggests that Lopez's eventual victory may not have been due to better arguments, but to other factors that led to a narrow margin of victory.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  A: The fact that most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate does not directly undermine the argument.
  B: The fact that most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than Lopez do undermine the argument. 
  C: The fact that people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than people who did not watch the debate does not directly undermine the argument.
  D: The fact that most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said they would probably vote for Tanner does not directly undermine the argument.
  E: The fact that Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin does not directly undermine the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks issued per pay period to estimate employment in Country X.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours worked, employee overtime, and bonuses
  There was a large increase in the estimated number of people employed in the first quarter the program was used.

Action: Answer("D")
The fact that some employers in X issued separate paychecks means that a single employee may be counted multiple times in the tally. This would cause the government to overestimate the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used, making choice D the correct answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The new program used by the Government of Country X simply counted the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and used that to estimate employment figures.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours worked, for overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The fact that some employers issue separate paychecks for different categories of pay means that the number of paychecks may not be the same as the number of employees. Some employees may receive multiple paychecks, which would overestimate the employment figures.
    
Action: Answer("D")  
    The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used, as the program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers which would not accurately estimate employment figures since some employees may receive multiple paychecks.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in the country.
  The new program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  The government reported that there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  
  A: There is no evidence in the passage that indicates that the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before, and we cannot conclude anything about the level of accuracy.
  B: The passage does not provide any information about the awareness of the people who designed the new program, whether they were aware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period or not, so we cannot conclude anything about their awareness.
  C: The passage does not provide any information about whether the government had reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used or not, so we cannot conclude anything about the government's reporting.
  D: The people who received separate paychecks for different forms of payment could have been counted as separate employees under the new program, leading to the overestimation of the total number of people employed in X in the first quarter. Therefore, based on the passage, we can conclude that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: The passage says that the government reported that there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used, so we cannot conclude that there was no growth in the number of people employed in X during that quarter.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program in 1988 to determine the number of people employed in that country.
  The program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses.
  
Analysis:
  If some employers in X issued separate paychecks for various types of pay, this would suggest that the number of paychecks issued would be greater than the actual number of people employed.
  Given that the government reported a large increase in employment, it is likely that the number of paychecks was overestimated. 
  Therefore, D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used is the correct answer.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
To estimate the number of people employed, the government of Country X uses a computer program that tallies the number of paychecks issued by employers. The program was implemented in 1988. 
For the first quarter in 1988, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours worked, overtime, and bonuses and commissions.
 
A: There is no information in the passage to suggest that the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before. 
B: The passage does not provide information about the awareness of those who designed the program about workers in X receiving more than one paycheck per pay period. 
C: There is no information in the passage to suggest whether or not the government had reported strong growth in the number of people employed in the quarters just before the new program was used. 
D: The passage states that some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours worked, overtime, and bonuses and commissions. If separate paychecks were issued for each of these different categories, the number of paychecks would likely exceed the actual number of workers employed, which would result in the government overestimating the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
E: There is no information in the passage to suggest that there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program simply counted the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers to estimate employment, which means it does not distinguish between regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions. 
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed compared to the immediately preceding quarter. 
  Some employers in Country X issued separate paychecks for regular hours worked, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
From the given information, we can conclude that the computer program counted all paychecks issued, regardless of the reasons for the issue. Therefore, it overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. Thus, the most appropriate answer is (D). 
Response 6:
Knowledge: The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in X. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions. The government reported that there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
 
A: There is no indication in the passage that the use of the new computer program led to less accuracy in the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed. 
B: There is no indication in the passage that the people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
C: There is no information in the passage about whether the government had reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used. 
D: Since the new computer program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and some employers issued separate paychecks for different types of payments, it is highly likely that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
E: There is no information in the passage that contradicts the government's claims of growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - In 1988, the government of Country X used a new computer program to determine the number of people employed.
  - The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  - The government reported a large increase in employment compared to the previous quarter.
  - In the first quarter of the new program, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
  A: The passage does not provide any information regarding the accuracy of the government's estimate of employment before or after the implementation of the new program.
  B: The passage does not provide any information regarding the knowledge of the designers of the new program about some workers in X receiving multiple paychecks per pay period.
  C: The passage does not provide any information regarding the government's reports on employment for the quarters just before the new program was implemented.
  D:Because some employers in X issued separate paychecks, the total number of paychecks was greater than the total number of employed people. Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: The fact that some employees receive separate paychecks does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that there was no growth in employment.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X counted the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in Country X, using that figure as its estimate of employment. 
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  
Analysis:
  The new computer program only counts the number of paychecks issued by employers to determine the number of people employed. If some employers issued separate paychecks for different types of pay, this would result in an overcount of the number of people employed.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, the government of Country X overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
  The government reported that there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter the program was used.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.

Analysis:
  The new computer program simply tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and uses that figure as its estimate of employment, which means that workers receiving multiple paychecks would be counted multiple times, which could result in inflated employment numbers. Therefore, it is possible that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X.

Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.

However, the argument does not mistakenly believe that the total sales declined. It states that Wilson's hair dryer sales have declined. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  B: Does not provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. This choice is true, but it does not describe why the argument is flawed. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  C: Fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers. There is no mention of any other products. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  D: Overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years. This is a possible scenario that the argument does not consider and it is a flaw in the reasoning. Therefore, this choice is correct.
  E: Provides no independent evidence that Wilson appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. The argument does not mention other products manufactured by Wilson Appliance making this answer irrelevant. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
The argument assumes that the decline in market share for the company's hair dryer is directly responsible for the alleged net income decline. It also assumes that no factors other than market share and income per item sold directly related to the net income decline.

A: The argument assumes that the decline in market share for the company's hair dryer represents a decline in sales of the product.
  B: The argument assumes that income per item sold is the only factor, or at least the main one, in net income calculations.
  C: The argument is only concerned with the hair dryer; it does not discuss the sales figures for the company's other products.
  D: The argument does not address the possibility that changes in retail price may have affected the net income from sales.
  E. The argument offers no indication that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer have declined from 50% to 25% of all hair dryer sales.
  The net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold has remained the same.
  The conclusion is drawn that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  
A: The argument clearly states that the decline is only for Wilson Appliance's product and not for all hair dryers, so this choice is incorrect.
B: The argument is concerned with the net income from sales of the product, so the profitability of the product is implicitly considered. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
C: The argument only discusses the sales figures of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer and not its other products. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
D: The possibility of a price increase of the hair dryer is not discussed in the argument and is irrelevant to the conclusion drawn. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
E: The profitability of the hair dryer is not mentioned in the argument, and the conclusion drawn is related to the decline in net income from sales. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument says that Wilson Appliance's product has declined from 50 percent to 25 percent of the market, which has resulted in a decline in net income. The net income per dryer has not changed over the last 5 years.
A: The argument's reasoning does not mistake a decline in market share for a decline in total sales; it is clear that the argument is talking about market share. The argument does not conflate market share and total sales. 
B: The argument talks about the net income and market share of Wilson Appliance's product, but does not discuss profit related to other company's hair dryers. It is not clear that providing specific information regarding vendor's profits would strengthen or weaken the argument.
C: The argument only discusses hair dryers produced by Wilson Appliance; therefore, it is not necessary to discuss Wilson Appliance's sales figures for other products. 
D: The argument states that the average net income per hair dryer has not changed over the last 5 years, so an increase in retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is unlikely to have affected the net income. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the argument.
E: The argument is about Wilson Appliance's hair dryer; whether or not it is one of the company's least profitable products is beyond the scope of the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument presents the following facts:
  - Five years ago, Wilson Appliance's hair dryer accounted for 50 percent of all hair dryer sales nationwide.
  - Currently, Wilson Appliance's hair dryer only accounts for 25 percent of hair dryer sales.
  - Wilson Appliance's average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed in five years.
  - Therefore, Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of hair dryers must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.

A: The argument is not making this mistake, as it is clear that the percentage of product sold that was Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has declined, not the total number of sales.
B: The argument does not need specific information about profits, as it is concerned only with net income, which is already defined in the argument.
C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for other products as it is only concerned with sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer.
D: The argument overlooks this possibility, but it is not necessary for its conclusion to hold true.
E: The argument provides no evidence about the relative profitability of Wilson Appliance's various products, but this is not necessary for its conclusion to hold true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument is linking a decline in market share with decline in the company's net income from sales of the hair dryer and that the product makes up only 25 percent of such sales currently.
  A: This choice correctly indicates the flaw of mistaking a decline in market share with a decline in the total sales of that product which is not explicitly mentioned in the argument.
  B: This choice is irrelevant to the reasoning presented in the argument.
  C: The sales figures of other products are not relevant to the claim being made in the argument.
  D: Even if the retail price of the hair dryer has increased over 5 years, it assumes no change in the average net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold.
  E: The argument does not present any evidence to suggest that the hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has declined from 50% to 25% over 5 years, but the average net income per hair dryer has not changed, implying that the company's net income has halved.
A: The argument does not conflate the decline in market share with a decline in total sales; it simply asserts that the market share has decreased over the specified time period.
B: The argument assumes, without providing data, that the revenue generated per unit sale has remained constant over the 5-year period.
C: The argument is exclusively relevant to Wilson Appliance's hair dryer product and does not mention any other products.
D: The argument assumes, with no supporting evidence, that the retail price of the hair dryer circulated by Wilson Appliances has not changed in the past five years.
E: The argument fails to provide information that would suggest that the hair dryer product is one of Wilson Appliance's least profitable products.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument assumes that the sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the past 5 years. It also assumes that the net income from the sales of hair dryers is the only significant factor affecting the company's net income. 
A: This is correct. The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryers is due solely to a decrease in the number of hair dryers sold, whereas the decline could also be due to increasing competition from other companies. Therefore, the argument mistakenly identifies a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer with a decline in the total sales of that product.
B: This is incorrect because the argument assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, which implies that the profits generated by the hair dryers have remained constant.
C: This is incorrect because the argument only concerns sales of the company's hair dryers.
D: This is irrelevant because the net income per hair dryer sold has remained constant over the last 5 years.
E: This is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of hair dryers is only half of what it was 5 years ago because the market share has dropped from 50% to 25%, and the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
A: This is correct. The argument assumes that the decline in market share is proportional to the decline in total sales of that product. However, there may have been an increase in sales of hair dryers, but a higher number of alternative suppliers of hair dryers that now account for a growing market share. Therefore, this choice correctly identifies the flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
B: The argument is not concerned with profits earned by hair dryers produced by other companies, and how they compare to those of Wilson Appliance. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the flaw in the argument.
C: The argument is only considering the sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer and how it affects their net income. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the flaw in the argument.
D: The argument assumes that the average net income per dryer sold has remained constant over the last 5 years, so price changes are not relevant to the argument. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the flaw in the argument.
E: The argument is not concerned with which of Wilson Appliance's products generate the least profit. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the flaw in the argument. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide five years ago, but now only accounts for 25% of such sales. It also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. Due to this fact, the argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
A: This is correct. The argument makes the mistake of equating a decline in market share to a decline in total sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer. Therefore, it is flawed in this regard.
  B: The argument does not require any specific information about the profits of hair dryers to reach the conclusion.
  C: The argument is not concerned with any product other than the hair dryer.
  D: The argument does not consider whether the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years. Therefore, it is not flawed in this regard.
  E: The argument does not mention any other products or profitability of Wilson Appliances’ hair dryer; therefore, it is not related to the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Critic: The recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what is of most interest about him. It is by an expert on the history of Elizabethan England, and so does a good job of showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time. But it does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
Question: The conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: There is no way to know what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
  B: The life of the average man in Elizabethan England is uninteresting.
  C: Shakespeare was very different from the other men of his time.
  D: A biography should always focus on what makes its subject distinctive.
  E: What is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The critic is arguing that the recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries despite doing a good job showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time.
A: This is not necessary to assume and is too extreme to be the conclusion of the argument.
B: This is irrelevant and does not impact whether or not the biography explains what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
C: This is too extreme to be the conclusion of the argument and is not supported by the critic's argument.
D: This is an extreme view and not necessary to assume in order for the conclusion to be drawn.
E: This statement is consistent with the critic's argument and supports the conclusion that the biography does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
The conclusion of the argument is that the recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what is of most interest about him which is what made him different from his contemporaries. The missing assumption from the argument is the author's view of what is most interesting about Shakespeare. Therefore, the assumption is that what is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The critic is evaluating a recent biographical work on Shakespeare, and founds that it does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries. The critic appreciated the work and highlights that it does a good job of showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time which is also an interesting aspect but not the focus of the criticism.
A: This option is not the assumption made by the critic. Though it implies that Shakespeare's distinctiveness is unknown as per the argument, it is not a required assumption for the conclusion in the given argument.
B: This option is out of context and is irrelevant to the conclusion drawn by the critic.
C: The argument does not provide any such assumption as the critic is not even sure if Shakespeare was different from his contemporaries.
D: The critic does not provide us with a specific requirement for a biography. Hence this does not seem relevant to the conclusion drawn by the critic.
E: This assumption is already provided in the argument. The critic asserts that what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries is not apparent in the biography of Shakespeare.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The critic argues that the recent Shakespeare biography does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries, but only focuses on what life would have been like for him as a man of his time.
  A: The critic does not say whether or not it's possible to know what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
  B: The critic does not say whether or not the life of the average man in Elizabethan England is uninteresting.
  C: The critic does not make a claim about how different Shakespeare was from his contemporaries.
  D: The critic does not make a claim about how all biographies should be focused.
  E: The critic's argument relies on the assumption that what is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The critic is discussing a recent biography of Shakespeare. The biography does a good job of showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time, but it does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
  
A: This option implies that there is no information about what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries, but this is not necessarily true. We cannot assume this.
B: This option is irrelevant to the argument. The critic is not discussing whether the life of the average man in Elizabethan England is interesting or not.
C: This option is not supported by the argument. The critic does not mention that Shakespeare was very different from the other men of his time.
D: This option is incorrect because the critic is not making a general statement about what a biography should always focus on.
E: This option supports the critic's argument. The critic is arguing that the recent biography does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries, but this is what is most interesting about him. Therefore, we can assume that the conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn if we assume that what is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The critic argues that the recent biography of Shakespeare does a good job of showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time, but it does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
A: This answer choice does not support or reject the critic’s argument.
B: This answer choice is not relevant to the critic's argument.
C: This answer choice is too extreme and goes beyond what the critic is claiming.
D: This answer choice is also too extreme and goes beyond what the critic is claiming. The critic does not say that a biography should ALWAYS focus on what makes its subject distinctive.
E: This answer choice properly summarizes and supports the critic's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The critic argues that the recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what made him different from his contemporaries, even though the book does a good job of showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time.
A: This choice is not relevant because it says there is no way to know what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries. The critic is arguing that the biography did not explain this, not that it is impossible to find out.
B: This choice is not relevant because the critic does not mention whether or not the life of the average man in Elizabethan England is interesting or uninteresting.
C: This choice is too extreme because the critic does not argue that Shakespeare was very different from the other men of his time, only that the biography does not explain what made him different.
D: This choice is not relevant because the critic does not argue that biographies should always focus on what makes its subject distinctive.
E: This choice matches the conclusion of the critic's argument. The critic argues that the recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what is most interesting about him, which is what made him different from his contemporaries.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The critic is evaluating a recent biography of Shakespeare. 
  The biography is written by an expert on the history of Elizabethan England, and it focuses on showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time. 
  The critic argues that the biography does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.

Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
  The critic is arguing that the recent biography of Shakespeare is not satisfying because it does not explain what makes him different from his contemporaries. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn only if we assume that what is most interesting about Shakespeare is precisely what makes him different from his contemporaries. Choice A can be eliminated because it presents an extreme view, and does not support the conclusion of the argument. Choice B can be eliminated because it implies that the recent biography is uninteresting, which is not the main claim of the critic. Choices C and D can also be eliminated because they make assumptions that go beyond the evidence provided in the argument.
Response 8:
The conclusion of the argument is that the recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what is most interesting about him. The argument suggests that the biography only touches on his life as a man of that time, but fails to highlight what sets him apart from his contemporaries. 
Knowledge:
  A: This choice may be true, but it is irrelevant to the argument since it does not help explain why the biography's focus is inadequate or why it fails to showcase Shakespeare's uniqueness.
  B: This choice is irrelevant to the argument since it pertains to the interest level of the average man's life in Elizabethan England, not the interest level of Shakespeare's life. 
  C: This choice is not supported by the given information, and even if it were true, the argument is not discussing the extent to which Shakespeare differed from his contemporaries. Rather, it is discussing the fact that the biography does not explain what made Shakespeare different from them. 
  D: This choice is too extreme. The argument does not suggest that all biographies should always focus only on what makes its subject distinctive. 
  E: This choice aligns with the conclusion of the argument that what is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The critic believes that the recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries, but is good at showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time.
  
A: This contradicts the critic's argument, as it implies that it is impossible to explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
  B: This has no relation to the argument.
  C: This is too extreme, and there is no evidence for it in the argument.
  D: This contradicts the critic's argument, as it implies that a biography should always focus on what makes its subject distinctive.
  E: This confirms the critic's argument, as it states that what is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species found in some islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, because these islands are located far from the Americas and long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  A: Some animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas, but this fact does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about the iguana species.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, but this fact does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument, especially if the differences can be explained by subsequent evolution.
  C: If documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances are uncommon, this fact would strengthen the scientist's argument, because it would make the possibility of accidental rafting more unlikely.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia. If true, this fact would weaken the scientist's argument, because it would indicate that the progenitors of these species could have come from Australia instead of the Americas.
  E: The fact that the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana does not weaken or support the scientist's argument about the iguana species or their progenitors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The scientist argues that the iguana species on the small group of islands near Australia rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas since the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
A: This statement, in fact, strengthens the argument, as it suggests that the species are unique to the islands and not found in the Americas.
B: This statement does not weaken the scientist's argument unless it suggests that the genetic difference is too great to have been caused by rafting. 
C: The rarity of documented cases does not necessarily mean they do not occur and therefore does not weaken the argument.
D: This statement does not weaken the argument but rather supports it further.
E: This statement, which suggests that certain lineages date back to before the fragmentation of Gondwana, weakens the argument by casting doubt on the likelihood that the species rafted across the Pacific Ocean.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
	The scientist concludes that the iguanas that inhabit a small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana and closely related species exist in the Americas, but nowhere else.
	A: This information doesn't weaken the conclusion that the iguanas rafted from the Americas because of the presence of other animal species on the islands that aren't found in the Americas.
	B: If the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, then it implies that they didn't raft across the Pacific from the Americas, which weakens the scientist's argument.
	C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting does not necessarily negate the possibility of them rafting as the biologist suggested, so this does not weaken the biologist’s argument.
	D: Fossils found in Australia suggest that closely related species to those in the islands lived in Australia too. This in no way weakens the scientist's argument that the iguanas rafted from the Americas.
	E: The age of the lineages of numerous plant species does not necessarily negate the possibility of the iguanas rafting. The plants may have been carried across the ocean by other means such as wind or ocean currents. This does not weaken the scientist's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species found on a small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  A: This argument is about the iguana species, not other animal species.
  B: This statement counters the claim that the species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris from the Americas and instead indicates that the iguana species on the islands have evolved differently than those found in the Americas.
  C: This statement does not directly affect the argument.
  D: This statement seems to support the argument.
  E: This statement is about numerous plant and animal species and does not directly affect the argument about the iguana species.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument implies that the iguanas on the islands came from the Americas.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: If the iguanas on the islands and the iguanas in the Americas are genetically different, it would suggest that they may not be from a common ancestor and therefore, the iguanas on the islands may not have come from the Americas.
  C: The argument does not rely on how often iguanas are known to raft between land masses.
  D: This statement would support the argument, not weaken it.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The scientist is arguing that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: The presence or absence of other animal species on the islands is not directly related to the argument about how the iguana species got there.
  B: Genetic differences between the iguana species on the islands and those in the Americas do not necessarily negate the possibility of rafting across the ocean as an explanation for how they got there. 
  C: The fact that other documented cases of iguanas rafting between land masses are uncommon does not undermine the possibility that it could have happened in this instance.
  D: Fossils of closely related iguana species in Australia do not directly relate to how the iguana species got to the islands near Australia.
  E: The fact that some lineages of plant and animal species in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana does not necessarily preclude the possibility of rafting across the ocean as an explanation for how these iguana species got to the islands near Australia.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the species of iguana on the small islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  
  A: This statement is irrelevant and does not address the argument.
  B: If genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, it would weaken the argument that the species on the island came from the Americas.
  C: This statement is irrelevant and does not address the argument.
  D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, it would weaken the argument that the species on the island came from the Americas.
  E: This statement is irrelevant and does not address the argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The scientist argues that the species must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, it seems that the species could not have spread over the land bridge that once connected South America and Antarctica to Australia.
A: This choice doesn't necessarily weaken the argument because not all animal species are expected to be found in both the Americas and the islands near Australia. The focus is on the iguana species.
B: This choice also doesn't necessarily weaken the argument. The fact that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas does not rule out the possibility that they came to the islands from the Americas via rafting on floating debris.
C: This choice merely raises a concern about the plausibility of the rafting hypothesis for iguana species. However, the lack of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses is not evidence that the rafting hypothesis is wrong.
D: The fact that fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, a continent that was part of Gondwana, undermines the central argument that the iguanas could not have migrated to Australia before the fragmentation of Gondwana.
E: This choice also undermines the premise of the argument, because if the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, this indicates that there was a way for these lineages to spread between those continents despite the fragmentation. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the iguana species on a group of islands near Australia came from the Americas by rafting on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean.
  A: This information is irrelevant to the argument being made.
  B: If genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, this weakens the possibility that they are related and came over by rafting.
  C: The uncommonness of documented cases of iguanas rafting does not disprove the possibility that these iguanas came over by rafting on debris.
  D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, this indicates that those species could have originated in Australia, rather than coming from the Americas.
  E: This information is irrelevant to the argument being made.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, because these islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, and such closely related species exist in the Americas but nowhere else.
A: The fact that some animal species on the islands are not found in the Americas does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas arrived on the islands.
B: If genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, it casts doubt on the hypothesis that the islands' iguanas rafted across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
C: The fact that documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas arrived on the islands. It is possible that the rareness of such events makes them all the more remarkable.
D: The fact that fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia is irrelevant to the scientist's argument that the ancestor of the iguanas on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
E: The fact that the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana is irrelevant to the current argument about how the iguanas arrived on the islands.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety. They cite studies conducted 30 years ago that support their claim.
Choices:
A: Describes the editorialist's argument, but does not identify a flaw.
B: Suggests a possibility for why the editorialist's conclusion may not be true, but does not identify a flaw in their argument.
C: Does not identify a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
D: Identifies a flaw in the editorialist's argument: the editorialist confuses the lack of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic beyond its capacity with evidence against the claim.
E: Suggests an alternative perspective, but does not identify a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The editorialist's argument claims that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's design capacity will decrease safety because studies indicate this happened in every airport that allowed such traffic 30 years ago.
  A: This does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  B: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument because the argument does not address the latest technology's impact on the airport's permitting air traffic beyond its design capacity.
  C: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument, and it is not stated that city council members are aware of the studies conducted 30 years ago.
  D: This is the best answer. The editorialist concludes that because several council members say the latest safety technology would accompany the increased air traffic, this would decrease safety. The fact that studies conducted 30 years ago show the opposite happens does not mean it IS happening now. It is also not clear that the latest safety technology does not help increase capacity safely.
  E: This is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, despite accompanying purchase of latest safety technology.
A: This does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
B: This argument presents an alternative possibility that airports can handle more traffic safely with certain technology, but does not point out a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
C: This does not describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument, but rather suggests that the city council members may have a counterargument.
D: This accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument assumes that the studies conducted 30 years ago are applicable today and does not address whether new evidence or technology may have mitigated the risks described.
E: This does not describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, based on studies conducted 30 years ago that show the same effect.
A: This choice describes a flaw where a conclusion is made based on a limited number of instances, but this does not apply to the argument.
B: This choice describes a possibility that is not relevant to the argument, which is solely based on the studies conducted 30 years ago.
C: This choice describes a possibility where the city council members are aware of the studies, but this does not address the argument's claim that increasing air traffic would decrease safety.
D: This choice accurately reflects the flaw in the argument by pointing out that the editorialist confuses an absence of evidence with evidence against the claim.
E: This choice raises a possibility that is not directly relevant to the argument that increasing air traffic would decrease safety.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The editorialist argues that an increase in air traffic at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety, despite the purchase of the latest safety technology. The editorialist cites past studies conducted on airports that allowed more air traffic than their original design capacity, which resulted in decreased safety.
  
A: This statement does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  
B: The argument does not mention considering the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  
C: The argument acknowledges that the council members supporting the increase believe that the latest safety technology will prevent a decrease in safety. However, it questions this claim based on past studies.
  
D: This statement accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist assumes that the absence of evidence for the safety claim against the increase in air traffic is the evidence that the increase is unsafe. But this does not address the question of whether the safety technology will mitigate the risks in the current context.
  
E: This statement does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist in the passage argues that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety. The council members, however, say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. The editorialist then claims that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
A: This is not applicable as the argument does not draw a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
B: This is not applicable as the argument does not fail to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
C: This is not applicable as the argument does not consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
D: This is the correct answer. The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim as the editorialist claims that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology. 
E: This is not applicable as the argument does not consider the possibility that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Conclusion: The city council's proposal to increase the amount of air traffic would decrease safety.
  Premise: Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.
  The argument does not provide any information that suggests that the condition that existed 30 years ago is still relevant now.
  The argument does not consider the possibility that the latest safety technology may have improved.
  The argument does not address the possibility that safety might be reduced at different levels of traffic increase.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The flaw in the editorialist's argument is that it confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim. The argument highlights that studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity. However, it does not provide any evidence that refutes the claim that the latest safety technology could enable the airport to permit air traffic above the original design capacity safely.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety based on studies conducted 30 years ago that showed reduced safety at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when latest safety technology was used.
A: The editorialist's argument is based on a general statement that was inferred from a limited number of instances and studies.
B: The editorialist's argument acknowledges the use of the latest safety technology, but argues that the studies conducted 30 years ago still apply.
C: The possibility that the city council members may be aware of the studies conducted 30 years ago does not address the validity of the argument.
D: This most accurately describes the flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist confuses the absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
E: The editorialist's argument does not consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The flaw in the editorialist's argument is that it fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is. The argument assumes that the latest safety technology would not be enough to prevent safety reduction, based on studies conducted 30 years ago, without considering whether the safety technology has improved since then. Thus, the argument jumps to an unfounded conclusion.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The editorialist argues that increasing the air traffic would decrease safety and contradicts the view of some council members who think that the latest safety technology will compensate for the increased traffic. However, the editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago that show otherwise.

A: The editorialist did not make a general statement from a limited number of instances, but cites studies to support the claim.
B: This choice suggests that safety might increase with the purchase of the latest technology, which is not what the studies show.
C: This choice is not relevant to the flaw in the editorialist's argument.
D: The editorialist supports the claim of decrease in safety based on previous studies, not the absence of evidence.
E: The issue of whether slight increase in safety risks is acceptable is beyond the scope of the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychiatrist: Take any visceral emotion you care to consider. There are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion. So, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Anger is always expressible.
  B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: Some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express.
  D: All emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: An emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The argument claims that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express visceral emotions. Then, it specifically states that this implies that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express anger.
A: This statement is not necessarily assumed in the argument, as the conclusion talks about expressing anger in particular, not all emotions.
B: The argument assumes that anger is a visceral emotion, and this is explicitly stated in the premises.
C: This statement contradicts the argument and is not assumed.
D: The argument does not assume this statement, as it only claims that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express visceral emotions, without saying that all healthy-to-express emotions are visceral.
E: This statement is not assumed in the argument and goes against the premise that there are always healthy ways to express visceral emotions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that for any visceral emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion, and therefore, the conclusion is made that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  A: This is too extreme of a statement and it is unsupported by the argument. Therefore, this cannot be assumed.
  B: This statement is supported by the argument and is necessary for the argument to make sense. Expressing anger is healthy because anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. The argument states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to express an emotion, not that all emotions should be expressed regardless of whether they are healthy or not.
  D: This statement is not supported by the argument and it is too extreme. Just because an emotion is healthy to express does not necessarily mean that it is visceral.
  E: This statement is too extreme. The argument only states that if an emotion is visceral, then there are situations in which it is healthy to express it, not that an emotion is only visceral if it is healthy to express it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that visceral emotions can always be expressed in a healthy way, so there are always healthy ways of expressing anger.
  A: The argument does not imply that anger is always expressible. Also, the conclusion is not primarily about the expressibility of anger.
  B: The argument relies on the claim that anger is a visceral emotion. Accepting this assumption, it follows that there are always healthy ways of expressing anger.
  C: If some emotions are unhealthy to express, it does not follow that there are no healthy ways of expressing anger. Hence, this assumption does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  D: The argument does not suggest that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral. Hence, this assumption does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  E: This assumption suggests that any emotion that is not visceral cannot be expressed in a healthy way. But this does not follow from the premises of the argument. Also, the conclusion is not merely about the relationship between visceral emotions and healthy expression.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument given is that there is always a situation in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, including anger.

A: The argument does not require the assumption that anger is always expressible in order for the conclusion to follow, so this choice is not correct.

B: The argument assumes that anger is a visceral emotion, so this choice is correct.

C: The argument does not require the assumption that some emotions are unhealthy to express in order for the conclusion to follow, so this choice is not correct.

D: The argument does not require the assumption that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral in order for the conclusion to follow, so this choice is not correct.

E: The argument does not require the assumption that an emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express in order for the conclusion to follow, so this choice is not correct.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
Anger is a visceral emotion, which means it is experienced in the gut and other bodily organs.
The Psychiatrist claims that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion.
 
Analysis:
Psychiatrist argues that there are situations where it is healthy to express any visceral emotion, and since anger is a visceral emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to express anger. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument follows logically if we assume that anger is always expressible.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion. The psychiatrist also gives anger as an example of a visceral emotion and concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger. 
  A: The argument does not claim that anger is always expressible. 
  B: This is true. The argument states that anger is a visceral emotion and concludes that it is healthy to express this emotion in some situations.
  C: This contradicts the argument. The argument claims that for any visceral emotion, including anger, there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express the emotion. 
  D: The argument only states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, but it does not claim that all emotions that are healthy to express must be visceral. 
  E: The argument does not claim that an emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The argument is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger, and that any visceral emotion can be validly expressed in some situations.
A: This statement is not necessary for the conclusion to logically follow.
B: This statement is a premise of the argument, and if true, supports the conclusion.
C: This statement contradicts the premise of the argument and weakens the conclusion.
D: This statement goes beyond what is needed to logically support the conclusion.
E: This statement is not necessary for the conclusion to logically follow.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument is: there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger. Since every visceral emotion can be expressed in some situation, the psychiatrist concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion.
  
A: The argument does not assume that anger is always expressible.
B: Correct. The argument assumes that anger is a visceral emotion in order to conclude that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion.
C: The argument states the opposite: that for any emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express it.
D: The argument does not assume that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
E: The argument does not assume that an emotion must be visceral in order to be healthy to express. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The argument is saying that no matter what visceral emotion someone may have, there are situations in which it is healthy to express that emotion. The argument specifically mentions anger as an example of a visceral emotion that can always be expressed in a healthy way.
A: The argument does not say that anger is always expressible, nor does it depend on this assumption.
B: This assumption is necessary for the argument to be valid, as the argument specifically mentions anger as an example of a visceral emotion and states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion.
C: This assumption does not necessarily follow from the argument nor is it relevant to the conclusion.
D: The argument does not make this generalization, it only makes a claim about visceral emotions.
E: This statement is not explicitly mentioned in the argument, nor is it necessary for the conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The argument states that there are situations where it is healthy to express any visceral emotion, and therefore it is healthy in any situation to try to express one's anger.
A: The argument doesn't state that anger is always expressible. It only assumes that there are situations in which it is healthy to express one's anger.
B: The argument clearly states that anger is a visceral emotion, so this assumption is already given in the argument.
C: This is opposite to the argument's claim, which states that there are situations where it is healthy to express any visceral emotion.
D: The argument doesn't assume that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral, as there may be other healthy ways to express emotions.
E: This is incorrect, as some emotions may not be healthy to express even if they are visceral.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Knowledge: The argument claims that designated bike lanes don't enhance safety for cyclists based on statistics that show more collisions occur between bikes and motor vehicles on roads with designated bike lanes than on roads without such lanes.
A: This response is somewhat related to the argument, but it does not align with the conclusion drawn in the argument. The conclusion states that adding designated bike lanes will not enhance safety for bicyclists. There is no mention in the argument whether accidents are less serious or more serious - this response is not directly relevant.
B: The argument does not address the possibility of more bicyclists riding on roads with bike lanes than those without them. This option is irrelevant to the argument.
C: This response is related to the argument. The argument assumes that greater safety for bicyclists will always result in greater safety for motorists. This assumption might not be true and is the weak point in the argument.
D: This response is incorrect because the argument assumes that the bicycle lanes that already exist on roads with accidents are safer than no lanes. It does not conclude that only some roads that have designated bike lanes are safe.
E: This option suggests that the argument draws the opposite conclusion from what the statistical evidence indicates. But the argument states that adding designated bike lanes to roads is unlikely to enhance bicyclist safety. Therefore, this response is not applicable in this context.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument suggests that adding specifically designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, and the reason behind this is that the statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads where bicycle lanes currently exist.
A: The argument does not address the severity of the injuries sustained by bicyclists during accidents, nor does it relate this to the statistical evidence provided in the argument.
B: The number of bicyclists riding on roads with and without bicycle lanes is not discussed in the argument.
C: The argument does not say that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
D: This answer choice is the opposite of the reasoning provided in the argument. The argument provides the evidence that adding bicycle lanes to roads doesn't enhance the safety of bicyclists.
E: This answer choice is also the opposite of the reasoning provided in the argument. The argument relies solely on the statistical evidence to make a claim that adding bicycle lanes to roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because bicycles and motor vehicles have more collisions on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes, according to statistics.
  A: This statement is relevant to the argument, but it does not criticize the argument directly.
  B: This statement is relevant to the argument, but it does not criticize the argument directly.
  C: This statement may be a valid criticism of the argument because the argument takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists, which may not be true.
  D: This statement is not accurate because the argument does not state that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
  E: This statement is not accurate because the argument does not use statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because there are more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads having such lanes. This implies that roads with designated bicycle lanes are not safer than roads without such lanes.
A: This option is irrelevant to the argument's claim that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because it only talks about the seriousness of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes compared to roads without such lanes.
B: This option is irrelevant to the argument's claim that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because it only talks about the number of bicyclists riding on roads with or without designated bicycle lanes.
C: This option is irrelevant to the argument's claim that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because it only talks about the safety of motorists in contrast to bicyclists.
D: This option criticizes the argument for a different reason. The argument doesn't conclude that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists because only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
E: This option is the opposite of the argument. The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because there are more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads having such lanes. Option E says that the argument takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument suggests that adding bicycle lanes to roads won't enhance the safety of bicyclists, despite the fact that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads with bicycle lanes. 
A: This is not a relevant criticism because the argument is not based on the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists, but rather on the likelihood of accidents occurring.
B: This is not a relevant criticism because the argument is based on the number of collisions, not the number of bicyclists or motor vehicles.
C: This is not a relevant criticism because the argument is focused on the safety of bicyclists, not the safety of motorists.
D: This is a possible criticism because the argument assumes that all roads with bike lanes are similarly unsafe, which may not be true.
E: This is a possible criticism because the argument assumes that the statistical evidence proves the opposite conclusion, which is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the statistic that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes than without them.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement might reinforce the argument, but it is not enough to criticize the argument.
  C: This statement also might challenge the argument, but it doesn't point out the statistical flaw in the argument.
  D: This statement may reveal the flaw in the argument because the statistic is not enough to conclude whether adding bicycle lanes to other roads that don't have them will enhance or not the safety of bicyclists on those roads.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the conclusion that the argument seeks to draw.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists. 
  A: This option raises a concern about the severity of the injuries but does not directly challenge the argument that adding such lanes is unlikely to enhance safety.
  B: This option talks about the number of bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes and those who do not, which is irrelevant to the argument.
  C: This option raises a concern about whether the alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists, but this too is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: This option is not valid because the argument does not make a claim about the safety of roads that currently have bicycle lanes. It tries to put forward the idea that adding new designated bicycle lanes is unlikely to enhance safety.
  E: This option is the closest to the valid criticism since the argument considers statistical evidence that reveals more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads containing designated bicycle lanes and concludes that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that adding bike lanes is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the statistic that there are more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads with bike lanes than on roads without bike lanes.
  
A: This criticism is not relevant as the argument is not concerned with the severity of injuries but with the number of collisions.  
B: This is not a criticism of the argument but an alternative possibility that may support the argument.  
C: This criticism is not relevant as the argument is not claiming that enhancing the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.  
D: This criticism is not relevant as the argument is not based on the assumption that currently existing bike lanes are safe.  
E: This criticism is a possible vulnerability as it questions the validity of the statistical evidence presented in the argument.  

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  A: This choice concerns the seriousness of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents. The argument does not address this possibility, but it is not relevant to the conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  B: This choice concerns the possibility of more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than on roads without such lanes. The argument does not address this possibility, but it is not relevant to the conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  C: This choice concerns the assumption that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists. This assumption is not made by the argument. However, it is not relevant to the conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  D: This choice misrepresents the argument. The argument does not claim that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe. The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  E: This choice misrepresents the argument. The argument does not take statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion. The argument cites statistics that suggest that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because the statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. 

A: The argument is not concerned with the level of severity of injuries on roads with bicycle lanes versus those without such lanes, but rather with the frequency of accidents. 
B: The argument does not address the number of bicyclists using roads with or without bicycle lanes.
C: The argument assumes that anything that enhances the safety of bicyclists enhances the safety of motorists, but this assumption is not relevant to the conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
D: The argument's conclusion is not based on the assumption that only some roads that currently have bicycle lanes are safe. 
E: This answer is close, but it is not a perfect match. The argument does take statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that seemingly contradicts the conclusion. However, it does not claim that the opposite conclusion is true.

  The statement above posits that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
  A: This choice provides an unrelated fact about insect vision.
  B: This choice is also an unrelated fact, as it does not provide any information that supports the statement above.
  C: This choice is also an unrelated fact, as it does not provide any information that supports the statement above.
  D: In order to support the statement above, we need to identify a fact that supports flower development in response to bee vision. This choice provides a fact about bees relying on nonflowering plants.
  E: This choice provides support for the statement by indicating that bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that flowers likely developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
  A: This statement provides evidence that many insects with similar vision to bees do not depend on color, but it does not relate to flowers or explain how their evolutionary development was influenced.
  B: The fact that some flowers rely on insects other than bees does not support or refute the argument.
  C: The number of different species of flowers being greater than the number of different species of bees does not necessarily support or undermine the argument.
  D: This statement provides information about the importance of bees in plant reproduction, but it does not relate to how flowers and bees co-evolved.
  E: This statement demonstrates the exclusive reliance of bees on flowers, but it does not directly relate to the co-evolution of flowers and bees which is under discussion.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The statement asserts that it is likely that flowers developed to meet the visual needs of bees, rather than bees adapting to flower colors. Thus, the correct answer choice will provide evidence that supports this assertion.
A: The fact that other insects are able to see the colors of flowers, but do not rely on flower colors to identify flowers, does not directly support the statement.
B: While some flowers may rely on insects other than bees, this does not imply they did not develop in response to bees' visual needs.
C: The fact that there are more species of flowers than bees does not provide support for the statement in question.
D: The fact that many nonflowering plants rely on bees is not relevant to the statement.
E: The fact that bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food does not provide support for the statement that flowers developed to meet the visual needs of bees.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about whether flowers evolved based on bees' vision or whether bees' vision adapted to see the color of flowers.
  A: This fact may weaken the argument because it shows that many insects with similar vision to bees, do not depend on perceiving an object's color, which means that perhaps other factors could have influenced the evolution of flowers.
  B: This is irrelevant to the argument because it only shows that some flowers rely on insects other than bees, but it does not address the argument of which evolved first.
  C: This also weakens the argument because it shows that there are more different species of flowers than of bees, which implies that flowers have perhaps evolved for reasons other than bees.
  D: This is irrelevant to the argument because it is about non-flowering plants.
  E: This choice is irrelevant to the argument because it only deals with the current relationship between flowers and bees.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The statement claims that flowers developed to suit bees' vision, rather than bees' vision changing to suit flower color.
  A: This statement is not directly related to whether flower color evolved to suit bees' vision or the other way around.
  B: Since some flowers rely on insects other than bees, it is less likely that all flowers developed just to attract bees.
  C: The number of different species of flower or bees is not relevant to the development of vision or flower color.
  D: This statement is not directly related to whether flower color evolved to suit bees' vision or the other way around.
  E: This statement strengthens the idea that bees and flowers have a mutualistic relationship.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The statement above suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: This statement is not directly related to the development of flowers in response to bees' vision.
  B: If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, it would weaken the hypothesis that flowers evolved in response to bees' vision. Therefore, this statement does not support the statement above.
  C: This statement is also not directly related to the hypothesis that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  D: This statement suggests that bees play an important role in the ecology of many plant species, but it is not directly related to the hypothesis that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  E: This statement does support the hypothesis that bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, which would make it more likely that flowers evolved in response to bees' vision.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The statement above suggests that flowers developed according to the bees' visual capabilities.
  A: This undermines the statement above, as other insects with similar vision don't depend on object color.
  B: This statement is not related to the development of flower color as it only talks about some flowers relying on other insects.
  C: The number of different species of flowers being greater than bees is not related to the statement that suggests flowers developed according to bees' vision.
  D: This statement does not support or undermine the statement above.
  E: This statement is more likely a possible conclusion from the initial statement, and it doesn't support nor undermine it.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The statement suggests the following:
    1. Bees' vision is well-suited to identifying flowers by their colors.
    2. Flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
    3. It is improbable that bees' vision developed in response to flower color.
  A: The fact that other insects do not depend on perceiving an object's color does not necessarily support the statement.
  B: If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, it does not necessarily support or contradict the statement.
  C: The number of different species of flowers being greater than the number of different species of bees is an interesting fact, but it does not support the statement.
  D: While this fact provides evidence of a relationship between bees and nonflowering plants, it does not support the statement.
  E: If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, then this would support the statement suggesting a relationship between bees and flowers.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The statement claims that it is probable that flowers developed in response to bees' vision. In other words, it attributes the origin of flower color to the ability of bees to see them. Thus, the correct answer should show that bee vision directed the course of the flowers' evolution.
  A: This choice states that many insects with bee-like vision do not depend on object color. The fact that some insects do not rely on color information does not strongly support the claim made in the statement above.
  B: This choice indicates that some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This fact is irrelevant to the information in the statement above and does not strongly support the claim that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  C: This choice shows that the number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. However, this information does not strongly support the claim that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  D: This choice indicates that many nonflowering plants rely on bees. The fact that many nonflowering plants rely on bees is irrelevant and does not strongly support the claim that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  E: This choice states that present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This fact implies that there must be a coevolution between flowers and bees. Thus, this choice most strongly supports the statement made in the question.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
The argument presents a trade-off: adopting a healthier diet based on fishing has good health benefits; however, it might cause the extinction of marine species, which would make the diet impossible to sustain. Therefore, the argument concludes that universal adoption of this kind of diet should not be recommended.

A: The argument presents a trade-off between the good effect and the potential harms of a course of action. However, unlike the original argument, this kind of reasoning relies on the safety and effectiveness of taking vitamin E, instead of a trade-off between the good effect and potential harms.
B: The argument presents a trade-off that might affect the original intention of a policy action, but it depends on the circumstances, not a trade-off between a good effect and a potential harm.
C: The argument presents a trade-off between the good effect of saving money and the harmful effect of creating a recession. Similarly, the original argument presents a trade-off between the good outcome of a healthy diet and the potential harm of making it unsustainable to maintain.
D: The argument presents a reason why legislators dedicate so much time to campaigning. However, unlike the original argument, there is no trade-off between a good and harm that legislators are weighing. 
E: The argument presents a trade-off: wilderness areas benefit some species through protection while reducing the proliferation of some other species that might thrive better in developed areas. This is similar to the original argument's trade-off between a good outcome and a potentially devastating impact.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument states that a fish-based diet is healthier than a red meat-based one, but if everyone were to adopt it, it would lead to the extinction of the species of fish on which the diet is based. Hence, such a diet should not be recommended for universal adoption.

A: According to this argument, taking a vitamin E supplement reduces one's risk of heart attack, but it has not yet been proves that taking a vitamin E supplement is safe for all people. Therefore, one should not recommend that everyone takes vitamin E supplements every day. The argument is different from the one in the question stem since the argument talks about safety concerns, while the question stem considers the impact of universal adoption.

B: Governments are encouraged to tax tobacco heavily and allocate the revenue to education to discourage smoking. However, if taxes become too high and people begin to smoke less, education funding may be reduced. This argument does not resemble the reasoning in the question since it doesn't discuss the impact of universal adoption of the recommended behavior.

C: This argument states that a consumer is better off investing in his/her future by limiting purchases to what he/she needs and saving the rest. However, if everyone adopts this pattern, it could cause a recession making savings impossible, putting a financial burden on most people. The argument is similar to the one in the question as it discusses a situation in which universal adoption is negatively impacted.

D: This argument discusses how legislators would have more time to do their jobs if they campaign less, but if they don't campaign, they won't get re-elected, so they must campaign. This argument is distinct from those in the question because it doesn't discuss universal adoption or consequences.

E: This argument explains that if we restrict lands' development in wilderness areas, it helps preserve many of the species that live there. However, restricting lands' development in wilderness areas can reduce the proliferation of species like deer found in non-wilderness areas. The argument is similar to the question stem's problem since it discusses a dilemma that emerges from universal adoption of a practice that will affect the environment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument in the passage states that adopting a certain diet could cause most of the marine species on which it is based to become extinct, making the diet impossible. So, recommending universal adoption of such a diet should not be advocated. 
A: This argument also discusses the possibility of harm not being conclusively established, but not making the recommendation on the basis of caution.
B: This argument introduces the possibility of long-term changes making a good solution ultimately unfeasible, which is not the same reasoning as that used in the passage.
C: This argument posits that advocating a change that leads to economic recession for everyone will not be beneficial, which is not the same reasoning as that used in the passage.
D: This argument discusses the difficulty of changing a system that may not ultimately be beneficial to those within that system, which is not the same reasoning as that used in the passage.
E: This argument also discusses a trade-off to preserving wilderness areas, but not the same type of trade-off as in the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument proposes that a particular type of diet is beneficial for health but should not be universally adopted to avoid ecological problems. 
A: The argument involves evidence supporting a certain beneficial activity but with concerns over safety, but the conclusion is different from the argument.
B: The argument refers to a taxation policy on tobacco and how it may affect education funding. The conclusion is also tangential to the argument.
C: The argument refers to an individual's spending pattern, which may lead to collective economic consequences. However, the conclusion is not entirely similar to the argument.
D: The argument discusses campaign time for legislators and suggests that the amount of time spent campaigning leads legislators to successfully retain their seats.
E: The argument refers to restricting land development to preserve wilderness areas but highlights the potential for ecological changes in non-wilderness areas through a butterfly effect.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a trade-off between human health and the survival of marine species. 
  A: This argument presents a concern about the safety of a supplement, but there is no trade-off being presented between different factors in the argument. 
  B: This argument also presents a trade-off, but it is not between two factors that are inherently desirable like health and survival, rather it is between two undesirable outcomes. 
  C: This argument presents a similar concern for a trade-off between an individual's welfare and the health of an economy.
  D: This argument presents a causal relationship rather than a trade-off between two desirable outcomes.
  E: This argument presents a similar trade-off in which an act can have both desirable and undesirable outcomes. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
The argument states that a diet based on fish protein is healthy, but universal adoption of such a diet would lead to the extinction of marine species. Therefore, the argument concludes that the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.

A: The argument discusses the potential health benefits and risks of a vitamin E supplement, concluding that not everyone should take them. It is not closely related to the argument above, which is about the environmental impact of a certain diet.

B: The argument discusses the possible unintended consequences of taxing tobacco. It is not closely related to the argument above, which is about the environmental impact of a certain diet.

C: The argument discusses the benefits of limiting purchases and investing in savings, but states that universal adoption could lead to economic problems. This is closely related to the argument above, which is about the impact of a universal diet on the environment.

D: The argument discusses the motivations behind legislator's campaigning, but has little relevance to the argument above.

E: The argument discusses the impact of designating wilderness areas on wildlife populations. It is not closely related to the argument above, which discusses the impact of a certain diet on marine species.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that a certain diet (fish protein-based) is healthier than another (red-meat protein-based), but universal adoption of that diet may lead to the extinction of marine species. Hence, the diet is not recommended to everyone.
A: The argument talks about the absence of conclusive evidence for the safety of a vitamin supplement and therefore recommends against its universal adoption.
B: The argument talks about excessive taxation reducing tobacco consumption and thereby reducing revenue generated for education. 
C: The argument talks about limiting purchases to what is truly needed being better for the consumer. However, if everyone did this, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession. Hence, this spending pattern is not recommended.
D: The argument talks about the reasons legislators spend so much time campaigning and does not closely resemble the argument above.
E: The argument talks about the pros and cons of land development in wilderness areas and it is not closely related to the argument above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument presents a situation where adopting a healthy diet based on protein from fish is not sustainable for preserving marine species that serve as a source of that protein. Thus, universal adoption of such a diet is not recommended.

A: This argument is about the safety of vitamin E supplements and how they shouldn't be recommended for everyone because it hasn't been conclusively proven to be safe for everyone.
B: This argument is about government tax policies on tobacco and education, and how high taxes may reduce funding for education, so other sources of income should be found.
C: This argument is about a pattern of spending and saving money and how if everyone did this, it may lead to a recession making such practices impossible.
D: This argument is about the time spent campaigning by legislators, and how if they spend less time campaigning, they may not get reelected in the future.
E: This argument is about wilderness and land development, and how wilderness preservation reduces the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas, creating uncertainty about the areas that should be considered wilderness areas.

Action: Answer (E)
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a tradeoff between what is healthy and what is possible.
  A: The argument talks about safety concerns when recommending a supplement.
  B: The argument discusses the unintended consequence of reducing funding for education.
  C: The argument presents a tradeoff between what is good for individuals and what is good for the economy.
  D: The argument talks about an expected outcome of campaigning less.
  E: The argument presents a tradeoff between preserving wilderness areas and reducing population of certain species.

Context: Over the last few decades, public outcries against pollution have brought about stricter regulations of emissions. The cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. This would not have happened without these stricter regulations.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the statements above?
Choices:
  A: In the city with the worst air pollution today, the air quality is better than it was 30 years ago.
  B: No city has worse air pollution today than it did 30 years ago.
  C: Most of the public outcries against pollution came from people in the cities that had the most polluted air.
  D: The most polluted cities today are not the cities that were the most polluted 30 years ago.
  E: Public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
The statement suggests that stricter regulations brought about improvement in air quality in cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. The statement implies that public outcries against pollution were directed at these cities with the most polluted air 30 years ago, which led to the implementation of these stricter regulations. Therefore, it is safe to say that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. None of the other answer choices can be properly inferred from the given statements.

Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage states that over the last few decades, public outcries against pollution have brought about stricter regulations of emissions, and that the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. The inference that can be drawn from this information is that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that public outcries against pollution have led to stricter regulations of emissions and that as a result, the air quality in cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago has greatly improved.
A: The passage does not give enough information to infer whether the city with the worst air pollution today has better air quality than it did 30 years ago.
B: The passage does not support this inference. It only mentions that cities with the most polluted air 30 years ago have greatly improved air quality due to stricter regulations.
C: The passage does not provide information to support this inference. It only mentions that public outcries against pollution brought about stricter regulations of emissions.
D: The passage does not provide information to support this inference.
E: This is the correct inference as stated in the passage. Public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago through stricter regulations of emissions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
The passage states that over the last few decades, public outcries against pollution have brought about stricter regulations of emissions. These regulations have led to the improved air quality in cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Based on this information:
Action: Answer("E")  
The correct answer is E because it states that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago, which is supported in the passage.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

The statements suggest that stricter regulations of emissions have been brought about over the last few decades due to public outcries against pollution. They also suggest that, as a result of these regulations, the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. Therefore, it can be inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. This is expressed in option E. Options A, B, C and D are not supported by the statements above.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  The statements indicate that there have been public outcries against pollution.
  The statements say that there have been regulations to control emissions in the last few decades.
  The statements suggest that the cities with the worst pollution 30 years ago have significantly improved air quality today.
  
Inference:
  The statements suggest that the public outcries against pollution have led to regulations, which in turn led to an improvement in air quality in the cities with the most polluted air 30 years ago. 
  Answer choice E correctly infers this. 
  Answer choice A and D cannot be inferred since the statements do not provide information about the most polluted city today or the city with the worst air quality.
  Answer choice B is incorrect as the statements don't provide information to determine this.
  Answer choice C is unsupported as the statements don't say where the majority of public outcry came from and doesn't address the effectiveness of the regulations.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

The statements suggest that stricter regulations were put in place to combat air pollution, and that has led to an improvement in air quality. The regulations were likely put in place because of public outcries against pollution. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that public criticism led to an improvement in air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. Choice E correctly states this.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
The first two sentences suggest that stricter regulations on emissions led to improved air quality in cities that were previously heavily polluted. This suggests a causal relationship between the regulations and the improved air quality. The last sentence explicitly states that this improvement would not have happened without the stricter regulations, indicating that the public outcry contributed to the regulations being put in place. This supports choice E. The passage does not provide any information that would support any of the other choices.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The statements mention that public outcries against pollution led to stricter regulations on emissions over the last few decades. As a result, the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality.
  
A: There is no information that suggests that the air quality is currently better than 30 years ago in the city with the worst air pollution.
  B: There is no information that supports the claim that no city has worse air pollution today than 30 years ago.
  C: The statements do not provide information about where most of the public outcries against pollution came from.
  D: The statements do not provide information about which cities are the most polluted today.
  E: The statements suggest that public criticism brought about stricter regulations, which led to improvements in air quality in the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The employee argues that filtering non-work-related websites is not necessarily beneficial for productivity, since other factors such as windowless rooms also cause distractions. 
A: The argument that different people react differently to substances is not similar in its reasoning since it does not address the idea that one thing can detract from another in terms of productivity.
B: The argument against banning electronic devices is not similar, since it is based on the idea that high doses may cause cancer, which is not the same as saying that one factor does not lead to increased productivity.
C: The argument that Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year is not similar in its reasoning since it does not address the potential for distractions that come from non-work-related websites blocking.
D: The argument that publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character is not similar in its reasoning, since it is based on the idea that having engaging characters does not necessarily guarantee a sale.
E: The argument that a film's success is not well-represented by profit relative to cost is not similar in its reasoning, since it does not address the idea that one thing detracts from another in terms of productivity.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
The employee argues that accessing non-work-related websites might not be any more distracting than other types of distractions that are not considered problematic. 
A: This argument criticizes the general notion of 'moderation in all things' without providing any similarity to the employee's argument. 
B: This argument criticizes the idea of banning electric devices based on one study without establishing any similarity to the employee's argument.
C: This argument makes a claim about Acme's hiring needs, but it is not similar to the employee's argument. 
D: This argument criticizes the idea of engaging characters being the only reason for publications' success while acknowledging the need for other elements too. It is not similar to the employee's argument. 
E: This argument criticizes measuring a film's financial success on profit made in comparison to the investment made, which is counterintuitive. It is not similar to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that the company's reasoning for blocking non-work-related websites (that it distracts employees from doing their best work) ignores other distractions that may exist in the office.
  A: The speaker argues against moderation, stating that what is considered moderate for one person might not be moderate for another, so moderation fails to take into account biological differences.
  B: The speaker argues against banning a particular electronic device on the grounds that many other chemicals probably cause cancer as well, but aren't banned.
  C: The speaker argues that because 1,000 employees are expected to retire over the next year, Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: The speaker argues that while engaging characters are important, publishers and agents look for a variety of elements in manuscripts.
  E: The speaker argues that judging a film's success based on profit relative to cost is misguided because it may lead to the conclusion that a more expensive movie is less successful than a lower-budget movie that sells the same number of tickets.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The employee is arguing that website filtering software blocking non-work-related websites can lead to distraction which can impact work productivity. The employee believes that similar to how offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
A: This argument points out how different people react differently to certain substances and that advocating moderation in all things would fail to take into account people's basic biological differences. This argument does not focus on distraction or productivity.
B: This argument is criticizing activists calling for an electronic device to be banned because most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses. This does not focus on distraction or productivity.
C: This argument focuses on Acme hiring approximately 1,000 people over the next year to replace retiring employees. This does not focus on distraction or productivity.
D: This argument is discussing how engaging characters in creative writing classes do not guarantee a sale since publishers and agents also consider other elements. This does not focus on distraction or productivity.
E: This argument is criticizing the movie industry's way of judging a film's success based on its profit relative to its cost. This does not focus on distraction or productivity.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only distraction in the office, hence, the company's reasoning of blocking non-work-related websites to reduce distractions is flawed.
  A: The argument is about different people's reaction to substances, which is different from the employee's argument about distractions in the office.
  B: The argument is about banning a certain electronic device due to its harmful effect on laboratory animals, which is different from the employee's argument about distractions in the office.
  C: The argument is about the number of employees retiring and the need for the company to hire new employees, which is different from the employee's argument about distractions in the office.
  D: The argument is about character focus in creative writing and its relationship to a manuscript's chances of success, which is different from the employee's argument about distractions in the office.
  E: The argument is about the criteria used in evaluating a movie's success, which is different from the employee's argument about distractions in the office.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website blocking is not necessarily effective at increasing productivity, as other distractions in the workplace may cause employees to be less productive. 
  A: The argument discusses biological differences as a reason why moderation is not an accurate guideline for consuming caffeine.
  B: The argument identifies that just because a chemical causes cancer in laboratory animals does not mean that it should be banned.
  C: The argument is about population turnover within a company and the need to hire employees to replace those who have retired.
  D: The argument discusses the idea that engaging characters do not always lead to successful publication of a novel or story. 
  E: The argument challenges the way that success in the movie industry is defined.

Knowledge:
  The employee argues that just as offices with windows or decor can be distracting, so can allowing access to non-work-related websites. The argument is based on the premise that the company's rationale for blocking such sites is flawed.
  A: The argument suggests that reliance on one-size-fits-all policy such as moderation is misguided, as it fails to take into consideration the differences in physiological responses of different individuals.
  B: The argument attempts to challenge the activists' call for a ban on the device by comparing it with a hypothetical scenario that is different in nature.
  C: The argument concludes that Acme needs to hire approximately 1,000 employees, based on the premise that around 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year.
  D: The argument challenges the idea that engaging characters guarantee a sale of novels or stories, by citing the examples where publishers and agents rejected manuscripts despite having engaging characters.
  E: The argument contends that movie industry's criterion for success, based on a film's profit relative to its cost, is misguided.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The employee's argument is that website filtering software is not an effective way to increase productivity because there are other things in the office that can be distracting, and those are not targeted by the company.
  A: This argument is saying that moderation is not a good guideline because different people react differently to substances, and thus moderation for one person cannot be recommended to another.
  B: This argument is saying that banning a device because it causes cancer in animals is not a good idea because most chemicals can cause cancer in high doses and we don't ban all of them.
  C: This argument is saying that because Acme has a certain number of retirees, they will need to hire an equal number of people to keep the workforce the same size.
  D: This argument is saying that while engaging characters are important in novels and stories, they do not guarantee a sale and other elements must be considered as well.
  E: This argument is saying that judging a movie's success based on the ratio of its profit to its cost is misguided and can lead to counter-intuitive results.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The problem involves an explanation for why the nicotine levels in smokers' blood seem to be independent of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. 
A: If this statement were true, it would limit how much nicotine could be absorbed, which could explain why nicotine levels don't vary. However, it is not clear that this statement is true.
B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument and does not help explain why nicotine levels do not vary.
C: This statement is directly related to the argument and helps explain why nicotine levels do not vary. If most nicotine is absorbed into the bloodstream regardless of how much is delivered in a single cigarette, then it makes sense that the levels of nicotine in smokers' blood would be the same regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
D: This statement does not help to explain why nicotine levels do not vary. It discusses tar levels, not nicotine levels.
E: This statement does not help to explain why nicotine levels do not vary. It discusses what happens to nicotine levels after smoking ceases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  A recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  A: This statement, if true, would limit the maximum amount of nicotine that can be absorbed into blood, but it doesn't explain why low or high nicotine cigarettes result in the same amount of nicotine in the blood of a smoker.
  B: This statement, if true, could explain why low-nicotine cigarettes result in the same amount of nicotine as high-nicotine cigarettes when smoked. 
  C: This statement, if true, could help to explain why the level of nicotine found in the blood of smokers at the end of a day's worth of smoking is not proportional to the nicotine level per cigarette. 
  D: This statement focuses on tar levels, which are not relevant to the study's findings about nicotine levels in the blood. 
  E: This statement is not relevant to the study's findings about nicotine levels in the blood. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The context explains that a recent study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Choices:
  A: This statement suggests a physical limitation on nicotine absorption but doesn't directly explain the findings of the study.
  B: This statement suggests an alternative explanation for the nicotine study findings, but it contradicts the assumption stated in the question that smokers of one pack of cigarettes per day were studied, regardless of the nicotine level.
  C: This statement suggests that the amount of nicotine delivered does not affect the degree of absorption by the body and helps justify the study findings. 
  D: This statement addresses the level of tar in cigarettes, which is not directly related to nicotine absorption or the findings of the study. 
  E: This statement provides information on how quickly nicotine leaves the blood once smoking is discontinued, but it doesn't relate directly to the findings of the study.

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  A: This choice addresses the amount of nicotine that the blood can absorb, but it does not explain why the levels of nicotine in the blood are the same regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarette smoked.
  B: This choice provides a plausible explanation. If smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes smoke more cigarettes to obtain the same amount of nicotine, then perhaps they end up with as much nicotine in their blood as smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes who smoke fewer cigarettes.
  C: This choice provides an explanation as to why the amount of nicotine in the blood at the end of a day's worth of smoking is the same regardless of the nicotine content of the cigarette smoked.
  D: This choice makes a statement about tar and does not explain why nicotine levels are the same regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarette smoked.
  E: This choice implies that the study results may be caused by a steady decrease in nicotine, but it does not explain how nicotine levels are the same regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarette smoked.

  Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. 
  The levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  
A: Blood absorption of nicotine is relative to nicotine levels in cigarettes, and not limited to a specific amount.
B: Smokers of lower-nicotine cigarettes tend to smoke more cigarettes to attain the desired nicotine, which does not explain the identical nicotine levels found in the blood after smoking a day's worth of cigarettes.
C: If the majority of nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even when it comes in smaller quantities, it would help explain the identical nicotine levels found in the blood after smoking one day's worth of cigarettes.
D: The level of tar in cigarettes, whether low or high-nicotine, does not necessarily explain why nicotine absorption is identical among smokers after smoking one day's worth of cigarettes.
E: Although the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily after discontinuation, this does not explain the identical level of nicotine found in the blood at the end of a day's worth of smoking regardless of the nicotine potency of the cigarette.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The author's argument is that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information because of their accuracy in determining copper concentrations. 
A: This statement neither strengthens nor weakens the argument.
B: This statement implies that the researcher's findings could be replicated in locations where copper particles are a component of air pollution, which would strengthen the argument.
C: This statement neither strengthens nor weakens the argument as it does not relate to the effectiveness of lichens in determining copper concentrations.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because the argument is about the accuracy of lichens in measuring copper concentrations, not about the ease of growing lichens in laboratories.
E: This statement implies that lichens can be used to measure other air pollutants beyond copper, which would strengthen the argument. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The researcher has found that lichens are as accurate as the best equipment for monitoring airborne copper pollution as a cheaper way to monitor air quality.
A: This statement is stating that mechanical monitoring devices have not been installed at serious air pollution sites, which does not have any impact on the researcher's argument that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices.
B: This statement highlights that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several places; it strengthens the researcher's argument by providing evidence that lichens could be used to monitor air pollution beyond just the specific site that was tested in the researcher's study.
C: This statement conflicts with the researcher's study findings that lichens were effective in absorbing airborne pollutants and useful for monitoring air quality.
D: While laboratory-grown lichens may be useful for conducting further research, it does not necessarily strengthen the researcher's argument that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
E: This statement undercuts the researcher's argument by stating that lichens do not absorb all other significant air pollutants in the same way they absorb copper.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The researcher asserts that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices effectively. The researcher has harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were found to be as accurate as the best equipment available.

A: This statement does not relate to the assertion made by the researcher or the argument made in the passage.
B: This statement indicates that copper particles are present in several locales in air pollution, which strengthens the argument made by the researcher.
C: This statement if true, does not support the researcher's conclusion that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices effectively.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the assertion made by the researcher in the passage.
E: This statement does not relate to the other pollutants. The passage does not provide any evidence to support or refute the given statement.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The researcher argues that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information since lichens had the same accuracy as the best equipment available in monitoring copper pollution.
A: This statement does not provide any additional information to support the researcher's argument. 
B: This is relevant information which supports the researcher's argument that lichens are a cheaper means of monitoring pollution since they can detect copper particles, a common component of air pollution. 
C: This information does not support the researcher's argument as lichens were harvested from sites with airborne copper pollution, not areas of minimal pollution. 
D: This does not support the researcher's argument as the argument is that lichens harvested from polluted sites are a cheaper replacement for expensive devices. Growing lichens in the laboratory would not be a cheaper option compared to using expensive air pollution-monitoring devices. 
E: This is relevant information that supports the researcher's argument that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without a loss of information, as it suggests that lichens absorb other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The researcher argues that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information by providing accurate readings of air pollution, including copper pollution.
A: This statement does not provide any information that supports the argument of the researcher.
B: This statement provides supporting evidence that copper pollution is a component of air pollution in several locales. If an air monitoring equipment can accurately detect airborne copper particles, then lichens can be an alternative that is as accurate as the best equipment available for detecting copper concentration.
C: This statement provides irrelevant information about lichens. It has no effect on the accuracy of copper monitoring by using lichens to replace air monitoring equipment.
D: This statement does not provide any information that supports the argument of the researcher.
E: This statement provides evidence that lichens absorb significant air pollutants, similar to copper particles, which suggests that lichens may be an effective alternative to expensive air monitoring equipment for detecting a wide range of pollutants.

Response 5:
Knowledge: The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace mechanical monitoring devices without loss of information in monitoring air quality as lichens are as accurate as the best equipment available.
A: This statement does not add any new information that strengthens the researcher's argument. 
B: This statement supports the researcher's argument that copper is a component of air pollution and lichens can absorb copper, making them effective for monitoring air quality.
C: This statement weakens the researcher's argument as the goal is to monitor air pollution in areas plagued by airborne pollutants and areas with minimal air pollution are not of interest.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the researcher's argument as the researcher is comparing the accuracy of lichens to mechanical monitoring devices and not discussing their growth.
E: This statement weakens the researcher's argument as it implies that lichens can't replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices since they only absorb copper and not other significant air pollutants. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The researcher claims that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information, and that the lichens he tested were as accurate as the best equipment available.
 
A: This fact is not relevant to the researcher's argument, which is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring equipment.
  B: This information provides support to the researcher's claim. If copper particles are present in areas with air pollution, then using lichens to measure the copper concentration in those areas can be an effective way to monitor air quality and indirectly measure other pollutants as well.
  C: This information weakens the researcher's argument. If lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal, then they may not be useful for detecting and monitoring pollution in more heavily polluted areas.
  D: This fact may be interesting, but it does not address whether lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring equipment.
  E: This information is not relevant to the researcher's claim, which is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring equipment without loss of information.

  C: This fact provides information about the growth of lichens in areas where air pollution is minimal and does not strengthen the researcher's argument.
  D: This fact has no relevance in the researcher's argument.
  E: This fact suggests that lichens are effective at absorbing significant air pollutants beyond copper, which strengthens the researcher's argument that lichens are a useful replacement for expensive pollution-monitoring devices.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
   The researcher used lichens to determine air pollution in areas plagued by airborne copper pollution. The study found that the lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. This suggests that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  
  A: This statement is outside the scope of the argument and irrelevant to the finding. It does not strengthen the researcher's argument. 
  B: This statement is mildly interesting, but it doesn't strengthen the researcher's argument that lichens are an effective and economical alternative to mechanical monitoring devices.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument since the researcher is investigating the use of lichens in polluted areas and not in areas with minimal air pollution. This doesn't strengthen the researcher's argument.
  D: This statement neither supports nor weakens the researcher's argument, as the argument is about the accuracy of lichens for monitoring air pollutants, and not about the ease of growing lichens in laboratories.
  E: This statement strengthens the researcher's argument by suggesting that lichens absorb all significant air pollutants in a similar way as they absorb copper. This supports the idea that lichens can be used as a cheaper yet accurate alternative to expensive pollution-monitoring devices.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute
  E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it. The distinction is made between lying and withholding relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information and the example used is that lying actively encourages a false belief, while withholding information only fails to prevent a false belief.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding information in interviews by offering an example of a clear instance of the distinction. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle (lying is unethical) by comparing a case in which it applies (saying something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener) to one in which it does not apply (withholding relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information). Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The journalist is defending the practice of withholding relevant information as distinct from lying, in order to show that this practice is not unethical. The argument is based on a comparison between the two practices and an effort to show that the distinction between them is justified. The journalist's defense of withholding information is considered controversial by some, and therefore the journalist offers an example of a clear instance of the distinction in order to clarify it. Thus, the correct option is B.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding information by providing an example that illustrates this distinction, which makes choice B the best option. Choice A is incorrect because the journalist does not argue that the cases being compared are different. Choice C is incorrect because the journalist does not attempt to apply a definition to the cases being discussed, rather he is focusing on the distinctions between them. Choice D is incorrect because the journalist does not appeal to a counterexample, but rather makes a distinction between lying and withholding information. Choice E is also incorrect because the journalist is not comparing to cases where a moral principle applies, and neither is he clarifying a moral principle.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding relevant information by offering an example of how the two actions are different and why lying is unethical. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist is defending the distinction between lying and withholding relevant information by offering an example of what the journalist considers a clear instance of it. The example is that while lying actively encourages a false belief, withholding relevant information only fails to prevent a false belief. So, the journalist is arguing on the basis of the distinction between the two concepts. So, the answer is B.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

The journalist defends what they consider to be a controversial distinction, the distinction between lying and withholding information during an interview, by offering an example that supports their argument. The example is that lying is actively encouraging a false belief, while withholding information simply fails to prevent a false belief.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply. Specifically, the journalist is arguing that withholding information in interviews is not equivalent to lying and is therefore not unethical. The argument involves distinguishing between actively encouraging a false belief (which is unethical) and failing to prevent a false belief (which is not necessarily unethical).
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is making a comparison between two cases that on the surface seem similar, but have a relevant moral difference. The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle (lying is unethical) by comparing a case in which it applies (saying something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener) to one in which it does not apply (withholding information in an interview to elicit new information). Therefore, the correct answer is E.

Context: Mario: I see that the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business. Evidently there's little demand for rugs in Glendale. So if you're planning to open a new business there, rugs would be one product to avoid. Renate: It's true that the store is gone, but its closing had little to do with the product it sold. All this means is that the
Question: The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: the rug store in Glendale sold rugs of inferior quality
  B: it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale
  C: it is possible to determine the market for rugs in Glendale
  D: any other stores have gone out of business in Glendale
  E: rug stores can close because of insufficient demand for rugs
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
  Mario suggests that opening a new business that specializes in rugs might not be a good idea because of the little demand there is for rugs in Glendale. 
  Renate counters that the closing of the only rug store in Glendale had little to do with the product it sold. 

Answer Explanation:
  The dialogue presents a disagreement between Mario and Renate about whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Mario argues that it would be a bad choice due to the lack of demand for rugs. Renate, however, argues that the closure of the rug store had little to do with the demand for rugs, suggesting that opening a rug store could potentially be a good idea. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
  Mario argues that one should avoid selling rugs in Glendale due to a lack of demand. 
  Renate refutes this by claiming that the rug store's closing had nothing to do with the product it sold, implying that the lack of demand for rugs was not the main issue. 

Answer:
The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Mario suggests that it would be unwise to open a new business selling rugs in Glendale because of the store's closure and the supposed lack of demand for rugs in the area. Renate disagrees, pointing out that the store's closure was not due to lack of demand for rugs. Their disagreement centers around the wisdom of opening a new rug store in Glendale, hence the answer is B. The other answer choices are not relevant to their disagreement.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Mario suggests that the closure of the rug store indicates that rugs are not in high demand, and that consequently Renate should avoid opening a rug store in Glendale. Renate disagrees, and points out that the closure of the store had little to do with the product it sold. Neither Mario nor Renate discuss the quality of the rugs sold, the closure of other stores, or the possibility of determining the market for rugs in Glendale. The dialogue is primarily concerned with whether or not it would be a good idea to open a rug store in the area. Therefore, the best answer is (B): whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Mario suggests that the only rug store in Glendale went out of business because of insufficient demand for rugs, so it would be wise to avoid opening a rug store there. On the other hand, Renate disagrees with Mario's conclusion and suggests that the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold. Therefore, the dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. So, option B is the correct answer.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
Mario's statement is that the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business because of insufficient demand for rugs, so a new business should avoid selling rugs in Glendale.
In Renate's response, she disagrees about the cause of the rug store's closing, but she does not offer any opinion on opening a new rug store in Glendale.

Answer Explanation:
Renate does not offer any comment about whether opening a rug store in Glendale is a good idea, so the two persons are disagreeing about this point.

Therefore, the best answer is B: it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Mario claims that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale, so a new business should avoid selling rugs. Renate disagrees and argues that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold. These differences imply that they have different opinions on whether opening a rug store is a good idea for Glendale, so the correct answer is B. 

Option A is not mentioned in the dialogue.
Option C is not explicitly mentioned in the dialogue and is not the main point of disagreement.
Option D is not relevant to the discussion.
Option E summarizes Mario's view and is not the point of disagreement.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The dialogue is focused on whether or not rugs would be a good product to sell in the only rug store in Glendale, which has gone out of business. Mario suggests that because the rug store went out of business, it must mean there is little demand for rugs in Glendale, and therefore opening a new store selling rugs would not be a good idea. Renate disagrees and suggests that the closing of the rug store had little to do with the product they sold, indicating that a new rug store could still have a viable market in Glendale.  Thus, the disagreement is related to whether or not opening a rug store in Glendale would be a good idea. Therefore, the correct answer is B. None of the other choices reflect the main point of the disagreement.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
Mario suggests that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale. Therefore, he believes that opening a rug store there is not a good idea. On the other hand, Renate argues that the closed store's product had little to do with its closing. Therefore, Renate thinks that the store's failure is not an indicator that a new rug store would fail in Glendale. The disagreement between Mario and Renate is whether it is or not a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale, so the best answer choice is B: it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge: 
  Mario suggests avoiding rugs as a product for a new business in Glendale due to little demand, based on the closure of the only rug store in town.
  Renate disagrees and believes the closure of the rug store had little to do with the product it sold.
  
Answer Explanation: 
  Mario and Renate are discussing the feasibility of selling rugs in Glendale. Mario suggests that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale, citing the recent closing of the only rug store in town. Renate disagrees that the closure of the rug store was related to demand for the product it sold, but does not provide an alternative reason for its closure. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that Mario and Renate disagree over whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale. Therefore, the answer is B.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response, because it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers.

A: This statement provides no information that is relevant to the argument about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal or not.
B: This statement provides no information that is relevant to the argument about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal or not.
C: This statement challenges the argument's premise that commensals benefit human beings.
D: This statement provides no information that is relevant to the argument about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal or not.
E: This statement provides no information that is relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing the status of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori as a commensal.
  The argument is using the fact that only a small percentage of individuals get sick from Mycobacter tuberculosis to argue against considering H. pylori a commensal.
A: This answer choice presents information about the treatment of the diseases caused by H. pylori and M. tuberculosis, but it doesn't relate to or have an impact on the argument's reasoning.
B: This answer choice provides information about the duration of the diseases caused by H. pylori and M. tuberculosis, but it doesn't relate to or have an impact on the argument's reasoning.
C: If true, this answer choice supports the argument's reasoning by showing that M. tuberculosis does not provide any benefits to the body and therefore cannot be considered a commensal. This is not undermining the argument.
D: This answer choice does not relate to or have an impact on the argument's reasoning about whether or not H. pylori is a commensal.
E: If true, this answer choice undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that the prevalence of H. pylori might be a reason for considering it a commensal, as simply more people have the bacteria in their body.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument states that H pylori cannot be a commensal despite being present in many people without causing any harm because it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. It argues that since only 10% of people who harbor M tuberculosis gets sick from it, the fact that H pylori allegedly strengthens immune response cannot make it a commensal. 
A: This statement has no relevance to the argument. 
B: This statement has no relevance to the argument.
C: If true, this statement would support the argument because it highlights that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, making the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis not relevant. 
D: This doesn't weaken the argument as the total number of people doesn't change the fact that M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal.
E: If true, this statement would undermine the argument because it could suggest that H pylori might be considered a commensal due to the higher number of people who harbor it compared to the number of people who have M tuberculosis. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The passage argues against the idea of considering H pylori as a commensal based on the fact that it causes stomach ulcers. The comparison is made with M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal despite the fact that only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick from it.

A: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as it talks about treatment options for each disease.
B: The duration of each disease is not relevant to the argument.
C: This statement strengthens the argument further, as it provides evidence that people derive no benefit from harboring M tuberculosis.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
E: This statement undermines the argument, as it provides a difference between the number of people who harbor H pylori and the number of people who harbor M tuberculosis, making the comparison less relevant.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal even if it allegedly strengthens the immune response because it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample since only about 10 % of people who harbor this bacterium get sick from it. 
A: This statement does not directly relate to the argument that H pylori should or should not be considered a commensal.
B: This statement is about the duration of diseases caused by H pylori and M tuberculosis. It is irrelevant to the argument that H pylori should or should not be considered a commensal.
C: This statement is a counterexample to the argument that H pylori should be considered a commensal, since it shows that not all bacteria with a low incidence of sickness can be considered commensals. However, it does not undermine the argument's reasoning directly.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument that H pylori should or should not be considered a commensal.
E: If there are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis, then it strengthens the argument's reasoning that H pylori should not be considered a commensal since it causes stomach ulcers as well as allegedly strengthening the immune response. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument points out that some scientists consider H pylori a commensal, but the author disagrees. The argument also draws a comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis to further support the idea that H pylori should not be considered a commensal. 

A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
B: This choice is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: This choice explains that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which supports the overall argument's reasoning that M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal. 
D: The number of people who harbor these bacteria is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
E: This choice is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the fact that only a small portion of people who harbor H pylori develop stomach ulcers does not make it a commensal, while a small portion of people who harbor M tuberculosis don't get sick from it, yet it is not a commensal either.
  A: This statement does not relate to the argument concerning if bacteria should be considered commensals or not.
  B: This statement does not relate to the argument concerning if bacteria should be considered commensals or not.
  C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the mere absence of benefits from a bacterium is not enough to determine if it is a commensal or not.
  D: This statement does not relate to the argument concerning if bacteria should be considered commensals or not.
  E: This statement does not relate to the argument concerning if bacteria should be considered commensals or not.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument is trying to dispute the claim that Helicobacter pylori is a commensal bacterium even though it causes stomach ulcers. It compares the situation with Mycobacter tuberculosis which can also cause a disease but is not considered a commensal because only some people get sick from it. It concludes that this reasoning is misguided.
A: This choice does not provide information that undermines the argument's reasoning.
B: This choice provides information about the duration of the diseases and is irrelevant to the argument.
C: This choice provides the necessary information to counter argue that M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal. If M tuberculosis does not provide benefits to human beings who harbor it, it would make sense not to see it as a commensal.
D: This choice is irrelevant to the argument as it does not provide any useful insights as to why M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal.
E: This choice is also irrelevant because it does not provide any evidence to the argument.
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 8:
Knowledge: The argument claims that considering H pylori a commensal is misguided because it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response. The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counter-example because only about 10% of the people who harbor it get sick from it, yet it is not considered a commensal. 
A: This fact is not relevant since the point of the argument is to distinguish between commensals and non-commensals, not to compare treatment options. 
B: This fact is not relevant to the argument about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal or not.
C: This fact does not weaken the argument, but rather supports it by providing another example of a non-commensal bacterium with majority harmful effects.
D: This fact is not relevant to the argument about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal or not.
E: This fact does not undermine the argument's reasoning because it is consistent with the argument's claim that H pylori is not a commensal. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite allegedly strengthening immune response because it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers and not everyone who has it gets sick.
- The argument compares this with M tuberculosis, which is not a commensal, and claims that even though not everyone who harbors it gets sick, no one would call it a commensal.

A: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning and is not relevant to the discussion of whether H pylori can be considered a commensal or not.
B: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning about H pylori and its status as a commensal, and is also not true since the duration of tuberculosis can vary widely.
C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning that M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal, but it does not undermine the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis that the argument is making.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning about the commensal status of H pylori and M tuberculosis.
E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning by pointing out that there are more people who harbor H pylori, which weakens the argument's comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis. If proportionally the same number of people get sick from both bacteria, then the fact that more people harbor H pylori means the argument's comparison is less meaningful.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The naturalist claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances since they have the ability to find their way.
A: The fact that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times does not necessarily invalidate the ability of polar bears to navigate considerable distances, especially if this is a common navigation behavior among polar bears.
B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route that means that the bear could have used other cues rather than navigation to find its way home, which casts doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
C: The fact that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice does not necessarily invalidate the ability of polar bears to navigate considerable distances, especially if this is a common navigation behavior among polar bears.
D: The fact that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances is not relevant to the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate considerable distances.
E: The fact that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory is not relevant to the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate considerable distances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The naturalists' claim is about the ability of polar bears to navigate over considerable distances.
  A: This statement suggests that the polar bear may not have been navigating based on mental maps or sensory inputs, but rather through trial and error.
  B: This statement does not necessarily weaken the naturalists' claim since polar bears could have navigated using multiple routes or used a different reference point.
  C: This statement does not necessarily weaken the naturalists' claim since the fact that the route consisted primarily of snow and ice doesn't preclude the polar bear from using other cues to navigate.
  D: This statement has no impact on the validity of the evidence offered by the naturalist's claim. 
  E: This statement supports the naturalists' claim since it suggests that polar bears have a unique ability to navigate using their sense of smell.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses evidence that is cited in support of naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  A: The fact that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory does not necessarily undermine the idea that the polar bear could navigate over a considerable distance.
  B: If it could be shown that the released polar bear was already on its annual migration route when it was released, then this would suggest that the bear finding its way back home does not necessarily imply that it has the ability to navigate over an unfamiliar territory.
  C: The fact that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, suggests that the polar bear must have some navigation ability to be able to find its way back home.
  D: The fact that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, is irrelevant to the validity of the evidence presented in support of naturalists' claim.
  E: The fact that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, does not necessarily negate the possibility that polar bears also have the ability to navigate over unfamiliar terrain. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The question is asking about evidence that supports the naturalists' claim that Polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. 
  The evidence offered is an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We are looking for an option that cast doubt on the validity of this evidence. 
  A: The fact that the bear stopped and changed course several times doesn't necessarily invalidate the evidence.
  B: If the location where the bear was released was on the annual migration route of the bear then it could cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  C: The fact that the bear traveled primarily on snow and drifting ice doesn't necessarily invalidate the evidence.
  D: While this statement suggests that Polar bears are not the only animals with the ability to find their way back home, it does not invalidate the evidence.
  E: The statement provides additional information about the polar bear's sensitivity to smell, but doesn't necessarily invalidate the evidence.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The evidence supporting naturalists' claim about polar bears' navigation ability is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: If the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, it would weaken the evidence that the polar bear used navigation to find its way back home.
  B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it would support the evidence that the polar bear used navigation to find its way back home.
  C: If the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, it would not affect the validity of the evidence offered in support of naturalists' claim.
  D: If polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, it would not affect the validity of the evidence offered in support of naturalists' claim.
  E: If polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, it would not affect the validity of the evidence offered in support of naturalists' claim.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The evidence in support of naturalists' claim is an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: It doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence in support of the naturalists' claim.
  B: The fact that the site of release was on the bear's annual migration route, if anything, supports the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  C: The fact that the polar bear traveled primarily on snow and drifting ice doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence in support of the naturalists' claim.
  D: The fact that other species of mammals have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence in support of the naturalists' claim.
  E: The polar bear's sensory abilities do not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence in support of the naturalists' claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The question asks which statement would cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence refers to an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: This statement gives information about the bear's movements, but does not directly contradict the naturalists' claim. 
  B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, then it could suggest that the bear navigated home by following its familiar migration route rather than using some innate navigational skills.
  C: This statement describes the route taken by the bear, but does not directly contradict the naturalists' claim.
  D: This statement tells us that polar bears are not the only species that exhibit this behavior, but it does not cast doubt on the specific evidence presented in support of the naturalists' claim.
  E: This statement describes one of the ways in which polar bears navigate, but it does not directly contradict the naturalists' claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances and they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: The fact that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the claim, as it could be explained as the bear trying to find the safest and most efficient route.
  B: The fact that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the claim, as this could be an indication that the bear was familiar with the general area.
  C: The fact that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the claim, as polar bears are adapted to live in such conditions and may have developed navigation skills that are specific to their habitat.
  D: The fact that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances may weaken the uniqueness of polar bears' navigation skills, but it does not directly cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered by the naturalists.
  E: The fact that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory is not relevant to the validity of the evidence offered by the naturalists.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. 
  Evidence cited for this claim is about a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being release over 500 km away. 
  A: The fact that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times may actually corroborate the naturalists' claim.
  B: The fact that the polar bear was released on its annual migration route supports the idea that the polar bear has a strong sense of direction.
  C: The fact that the route primarily consisted of snow and ice is not relevant to the validity of the evidence cited in support of the claim.
  D: The fact that other species of mammal have also found their way home from considerable distances does not invalidate the evidence cited in support of the claim.
  E: The fact that polar bears rely on their sense of smell in order to scent out familiar territory is not relevant to the validity of the evidence cited in support of the claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the polar bear's ability to return after being released 500 km away is evidence that they can navigate over considerable distances.
  A: The fact that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times does not directly challenge the validity of the evidence presented, as the animal may still have utilized a long-range sense of navigation to find its way back to its home.
  B: The fact that the release site was on the bear's annual migration route would make the success of the bear's return more likely, and therefore support the naturalists' claim.
  C: The fact that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice is a neutral piece of information that does not directly impact the validity of the evidence presented.
  D: The fact that other species of mammals have been known to find their way home from considerable distances does not directly challenge the validity of the evidence presented with respect to polar bears.
  E: The fact that polar bears rely on their sense of smell to scent out familiar territory is also a neutral piece of information that does not directly impact the validity of the evidence presented.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  It cites studies that show Western countries have higher colon cancer rates than non-Western countries with higher fiber-rich foods.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
B: This choice is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: This choice is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
D: The argument does not address or distinguish between different types of fiber in fruits/vegetables and cereals.
E: This choice provides a potential alternative explanation for why countries with high fiber consumption may have lower colon cancer rates, which conflicts with the argument's explanation.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-father diets and colon cancer, that the consumption of fther prevents colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther is necessary. The argument doesn't address other possible causes or factors.
A: The argument doesn't say that fther consumption is decreasing or increasing. Hence, it's not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument discusses the relationship between fther and colon cancer, not the relationship between fther and other types of cancers.
C: The argument doesn't address this possibility; hence, it's not relevant to the argument.
D: The argument doesn't mention that different fther-rich foods have varying degrees of cancer-fighting properties. Hence, it's not relevant to the argument.
E: This is a possible criticism since the argument doesn't acknowledge that some foods with fther also have other substances that could prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that consuming fiber prevents colon cancer and insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer. 
  The argument supports its claim by referring to studies showing negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rate. 
  The argument mentions that people in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods have lower colon cancer rates.
  The argument mentions that in Scandinavia, higher colon cancer rate is associated with lower consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
Choices:
  A: The argument's conclusion relies on the negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rate. Therefore, whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning. This choice is not the answer. 
  B: The argument neither mentions nor implies that the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fiber diets. This choice is not the answer.
  C: Whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets doesn't affect the argument's reasoning that fiber deficiency causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. This choice is not the answer.
  D: The argument claims that cereals, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fiber and their consumption is associated with lower colon cancer rates. The argument supports its claim by implying that fiber in different foods has the same effect of preventing colon cancer.  Therefore, the argument cannot be criticized for overlooking the possibility that the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees. This choice is not the answer. 
  E: This choice suggests that foods containing fiber also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer. The argument doesn't address this possibility or attempt to rule it out. This choice could be a valid criticism of the argument's reasoning.   
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer, and that lack of fiber causes it. It provides supporting evidence based on colon cancer rates in various regions of the world and the correlation to fiber intake.
  A: The argument is focused on the relationship between fiber intake and colon cancer rates, and does not consider the trend in fiber consumption.
  B: This option introduces a new idea that is not related to the argument's focus on fiber and colon cancer.
  C: While this option may be true, it does not undermine the argument's main claim that lack of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient intake of fiber prevents it.
  D: This option introduces a distinction between the type of fiber in fruits and vegetables and cereals, which is beyond the scope of the argument's focus on fiber in general and its relationship to colon cancer.
  E: This option is potentially relevant to the argument, as it suggests that other substances in fiber-rich foods may also contribute to preventing colon cancer, and not just the fiber itself.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is claiming that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, while sufficient consumption of fther prevents it. It provides evidence from numerous studies that show a negative correlation between fther-rich diets and colon cancer incidence.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument and does not challenge its reasoning.
  B: This statement, which is about the risk of other types of cancer, is not relevant to the argument and does not challenge its reasoning.
  C: While this statement suggests that some people may find it difficult to include fther in their diets, it does not challenge the argument's reasoning that fther prevents colon cancer. Additionally, the argument provides evidence that people in non-Western countries, where fther-rich foods are more prominent, have lower colon cancer rates.
  D: This statement is not mentioned in the argument, and it does not challenge the argument's reasoning that fther prevents colon cancer. Rather, the argument shows that there is a negative correlation between the consumption of fther-rich cereals, fruits, and vegetables and colon cancer rates.
  E: This statement challenges the argument's reasoning. It raises the possibility that the positive effects of fther consumption on colon cancer rates could be offset by other substances in fther-rich foods. If other substances in fther-containing foods tend to prevent colon cancer, that would weaken the argument's claim that fther alone is responsible for preventing colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims there is a pronounced negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. 
  The colon cancer rate in Western countries is higher than in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  There's a relationship between the consumption of cereals (high in fiber) and colon cancer rate in Scandinavia.
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, while sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: This choice does not affect the conclusion of the argument because the argument is looking at the relationship between fther consumption and colon cancer, not whether fther consumption is increasing in various countries. So, this choice is not the answer.
B: This choice does not affect the conclusion of the argument, nor does it address the relationship between fther consumption and colon cancer. Therefore, this choice is not the answer.
C: This choice may weaken the argument, but it is not a significant reason to undermine the general conclusion. The argument still claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and the solution to preventing colon cancer is sufficient consumption of fiber. So, this choice is not the answer.
D: This choice does not affect the conclusion of the argument because the argument only focuses on the general relationship between fther consumption and colon cancer. Therefore, this choice is not the answer.
E: This choice is the best answer because it undermines the argument. If it is true that the foods containing fther also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer, then the argument's conclusion that the sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer would be problematic. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer. It gives examples from different countries to support this claim. The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
  A: The fact that the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably is not relevant to the argument's claim that fiber is correlated with lower colon cancer rates.
  B: The argument's focus is specifically on the relationship between fiber and colon cancer. Whether high-fiber diets are associated with a reduced risk of other types of cancer is not relevant to this argument.
  C: The argument does not address whether fiber may be difficult for people to include in their diets.
  D: While this choice addresses the issue of whether different types of high-fiber foods are equally effective in preventing colon cancer, it does not contradict the argument's central claim about the correlation between high fiber diets and lower colon cancer rates.
  E: This choice argues that other substances in foods containing fiber may also prevent colon cancer in addition to fiber, which undermines the argument's simple causal claim that high fiber intake prevents colon cancer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, while sufficient consumption of fther prevents it based on the negative correlation between high-fther diets and colon cancer rates. However, the argument may be vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks other possible reasons why fther may or may not be related to colon cancer.

A: This statement is not relevant to the argument. Whether the consumption of fther is rising or falling has no bearing on whether fther prevents or causes colon cancer.

B: This statement is not relevant to the argument because it doesn't challenge whether insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, or whether sufficient consumption of fther prevents it. The argument only discusses the relationship between fther and colon cancer.

C: This statement may be relevant to the argument if it is challenging the idea that consuming enough fther can prevent colon cancer. However, the argument does not assert that everyone can include fther in their diets or that eating fther is easy for everyone. Rather, it argues that people who eat more fther-rich foods have lower rates of colon cancer than those who don't.

D: This statement could be relevant to the argument because it challenges the idea that fther alone is responsible for preventing colon cancer. However, the argument does not specify the degree to which different types of fther can prevent colon cancer, so it is not immediately clear that this is a vulnerability in the argument's reasoning.

E: This statement could be relevant to the argument because it challenges the idea that fther alone is responsible for preventing colon cancer. Perhaps other substances in fther-rich foods are helping to prevent the cancer, rather than just the fther itself.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer, and that the lower the consumption of fiber in a given area, the higher the colon cancer rate; therefore, it concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably or not is not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument is focused on the relationship between fiber and colon cancer, it does not make any claim about the effects of high-fiber diets on other types of cancer.
C: The argument does not address the difficulty of including fiber in people's diets; it merely claims that the lack of fiber causes colon cancer.
D: The argument does not compare the cancer-fighting properties of fiber in different foods; it only emphasizes the importance of consuming enough fiber to prevent colon cancer.
E: This is a plausible alternative explanation that could undermine the argument.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
A: Whether the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably is irrelevant to the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  
B: Whether the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fiber diets is irrelevant to the argument's claim that fiber prevents colon cancer.
  
C: Whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets is irrelevant to the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

D: Whether the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees is irrelevant to the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.

E: Whether foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer is relevant to the argument. If, for example, a high-fiber diet is effective not because of fiber itself but because of other substances in foods containing fiber, then the argument's claim that insufficient fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient fiber prevents it, might be false.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known
  E: takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document which listed hundreds of manufacturing companies affiliated with the trade group.
  The representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not included in the document, which suggests that it is not a member of the trade group.
  A: This is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This is a possible flaw as there could be additional members that are not listed in the document inadvertently sent to the journalist.
  C: This is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: This is irrelevant to the argument.
  E: This is a possible flaw since the statement from the representative might not be accurate.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document that inadvertently listed hundreds of companies in a manufacturers' trade group and the representative confirmed that every company in the document is indeed a member of the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, the journalist concludes that it is not a member of the group. However, it is possible that the list is incomplete or that Bruch Industries' membership status was simply not included in the document. Thus, the journalist's reasoning is flawed.
  
A: This answer choice is not addressing the flaw in the journalist's reasoning.
B: This answer choice correctly identifies the flaw in the journalist's argument. The journalist cannot conclude that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group based on the absence of its name on the document since the document might not list every member of the group.
C: This answer choice is not addressing the flaw in the journalist's reasoning.
D: This answer choice is not addressing the flaw in the journalist's reasoning.
E: This answer choice is not addressing the flaw in the journalist's reasoning.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies, which was inadvertently sent to the journalist. The trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document does belong to the trade group. The journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group as it is not listed in the document.
A: The journalist's argument is not flawed because the journalist does not mention whether or not Bruch Industries wants to belong to the trade group.
B: The journalist's argument is not flawed. The journalist presented evidence that the document included hundreds of manufacturing companies and the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document does belong to the trade group.
C: The journalist's argument is not flawed because the cause of how the document was inadvertently sent out is irrelevant to the journalist's conclusion.
D: The journalist's argument is not flawed because the journalist does not have to provide a reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known to prove that it is not a member.
E: The journalist's argument is flawed in that the journalist takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies that belong to a trade group, and he has evidence that every company listed in the document belong to the trade group. 
  The journalist infers that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group because it is not listed on the document he received.
  A: The journalist doesn't need to present any reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group; this fact is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: The journalist says that the representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. Therefore, the journalist took steps to confirm that the document named every member of the trade group.
  C: While this statement may raise concerns about the trade group's security practices, it does not affect the journalist's argument that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group.
  D: The journalist only needs to show that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group and does not need to present reasons why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known.
  E: The statement by the trade group's representative is one of the pieces of evidence that the journalist uses to support the argument; however, the argument does not rely only on this evidence, as the journalist has also examined the document containing the names of the trade group's member companies.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
The argument is about the journalist's flawed reasoning.
The journalist received a document listing manufacturing companies belonging to a trade group whose membership list is secret. The trade group representative confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the group. Since Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, the journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group.

A: The argument does not concern Bruch Industries' motivation for joining the trade group, but rather whether or not it is a member.
B: The argument has a premise that the document bears the names of every manufacturing company belonging to the group, so this choice is incorrect.
C: This choice tries to attack the argument by pointing out a side issue, and as such, it is incorrect.
D: This choice is also out of topic because the argument is not based on Bruch's wish of becoming known as a group member or not. 
E: This choice is correct because it questions the accuracy of the premise that every company that belongs to the trade group is listed in the document. It questions whether the representative was correct in stating that every member was listed.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The journalist has obtained a document that lists the members of a manufacturers' trade group, and Bruch Industries is not listed on the document. 
  The trade group has confirmed that every company listed in the document is a member of the trade group.
  
A: This is irrelevant; whether or not Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group does not affect the argument.
B: This is a relevant flaw in the journalist's reasoning. Just because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it does not necessarily follow that it is not a member of the trade group, as the document may not list every member of the group.
C: This is irrelevant; the argument does not hinge on how the trade group inadvertently released the document.
D: This is irrelevant; whether or not Bruch Industries wants its membership to be known does not affect the argument.

A: The argument does not suggest that Bruch Industries wants to belong to the trade group; thus, this option is irrelevant to the argument.
B: The argument states that the document lists "hundreds" of manufacturing companies, and the trade group representative confirmed that all of them belong to the trade group. Thus, this option is incorrect.
C: The argument does not address the issue of how the document was inadvertently sent out, making it irrelevant to the argument.
D: The argument provides no reason to believe that Bruch Industries would or would not want its membership in the trade group to be known.

Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist has received a document from a manufacturers' trade group that listed hundreds of manufacturing companies and the trade group representative confirms that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group. Based on this, the journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group as it is not listed on the document.
  
A: The argument doesn't depend on whether Bruch Industries wants to belong to the trade group or not. It's focused on whether they are a member or not.
  
B: This choice contradicts the argument as the journalist has stated that every company listed in the document is a member of the trade group.
  
C: This choice is irrelevant to the argument. The journalist is not trying to explain how the document was sent out but only the conclusion that can be drawn from it.
  
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument. The argument is about whether Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group or not, not why it would want to be a part of it or not.
  
E: This choice is the most accurate as the journalist relies on the accuracy of the trade group representative's statement to draw a conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group just because it is not listed in the document.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. One should exercise most days of the week, but one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits. More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the statements above?
Choices:
  A: Having a strenuous workout most days of the week can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  B: Doing the equivalent of an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week generally produces dramatic improvements in cardiovascular health.
  C: It is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week.
  D: Aside from exercise, there is no way of improving one's cardiovascular health.
  E: To obtain a dramatic improvement in one's cardiovascular health, one must exercise strenuously at least occasionally.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Exercising half an hour most days of the week can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  More vigorous exercise is more effective, but not necessary.
  
A: This is not strongly supported by the statements above. It states that a strenuous workout can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. The passage does not state that it needs to be strenuous.
B: This is not strongly supported by the statements above. The passage states that a half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week is enough to obtain cardiovascular health benefits, and does not mention anything about walking for an hour.
C: This is strongly supported by the statements above. The passage states that exercising most days of the week by doing the equivalent of a half an hour of brisk walking can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health and that vigorous exercise is more effective but not necessary.
D: This is not supported by the statements above. The passage states that modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
E: This is not strongly supported by the statements above. The passage states that more vigorous exercise is more effective, but it does not state that it needs to be done "at least occasionally".
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. 
  - One should exercise most days of the week and half an hour of brisk walking is enough to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
  - More vigorous exercise is more effective, but not necessary.
 
Analysis:
  - Option A is incorrect because it suggests that a strenuous workout is necessary most days of the week to improve cardiovascular health, which is contrary to the statement that it is not necessary.
  - Option B is incorrect because it suggests that doing an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week generally produces dramatic improvements in cardiovascular health, which is lesser than the daily half an hour brisk walking.
  - Option C is correct because it suggests that obtaining at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week. This is consistent with the statements above.
  - Option D is incorrect because it suggests that aside from exercise, there is no way of improving one's cardiovascular health, which is not related to the statements above.
  - Option E is incorrect because it suggests that one must exercise strenuously at least occasionally to obtain a dramatic improvement in one's cardiovascular health, which is not supported by the statements above.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  One should exercise most days of the week.
  Doing half an hour of brisk walking is enough on those days.
  More vigorous exercise is more effective, but not necessary.
  
A: This statement contradicts the given information, which states that more vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
B: This statement suggests that an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week produces dramatic improvements in cardiovascular health rather than half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week, which is the amount recommended in the text.
C: This statement is consistent with the information given in the text that says that doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on most days of the week is enough to obtain cardiovascular health benefits without the need for a strenuous workout.
D: This statement is not supported by the given information and contradicts the fact that cardiovascular health can be improved through exercise.
E: This statement contradicts the given information, which states that a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  - One should exercise most days of the week.
  - One need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
  - More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.

Action: Answer("C") 

The statements above suggest that doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week can produce dramatic improvements in cardiovascular health, and this is just as good as having a strenuous workout most days of the week. Therefore, this possibility is most strongly supported by the statements above. Choice A incorrectly mentions "strenuous workouts," while the statements above indicate that such workouts are not absolutely necessary. Choice B incorrectly implies that doing an hour of brisk walking is more beneficial than half an hour of walking, while the wording of the statements above does not support this inference. Choice D is entirely unsupported by the statements above. And choice E goes too far by suggesting that a "dramatic improvement" requires strenuous exercise, while the statements above indicate that modest exercise can produce such an improvement.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The statement says that modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. 
  One should exercise most days of the week, but one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
  More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  It also states that one should exercise most days of the week, but only need to do half an hour of brisk walking to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
  Additionally, the passage mentions that more vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.

Action: Answer("C") 
Choice C is the most strongly supported by the passage, as it directly states that doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week can produce at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health as having a strenuous workout most days of the week. The passage does not support choice A, B, D, or E.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that modest amounts of exercise, specifically the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week, can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. While more vigorous exercise can be more effective, it's not absolutely necessary to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
A: The passage does not state that a strenuous workout most days of the week "can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health", only that more vigorous exercise can be more effective.
B: The passage states that "one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits", not an hour, so this option is not supported by the statements above.
C: The passage specifically states that "one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits", indicating that doing so most days of the week can produce at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health as a strenuous workout most days of the week.
D: This option is contradicted by the passage, which clearly states that exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
E: The passage does not state that one must exercise strenuously at least occasionally to obtain a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  - One should exercise most days of the week.
  - Doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days produces cardiovascular health benefits.
  - More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. One should exercise most days of the week, but one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits. Additionally, more vigorous exercise is more effective but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
  
  A: This is not strongly supported by the given statements, which suggest that more modest amounts of exercise are sufficient for cardiovascular health benefits and that a strenuous workout is not necessary.
  B: This is not strongly supported by the given statements, which suggest that exercising most days of the week for the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking is sufficient for cardiovascular health benefits.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same theoretical lifespan in captivity and in the wild.
Choice evaluation:
  A: This doesn't help explain why leatherbacks have the same theoretical lifespan in captivity and in the wild.
  B: This doesn't help explain why leatherbacks have the same theoretical lifespan in captivity and in the wild.
  C: This is a distractor information, it talks about the deaths of leatherbacks in the wild rather than in captivity.
  D: This choice may help partially explain the startling discrepancy, but it does not fully resolve it.
  E: This doesn't help explain why leatherbacks have the same theoretical lifespan in captivity and in the wild.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The question presents an apparent discrepancy: leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases, but their likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is about the same as those in the wild.
  The correct option should help explain or resolve this apparent discrepancy.
A: This statement is about attachment of diseases to leatherbacks versus other aquatic reptiles, but it does not provide additional information that helps resolve the discrepancy. 
  B: This statement is about life expectancy of sea turtles in general, but it does not provide additional information that helps resolve the discrepancy.
  C: This statement is about the death of leatherbacks in the wild, but it does not provide additional information that helps resolve the discrepancy.
  D: If few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks, then it is plausible that the leatherbacks in captivity will suffer from the same diseases they would have suffered from in the wild. However, this choice does not address the apparent discrepancy specifically.
  E: If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, then the maximum theoretical lifespan of a leatherback is not strongly correlated to its size. This choice does not address the discrepancy in the statement specifically.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Leatherback sea turtles are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  The likelihood of reaching the theoretical maximum life expectancy of a leatherback is the same whether in captivity or in the wild.
  
A: This statement doesn't resolve the discrepancy, as it doesn't provide any explanation as to why leatherbacks in captivity have the same life expectancy as those in the wild.
  B: This statement doesn't resolve the discrepancy, as it compares the life expectancy of sea turtles to that of other marine animals, and doesn't add any additional information to explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same life expectancy as those in the wild.
  C: This statement doesn't resolve the discrepancy, as it provides a reason for why leatherbacks in the wild don't reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy, but doesn't explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same life expectancy as those in the wild.
  D: This statement doesn't resolve the discrepancy, as it argues that zoologists do not know how to care for captive leatherbacks, and doesn't add any additional information to explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same life expectancy as those in the wild.
  E: If the size of a leatherback is not a reliable indicator of its age, this could help explain why leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have the same life expectancy, despite being subject to different disease environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about leatherbacks, which are the largest of the sea turtles.
  They are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity but have the same likelihood to reach their maximum life expectancy as those who live in the wild.
  The passage indicates a discrepancy between these two statements.
  
A: This statement talks about other animals which is irrelevant to the question at hand.
  B: This statement is interesting but irrelevant to the question at hand.
  C: This statement provides information about the common cases of death for leatherbacks in the wild. This does not help resolve the discrepancy between leatherbacks living in the wild or captivity.
  D: This statement provides information about the knowledge of Zoologists. However, it is irrelevant to the question at hand.
  E: This statement does not help to resolve the apparent discrepancy.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherback sea turtles are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they have about the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
  A: This statement does not provide direct information to resolve the discrepancy.
  B: This statement is interesting, but does not provide direct information to resolve the discrepancy.
  C: This fact helps to explain that in the wild, leatherbacks may be killed by predators, which does not necessarily impact their life expectancy when they are not preyed upon.
  D: This statement does not help to resolve the discrepancy.
  E: This statement does not provide direct information to resolve the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy whether living in captivity or in the wild.
Choices:
  A: This statement, even if true, does not explain why leatherbacks have the same life expectancy in the wild and captivity despite being susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity. This choice can be eliminated.
  B: This statement provides additional information about the life expectancy of sea turtles and other marine animals, but it does not explain why leatherbacks have the same life expectancy in captivity and in the wild despite being susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity. This choice can be eliminated.
  C: This statement does not explain why leatherbacks have the same life expectancy in captivity and in the wild despite being susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity. If anything, it suggests that leatherback turtles in captivity might actually be safer from predators, so it does not help to resolve the discrepancy. This choice can be eliminated.
  D: This statement talks about the difficulty of establishing an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks, but it does not explain why leatherbacks have the same life expectancy in captivity and in the wild despite being susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity. This choice can also be eliminated.
  E: This statement is also not directly relevant to why leatherbacks have the same life expectancy in captivity and in the wild despite being susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity. Therefore, this choice can also be eliminated.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that leatherback sea turtles are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity and are also susceptible to be killed by predators in the wild. 
  The passage also states that the likelihood that a leatherback turtle will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether in captivity or in the wild. 
  The question asks to resolve the apparent discrepancy of the turtle's likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity and the wild. 

A: The diseases that attach leatherbacks in comparison to other aquatic reptiles is not relevant to the discrepancy mentioned.
B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is not relevant to the discrepancy mentioned.
C: The cause of death of leatherback turtles in the wild is not relevant to the discrepancy mentioned.
D: The knowledge of zoologists is not relevant to the discrepancy mentioned.

Action: Answer("E")
E: The size of a leatherback being an "untrustworthy indicator of its age" suggests that captive and wild leatherbacks may be of similar age despite their perceptive disparities. This helps to explain why captive and wild leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how leatherback turtles are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity but have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  A: This statement does not address the discrepancies between the two populations of the leatherbacks.
  B: This statement brings up a point about sea turtles in general, and it does not relate to the leatherbacks's life expectancy in captivity or the wild.
  C: This statement provides an alternative reason why leatherbacks might not survive in the wild, but it does not explain why they survive similarly in captivity compared to the wild.
  D: This statement addresses captivity but not how or why the leatherback's lifespan is similar in the wild and in captivity.
  E: This statement does not relate to the passage's discussion of captivity and the lifespan of leatherbacks.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a discrepancy between the fact that leatherbacks in captivity die from fatal diseases that they wouldn't encounter in the wild, yet the likelihood of reaching theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same in captivity and the wild. 
A: This answer choice provides information about other aquatic reptiles, not leatherbacks, and it does not help to explain the discrepancy. 
B: This answer choice provides information about the average life expectancy of sea turtles but does not help to explain the discrepancy. 
C: This answer choice provides an alternative reason for why leatherbacks perish in the wild - predator attacks - but it does not help to explain the discrepancy. 
D: This answer choice suggests that zoologists may not know how to create a healthy environment for captive leatherbacks, which would help to explain why captive and wild leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy despite captive leatherbacks being susceptible to fatal diseases not found in the wild. 
E: This answer choice provides information about the reliability of using the leatherback's size to determine its age, but it does not help to explain the discrepancy. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The passage asserts that leatherback turtles living in captivity and in the wild have a similar likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy, despite the fact that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases not found in the wild.

A: This statement is irrelevant because it doesn't explain why leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy in the wild and in captivity.

B: This statement is interesting but doesn't resolve the discrepancy presented in this passage because it compares life expectancies between different types of marine animals, rather than between captive and wild leatherbacks.

C: This statement presents a reason why leatherback turtles living in captivity and in the wild have similar life expectancies but this doesn't have a direct relation to the problem presented in the question.

D: This statement also doesn't have a direct relation to the problem presented in the question. It's never mentioned that zoologists are having problems creating a captive environment that's suitable for the leatherbacks.

E: This statement is irrelevant and doesn't explain why there would be similar life expectancies between captive and wild leatherbacks.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is likely that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produce for this season will be canceled. Most of the new shows they produced last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership. Furthermore, their new shows are all police dramas, and few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to strengthen the argument?
Choices:
  A: Wilke & Wilke have produced more new shows for this season than they produced last season.
  B: Most of the shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year were police dramas.
  C: None of the shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were not canceled were police dramas.
  D: All of the new shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were canceled were police dramas.
  E: None of the most popular television shows last year were police dramas.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produce for this season will be canceled because they produced mostly police dramas, which have not been popular in recent years and because of their poor viewership in the last season.
  A: The number of new shows produced for this season has no bearing on whether they will be canceled or not. 
  B: This helps to show why the new shows would also be canceled due to their similar genre.
  C: This does not add any new information to the argument.
  D: This strengthens the argument as it demonstrates that police dramas Wilke & Wilke produced last year were unsuccessful.
  E: This does not add to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Wilke & Wilke produced new television shows last season that failed to generate enough viewership and were canceled.
  Wilke & Wilke are producing new police dramas for this season.
  Few police dramas have been popular in recent years.

A: This option provides irrelevant information whereas the argument is about cancelation of new programs due to low viewership. Therefore, this option is not helpful to strengthen the argument.
B: This option states that most of the new shows produced by Wilke & Wilke last season were police dramas. This information is relevant as it shows that police dramas have previously been unsuccessful and it is likely that this trend could continue.
C: This option is also irrelevant, as it only specifies that the non-canceled shows from the previous season were not police dramas. It has no bearing on whether or not the new police dramas will be popular.
D: This option states that all of the canceled shows produced by Wilke & Wilke last year were police dramas, which supports the argument that police dramas have been unsuccessful in the past, therefore it is probable that the new police shows will suffer the same result and be canceled.
E: This option doesn't provide any relevant information about Wilke & Wilke's new programs. The argument is about their new police dramas, not other popular shows.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Wilke & Wilke produced new television programs, many of which were cancelled last season due to insufficient viewership.
  The new shows for this season are all police dramas and few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
  
A: The number of shows being produced this season is not relevant to the argument, as the conclusion is based on the unpopularity of police dramas.
B: This statement suggests that the new shows being produced this season are also police dramas and supports the argument that the new shows will also likely be canceled due to the unpopularity of police drama shows.
C: This statement does not provide relevant information on the new shows being produced this season, it only refers to shows from last season.
D: If all the new shows produced last season that were canceled were police dramas, this supports the conclusion that the new police dramas being produced for this season are also likely to be canceled.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument, as it only refers to the popularity of television shows, but it doesn't specifically relate to police dramas.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument states that most of the new television programs that Wilke & Wilke produced for this season are likely to be canceled. This is because most of the new shows they produced last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership, and their new shows are all police dramas, and few police dramas have been popular in recent years.

A: It does not strengthen the argument, as more new shows produced for this season do not necessarily imply they will not be canceled. 
B: It somewhat strengthens the argument, as this information suggests that producing more police dramas this year would not increase viewership 
C: The argument does not suggest that the shows they produced last year that were not canceled were police dramas. 
D: It strengthens the argument, as it reinforces the premise that police dramas were not successful last season and are likely to be canceled again. 
E: It neither weakens nor strengthens the argument, as there could be other types of programming that are unpopular.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produced for this season will be canceled due to insufficient viewership. 
  The premise for this claim is that most of the new shows the produced last season were also canceled due to insufficient viewership and that their new shows are police dramas, which have not been popular recently. 

A: The argument is not concerned with the number of new shows produced this year compared to last year.
B: If most of the shows produced last year were police dramas, this reinforces the claim that Wilke & Wilke are not producing shows that have been popular recently. This strengthens the argument.
C: This statement provides limited, if any, support to the argument.
D: This statement reinforces the fact that police dramas have not been popular recently, which strengthens the argument. 
E: This statement does not provide support for the claim that Wilke & Wilke's productions are likely to be canceled due to insufficient viewership. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Wilke & Wilke produced new television shows last season, but most were canceled.
  The new shows they produced this season are police dramas. 
  Few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
  
A: The quantity of new shows for this season does not have a direct relationship with the viewership and popularity of the shows that were produced by Wilke & Wilke.
B: This information might be true, but it does not directly impact the argument.
C: This information is not relevant since it concerns last season shows that were not canceled.
D: This choice strengthens the argument by establishing that all of the new shows produced by Wilke & Wilke that were canceled last season were police dramas, which suggests that this season's new police dramas are also likely to be canceled.
E: This information might be true, but it does not directly impact the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Wilke & Wilke produces television programs 
- Most of the new shows produced last season had been cancelled due to low viewership.
- Their new shows are all police dramas and few police dramas have been popular recently.

A: This fact is irrelevant to the argument. Whether they produced more or less new shows this season than previously does not address the issue of whether they will be canceled.
B: If most of the shows produced last season were already police dramas, this strengthens the argument that the new shows that are all police dramas are likely to be unsuccessful as well.
C: This fact is irrelevant to the argument. Whether the successful shows from last season were police dramas is not directly related to the likelihood of success for the new shows.
D: This strengthens the argument by providing specific information that all the new shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last season that were canceled were police dramas, reinforcing the idea that the new police dramas are likely to be unsuccessful as well.
E: This fact is again irrelevant to the argument. Whether police dramas were popular last year does not address the question of whether the new shows will be successful.

A: Whether Wilke & Wilke produced more new shows for this season than they produced last season is irrelevant to the argument;
  
B: This choice is relevant to the argument because it strengthens the conclusion that the new programs they produced for this season will also probably be canceled. 
  
C: This information from choice C does not help to strengthen the argument about Wilke & Wilke’s new shows in any way. 
  
D: This choice strengthens the argument somewhat because it shows that every police drama that got canceled last year. 
  
E: The information from choice E doesn’t help to strengthen the argument about Wilke & Wilke’s new shows in any way.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that it is likely that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produce for this season will be canceled due to their poor track record.
  A: This statement provides information about the number of shows produced but does not address the issues of viewership or genre.
  B: This statement suggests that it is likely that most of the new shows they produced for this season are police dramas, which helps strengthen the argument that their new shows are unlikely to be successful.
  C: This statement is about the existing shows that were not canceled and does not provide information to strengthen the argument.
  D: This statement suggests that police dramas produced by Wilke & Wilke have a poor record of being canceled, so it supports the argument.
  E: This statement relates to the popularity of police dramas on other networks, so it does not provide information to help support the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that it is likely that most of the new television programs produced by Wilke & Wilke for this season will be canceled. This conclusion is based on two premises: First, most of the new shows they produced last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership. Second, their new shows are all police dramas, and few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information that could affect whether it is likely for the new television programs produced by Wilke & Wilke to be canceled or not.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information that could affect whether it is likely for the new television programs produced by Wilke & Wilke to be canceled or not.
  C: This statement provides a little support to the conclusion in that the shows that were not canceled last year were not police dramas. This suggests that the non-police drama shows produced by Wilke & Wilke were at least somewhat more successful than their police dramas. However, this statement does not provide enough support to strongly strengthen the argument.
  D: This statement provides some support to the argument by showing that all of the new shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were canceled were police dramas. This suggests that the cancellation of the shows might at least partially be linked to the fact that they were police dramas. However, this statement still does not provide enough support to strongly strengthen the argument.
  E: This statement directly supports the argument that it is likely that most of the new television programs produced by Wilke & Wilke for this season will be canceled. If none of the most popular television shows last year were police dramas, this would suggest that police dramas are generally not very popular, which would reinforce the conclusion that Wilke & Wilke's new shows are unlikely to be successful.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: History provides many examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. This shows that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: People correctly believe that technological innovations often cause job loss.
  B: People are often reluctant to take on new challenges.
  C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
  D: People tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations.
  E: People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety based on historical resistance to technological innovations that improved working conditions. 
  A: People's belief about technological innovations causing job loss is not relevant to the argument. Even if people believe this, it does not necessarily contradict the argument.
  B: This strengthens the claim that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety, so it does not undermine the argument.
  C: This undermines the argument. If some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, then the argument's claim that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety cannot be proven.
  D: This does not necessarily contradict the argument. Even if people can adapt to gradually implemented technological innovations, it does not mean they won't resist them.
  E: People's belief about technological innovations increasing workers' productivity is not relevant to the argument. Even if people believe this, it does not necessarily contradict the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument states that people resist technological innovations due to social inertia. 
A: This answer choice provides a possible reason for people's resistance, but it does not directly address the issue of social inertia being a more powerful determinant than comfort or safety.
B: This answer choice suggests another possible reason for people's reluctance to technological innovations, but it again does not address whether social inertia is more powerful than comfort or safety.
C: This answer choice undermines the argument by presenting an example of technological innovation being embraced by workers, which contradicts the idea that social inertia always leads to resistance.
D: This answer choice relates to people's ability to adapt to technological change, but it does not address the issue of whether social inertia is a more powerful determinant than comfort or safety.
E: This answer choice provides another possible reason for people to resist technological innovations, but it does not address the issue of social inertia being a more powerful determinant than comfort or safety.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety. The argument relies on historical examples of resistance to technological innovations to support this claim.
  A: This statement, no matter how correct, does not address the argument that social inertia is a powerful determinant of human behavior.
  B: This statement may be true, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement undermines the reasoning in the argument because it presents a counterexample. If some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, then social inertia is not always the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
  D: This statement might strengthen the argument, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  E: This statement, no matter how correct, does not address the argument that social inertia is a powerful determinant of human behavior.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument suggests that people resist technological innovations despite their desire for comfort or safety because social inertia is more powerful than those desires. 
A: This choice is related to the argument, but it does not undermine it. It is possible that workers recognize that technological innovations cause job loss but still resist them because of social inertia.
B: This choice is also related to the argument, but it does not undermine it. It is possible that people may be reluctant to take on new challenges and still resist technological innovations.
C: If true, this choice would undermine the argument. If some technological innovations are embraced by workers, it suggests that social inertia is not always more powerful than the desire for comfort or safety.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument, which is about why people resist technological innovations.
E: This choice is also not relevant to the argument, which does not depend on how workers view the impact of technological innovations on productivity.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument presented implies that people resist technological innovations even if they make their working conditions better because of social inertia.
A: The fact that people believe technological innovations often cause job loss does not clearly undermine the reasoning in the argument.
B: The fact that people are often reluctant to take on new challenges is not relevant to the argument.
C: If some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, this would indicate that social inertia is not always the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
D: If people tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations, this undermines the argument's claim that social inertia is the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
E: The fact that people correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity does not clearly undermine the reasoning in the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
If some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, then it weakens the argument that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety. This suggests that there may be other factors at play beyond social inertia. The other choices either do not address the central argument about social inertia or do not seriously undermine the argument.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is a powerful determinant of human behavior regardless of the potential benefits of technological innovations.
  A: This statement is not enough to undermine the argument because the argument does not suggest that people don't have good reasons to resist technological innovations.
  B: This statement does not address the argument directly.
  C: This statement weakens the argument because it contradicts the idea that technological innovations are always resisted by people.
  D: This statement, if true, would support the argument rather than undermine it.
  E: This statement is not enough to undermine the argument because the potential benefits of technological innovations are not the focus of the argument. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is a bigger determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety. It supports this claim by arguing that people resist technological advancements even if their working conditions are miserable.
  A: This choice doesn't address the role of social inertia or the desire for comfort/safety in the argument.
  B: This choice suggests that people are indeed reluctant to take on new challenges, which would support the original argument, rather than undermine it.
  C: This choice undermines the original argument, as it suggests that people can sometimes welcome changes, even if their current situation is miserable.
  D: This choice supports the original argument, but it doesn't undermine it.
  E: This choice is irrelevant to the argument. Even if technological innovations increase workers' productivity, people might still resist them due to social inertia.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety when resisting technological innovation. 
A: While people might be resistant to new technology if they believe it will cause job loss, this wouldn't necessarily contradict the argument. 
B: This might be true, but it doesn't necessarily contradict the argument since we are concerned with the reason for resistance to technological innovation.
C: If some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, then this contradicts the argument.
D: This may be true, but it doesn't necessarily contradict the argument since we are concerned with the reason for resistance to technological innovation.
E: This may or may not be true, but it doesn't necessarily contradict the argument, as the argument is concerned with what drives resistance to technological change. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument suggests that people resist technological innovation despite miserable working conditions without those innovations, which implies that social inertia is a stronger determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  A: This may explain a concern that some people have about technological innovations, but it does not necessarily undermine the argument that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
  B: This supports the idea that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety, which strengthens the argument, rather than undermining it.
  C: This statement contradicts the argument that people resist technological innovations, hence it undermines the argument.
  D: This indirectly supports the argument that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
  E: This may or may not be true, but it does not attack the argument that social inertia is a stronger determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: We can be sure that at least some halogen lamps are well crafted, because halogen lamps from most major manufacturers are on display at Furniture Labyrinth. Any item on display at Furniture Labyrinth is well crafted.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above?
Choices:
  A: We can be confident that the temperature will drop abruptly on at least one day this week, for there is a chance of storms most days this week; whenever there are storms, the temperature drops suddenly.
  B: We can be positive that there are at least a few disturbing sonnets, given that Melinda has written several different kinds of sonnets; everything Melinda writes is disturbing.
  C: We can be sure that Gianna will get at least some good mechanical work done to her car, because she can have her car worked on at any of several shops in the city, and every shop is capable of doing good mechanical work.
  D: We can be positive that at least some minnows are healthy, because many different species of minnow can be found in lakes nearby, and every lake nearby is teeming with healthy fish.
  E: We can be confident that the cornmeal used at Matteo's Trattoria is healthful and organic, since cornmeal is among the ingredients used in preparing meals there; whenever a meal is prepared at Matteo's Trattoria, only healthful, organic ingredients are used.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The argument states that since "Hero" already dominates the market and any product with more than 50 percent sales in the market is, by definition, dominant in the market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so. 

A: This error in reasoning is not committed in the argument.
B: This error in reasoning is not committed in the argument.
C: This error in reasoning is not committed in the argument.
D: This error in reasoning is not committed in the argument.
E: This error in reasoning is committed in the argument. The argument assumes that the survey results that showed that "Hero" dominated the market in the past will also hold true in the future without providing any evidence to support this assumption. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument relies on market share to define "Hero" as already dominating the soft-drink market. The survey results show that 72% of all consumers consider it to be dominating the market. 

A: This choice deals with causation, which is not the main focus of the argument. 
B: This choice also does not seem relevant to the argument as it mainly discusses a distinction in condition(s).
C: This choice doesn't apply in this scenario since the argument is not considering the failure of proving something false as true.
D: This choice doesn't apply in this scenario since the argument is not solely relying on the belief of the claim to show that it is true.
E: This choice seems relevant since future market trends may not necessarily follow the same as past trends. 
Action: Answer ("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents the following points: (1) The company is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market with an advertising campaign. (2) 72 percent of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market. (3) Any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market. (4) Therefore, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and needs only to maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
  
A: This answer option is not relevant to the argument since it does not include anything about the relationship between cause and effect.
  
B: This answer option is not relevant to the argument since it does not include anything about the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions.

C: This answer option is not relevant to the argument since it does not include anything about establishing or disproving a specific claim.

D: This answer option is not relevant to the argument since it does not include anything specific about the relationship between belief and truth.

E: This answer option correctly identifies a potential issue with the argument. The argument is assuming that the survey results from the past will necessarily continue in the future. However, the argument does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the soft-drink market.
  The argument uses the survey results to support this claim.
  The survey results show that 72 percent of all consumers think "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that "Hero" has more than 50 percent of the sales in the market. 
  
Error in Reasoning:
The argument is mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result, so the best answer is B.
Option A is not the error in reasoning committed since the argument does not focus on the cause-and-effect relationship.
Option C and D are not the errors committed in reasoning since the argument is not related to the truth or falsity of the claim and not based on the belief of individuals.
Option E is not the error committed since the argument is not talking about the past or future but rather the current dominance of Harrold Foods in the market. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the dominance of Harrold Foods in the soft-drink market.
  The argument uses survey results that claim 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market.
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share to continue doing so.
  
Analysis:
  A: The argument does not appear to commit this error.
  B: The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share to continue doing so, which suggests that the condition by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result. This could be the error in reasoning.
  C: The argument does not appear to commit this error.
  D: The argument does not appear to commit this error.
  E: The argument does not make any statements about survey results in the future.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that since Hero has more than 50% of the sales in the market, it is by definition dominant and can continue to dominate even if they don't increase their market share.
  
A: This choice refers to a situation where the cause and the effect of a certain condition are confused, which does not apply here.
B: This choice refers to mistaking one condition, which is required to achieve a certain outcome, for a guarantee of that outcome. Harrold Foods correctly identified that more than 50% of the sales in the market is a condition for dominance, but it does not guarantee it. However, this alone is not the error in reasoning committed by the argument.
C: This choice one is not applicable here since there were no categorical claims made in the argument that need to be established as true or false.
D: This choice deals with the idea that having evidence of people's belief in a claim is not the same as having evidence of the claim itself being true. This is not the error in reasoning committed by the argument.
E: The argument is making a projection into the future based on past events, but it is not quite as absolute as stating that past events are "bound" to occur in the future. However, this choice is the most applicable because the conclusion assumes that future dominance is guaranteed regardless of other market forces, which cannot be reasonably assumed from past data.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that Harrold Foods already dominates the market based on survey results indicating that 72 percent of consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market.
A: This is not applicable to the argument.
B: This is not applicable to the argument.
C: This is not applicable to the argument.
D: This is not applicable to the argument.
E: This is a potential error in the argument. The argument assumes that because 72 percent of consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market now, it will continue to do so in the future. This assumption may be false, and consumer opinions may change over time.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that Harrold Foods dominates the soft-drink market since Hero, its most popular carbonated drink product, already has more than 50% of the sales in that market.
  A: This error does not occur in the argument.
  B: This error does not occur in the argument.
  C: This error does not occur in the argument.
  D: This error does not occur in the argument.
  E: This error does occur in the argument because the argument assumes that future survey results will be similar to past survey results, but it's not necessarily true that this will be the case.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument relies on the premise that any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market.
  The argument also suggests that Harrold Foods only needs to maintain its current market share in order to continue dominating the market.
  The survey results only represent the opinion of consumers and may not accurately reflect the actual sales of the product.
  The fact that Harrold Foods dominates the market now does not ensure that it will continue to do so in the future.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
    The author of the argument claims that Harrold Foods already dominates the soft-drink market just because 72 percent of all consumers believe that Harrold's Hero drink dominates the market. The author assumes that it is sufficient to have more than 50 percent of the sales, by definition, to be dominant in the market.
    
A: This is not the error in the reasoning committed.
  B: The author assumes that having more than 50 percent sales in the market, which is a condition, is enough to dominate the market. This seems to be the error in the reasoning committed.
  C: This is not the error in the reasoning committed.
  D: This is not the error in the reasoning committed.
  E: The survey results obtained from the past cannot be used to conclude that Harrold Foods would continue to dominate the market in the future. This might be relevant to the argument, but it does not seem to be the error in the reasoning committed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Analysis:
- Option A is incorrect because the journalist said stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, but this doesn't mean that all celestial objects without lithium in their atmosphere are stars.
- Option B is incorrect because the journalist said that a brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
- Option C is incorrect because the journalist did not say that no celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
- Option D is incorrect because the journalist said that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres, but did not make any statement about objects with less mass than the Sun.
- Option E correctly summarizes the journalist's statements by saying that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. 
  - Brown dwarfs have no fully functional nuclear furnace and therefore have preservable amounts of the chemical element element lithium.
  - Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  - Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.

Analysis:
  - Choice A: This statement is false because Brown dwarfs also do not have lithium in their atmosphere even though they have more mass than planets.
  - Choice B: This statement is false because the journalist states that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, while showing that brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and hence, have lithium.
  - Choice C: This statement is false because the journalist states that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, while brown dwarfs have lithium.
  - Choice D: This statement is false because the journalist never mentions the mass of celestial objects with lithium in their atmosphere.
  - Choice E: This statement is correct because the journalist explains that only brown dwarfs, which have more mass than planets, have lithium and other celestial objects, which would have less mass than brown dwarfs, do not have lithium.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. 
  - Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  - Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  - Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  - A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Analysis:
The science journalist explains that brown dwarfs do not have fully functional nuclear furnaces, which prevents lithium from being consumed in their atmospheres. The journalist also makes reference to how stars of varying mass maintain or consume lithium in their atmospheres. 

Action: Answer("E")  
Therefore, the statement "No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere." as it reflects the explanation given for the absence of lithium in the atmosphere of brown dwarfs, is the one most strongly supported by the journalist's statements.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Analysis:
- Choice A: The journalist's statements do not mention this explicitly. It is not supported.
- Choice B: The statement is true for stars but not necessarily for brown dwarfs. The journalist's statements do not mention whether incomplete mixing in the nuclear furnace is the reason why a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere. This choice is not the best answer.
- Choice C: This is a negative statement that claims no celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf. This is not what the journalist stated, as brown dwarfs can have lithium in their atmospheres.
- Choice D: The journalist's statement actually provides support for this statement. The journalist states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres. This statement is also stronger than two preceding options.
- Choice E: The journalist's statements do not provide support for this statement. We cannot conclude that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with mass between that of a planet and a star.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer ("B")
The journalist states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Therefore, any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere must have had a nuclear furnace that did not fully mix the elements in its interior.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by mass and the presence of lithium in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because of incomplete mixing of elements.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Action: Answer("B") 
The journalist supports that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements, which means the element has not been fully consumed.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with mass between planets and stars.
  Lithium is present in stars with mass greater than the sun.
  Lithium is not present in stars with mass less than the sun.
  Brown dwarfs lack the nuclear furnace found in stars, so they do not consume lithium.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with a mass in between planets and stars.
  Lithium is present in the atmospheres of stars at least as massive as the Sun.
  Lithium is not present in the atmospheres of stars with less mass than the Sun.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and cannot consume lithium.
  
  A: This statement is not supported as some brown dwarfs and some stars with less mass than the Sun share the lack of lithium in their atmospheres.
  B: This statement is partly supported as it implies that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements, which seems to be true according to the passage.
  C: This statement is not supported by the passage as there are other possible outcomes besides having or not having lithium in the atmosphere.
  D: This statement is not supported by the passage. Brown dwarfs are an example of celestial objects with less mass than the Sun and some of them contain lithium in their atmosphere.
  E: This statement is supported by the passage as no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has a fully functional nuclear furnace to preclude the consumption of lithium.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  - Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  - Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  - Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  - A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The game publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who purchase the game.
Sales of the game now meet expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations.
The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.

A: This choice tells us that the game can be purchased from the publisher and retail outlets. This information is irrelevant to determining why the publisher is predicting that sales will exceed expectations. 
B: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then it does not necessarily indicate that sales of the game will exceed expectations. 
C: This choice tells us that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market. This information suggests that the game publisher has a good reputation, but it does not necessarily indicate why the prediction is being made. 
D: If most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, then it does not necessarily indicate that sales of the game will exceed expectations.
E: This choice tells us that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend. This information is irrelevant to determining why the publisher is predicting that sales will exceed expectations.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price.
  Sales of the game now meet expectations and rentals of the game are exceeding expectations.
Option A does not provide information that supports or undermines the prediction.
Option B suggests that the game takes a long time to complete, but it does not support the prediction.
Option C suggests that the publisher is a successful company, but it does not support the prediction.
Option D suggests that people do not keep playing the game after completion, but it does not support the prediction.
Option E suggests that some people might purchase and complete the game and give it away to a friend, which would result in additional exposure to the game, and this might increase sales in the future.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented.
  Renters who go on to purchase the game receive a rebate equal to the cost of one rental.
  Sales of the game are meeting expectations, while rentals are exceeding expectations. 
A: The fact that the game can also be purchased from the publisher directly does not significantly affect the publisher's prediction about future sales.
B: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then there may be fewer rental returns and more purchases, supporting the publisher's prediction.
C: The popularity of the publisher's other games is irrelevant to this game's sales.
D: If most players do not engage with the game extensively after completing it, it may decrease the likelihood of rentals and purchases, but it does not support the publisher's prediction of increased sales. 
E: The fact that some players give away the game after completing it may actually decrease sales, which is opposite to what the publisher is predicting. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The computer game publisher has released an adventure game that can be purchased from retail outlets or rented.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  The rate of sales meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations.
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
A: This information is not relevant to the prediction made by the publisher.
B: This information suggests that players will need to rent the game multiple times in order to complete it, which may lead to them purchasing it instead to save money. This could potentially lead to increased sales eventually, but it does not address the publisher's specific prediction that sales will soon exceed expectations.
C: Although this information supports the idea that the publisher's games are popular and therefore may have increased sales, it does not directly address the prediction made by the publisher.
D: If most people do not play the game extensively after completing it, this would suggest that they are less likely to purchase it after renting it. This weakens the publisher's prediction rather than justifying it.
E: Although some people give the game away after completing it, this is unlikely to have a big impact on the publisher's prediction. It does not suggest that sales will soon exceed expectations.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  The rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations.

A: This fact doesn't help the publisher's prediction.
B: If most players take several weeks to complete the game and the game can be rented for two-day intervals, it means that many players will rent the game more than once or they may end up purchasing it. This could justify the prediction.
C: While this fact may show that the publisher is well-known and respected in the industry, it doesn't necessarily help the publisher's prediction for this particular game.
D: This fact doesn't help the publisher's prediction.
E: This fact doesn't help the publisher's prediction.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The sales and rental of the game are both high.
  The publisher offers a rebate to renters who go on to purchase the game, which saves them a significant portion of the purchase price.
A: This statement provides an additional way to purchase the game, but it does not help to justify the prediction that sales of the game will exceed expectations. It is irrelevant information.
B: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, this may suggest that people will purchase the game instead of renting it so that they can play it for as long as they need to complete it. This could help to justify the prediction that sales of the game will exceed expectations. 
C: This statement provides additional information about the popularity of the publisher's games, but it does not help to justify the prediction that sales of this specific game will exceed expectations. It is irrelevant information.
D: This statement suggests that people who complete the game may not be interested in purchasing it afterward. This weakens the publisher's prediction that sales of the game will exceed expectations. 
E: This statement suggests that some people may purchase and complete the game but then give it away to a friend. This weakens the publisher's prediction that sales of the game will exceed expectations.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  The rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations.
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.

Action: Answer("B")
Justification: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, this suggests that they are likely to rent the game multiple times or purchase it outright if they want to continue playing it. This would both fuel rental demand and also justify the publisher's prediction that sales of the game would increase after rentals.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  Players can rent the game and get a rebate for buying the game. 

A: This information provides an alternative method for potential buyers to purchase the game, but does not directly support or dispute the publisher's prediction. 
B: If it takes players several weeks to complete the game, it suggests that they may be more likely to rent the game multiple times, but does not directly support or dispute the publisher's prediction.
C: If the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market, then it supports the prediction that sales of the game will exceed expectations.
D: This information indicates that people who complete the game may not continue to play it, but it doesn't provide any information to support or dispute the publisher's prediction that sales will exceed expectations.
E: This information provides an alternative explanation for why some people may not purchase the game, but it does not directly support or dispute the publisher's prediction.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The publisher offers a rebate for renters to purchase the game, which saves them a significant portion of the purchase price. The rate of sales meets expectations, and rentals are exceeding expectations. 

A: This option does not directly relate to the sales of the game, nor does it provide any new information about sales or rentals.
B: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then rentals would be in high demand since many people are unlikely to complete the game within two days. Therefore, this slows down the turnover of the rented game inventory, which means more people are likely to purchase it instead.
C: This option does not directly relate to the sales of this specific game.
D: This option suggests that people who complete the game do not have a strong desire to replay it, which does not support the idea that sales will increase in the future.
E: This option does not directly relate to the sales or rentals of the game.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the only reason why inflation increased was because the party's economic theories were flawed.

A: This argument is flawed because it assumes a single cause-and-effect relationship between two events, without considering other factors that may have contributed to maintaining the architecture in the valley.
B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the reason why workers will not strike is because they don't expect the opposition to cut wages dramatically, when in reality there may be other reasons why they have promised not to strike.
C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only way the company could have purchased the new patent was by selling its subsidiaries, when in reality there may be other ways the company could have raised funds.
D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that there is a single possible outcome to the rebels winning the battle, without considering other factors that may impact the population's support for the rebels.
E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason why the television station's ratings decreased was because the forecasting equipment was not a sound investment.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument above claims that because the inflation rate increased instead of decreasing, the party's economic theories were far off the mark. However, other factors might have played a role in causing the inflation rate to increase.
A: This argument assumes that a change in the valley's architecture would have occurred only if the valley people had been invaded. But there might be other reasons for architectural changes, such as a change in social or economic conditions.
B: This argument assumes that the only reason workers promised not to strike is that they thought the party would not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. But workers might have other reasons for not striking, such as fear of losing their jobs or not being able to find work elsewhere.
C: This argument assumes that the only way for the stock price to double is for the company to sell its subsidiaries and use the cash to purchase a new patent. But there might be other ways for the stock price to double, such as increased sales or profits.
D: This argument assumes that the only way residents could show support for the rebels is if the rebels had won the battle and freed the jailed rebel leaders. But residents might show support for the rebels for other reasons, such as sympathy for their cause or disapproval of the government's actions.
E: This argument assumes that the only reason for the new equipment to be worth the investment is if it increases the accuracy of weather forecasts and ratings. But there might be other benefits to the new equipment that are not reflected in weather forecasts or ratings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument above suggests that the party's economic theories were fur off the mark because the inflation rate increased despite their implementation. It assumes that if the theories were sound, the inflation rate would have decreased.
A: The argument suggests a causal relationship between the invasion and changes in the valley's architecture, and concludes that no invasion took place because architecture remained the same. This is a flawed causal relationship.
B: The argument suggests that workers will not strike because they promised not to, but it ignores other reasons why workers may not strike or may change their mind. This is a flawed assumption about causation or motivation.
C: The argument suggests that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries because the stock price did not increase, but it ignores other factors that may affect the stock price or profitability. This is a flawed assumption about causation.
D: The argument suggests that the rebels must have won the battle because residents showed support, but it ignores other possible reasons why residents may show support or why the rebels may gain support even if they have not won. This is a flawed assumption about causation or evidence.
E: The argument suggests that the new equipment is no improvement on the old because the station's ratings decreased, but it assumes that the only reason for the investment was to improve ratings, and that ratings are the only measure of improvement. This is a flawed assumption about purpose or evaluation.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and successful, the inflation rate would have decreased. But the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
A: This argument presents a causal relationship between an event and an effect. It suggests that if an event occurred, then an effect would have resulted. However, a lack of evidence of the effect does not necessarily mean that the event did not occur. 
B: This argument presents a prediction about the behavior of workers based on the fear of a political outcome. However, the promise of not striking does not necessarily indicate that workers do not believe the party will keep its promise. 
C: This argument presents a causal relationship between two events. It suggests that if one event occurred, then another event would have occurred. However, the lack of evidence of the second event does not necessarily mean that the first event did not occur. 
D: This argument presents a causal relationship between an event and an effect. It suggests that if an event occurred, then an effect would have resulted. However, a lack of evidence of the effect does not necessarily mean that the event did not occur.
E: This argument presents a causal relationship between an event and an effect. It suggests that if an event occurred, then an effect would have resulted. However, a lack of evidence of the effect does not necessarily mean that the event did not occur.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument presented uses a conditional statement to suggest that a particular outcome would have occurred if certain conditions were met. However, since the opposite of the predicted outcome occurred, it is argued that the conditions must not have been met. This is a classic example of flawed logic, where the reasoning is flawed because it assumes that only one outcome can result from a set of conditions.

A: This argument presents a conditional statement, suggesting that if something had happened (invasion or climate change), something else (changes in architecture) would have happened. And since the second event didn't occur, the first event must not have occurred either. This is similar to the flawed reasoning in the original argument.

B: This argument presents a different type of flawed reasoning. It states that if x happens, y will happen, and since y is not happening, x must not be happening either. This is different from the argument in the original question.

C: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it presents a conditional statement, suggesting that if one thing had happened (selling subsidiaries), another thing (increase in stock price) would have happened. And since the second thing did not happen, the first thing must not have happened either. This is similar to the flawed reasoning in the original argument.

D: This argument presents a conditional statement, suggesting that if the rebels won the battle, residents would show their support. And since residents are showing their support, the rebels must have won the battle. This is different from the argument in the original question.

E: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it presents a conditional statement, suggesting that if something had happened (new equipment is an improvement), something else (ratings) would have happened. And since the opposite of the predicted event occurred (ratings decreased), it is argued that the first condition must not have been met. This is similar to the flawed reasoning in the original argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument states that if the party's economic theories had been sound and succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably, but since the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark. The reasoning does not consider that there could be other variables that may affect the inflation rate.

A: This argument concludes that the valley people must not have been invaded based on the fact that there were no changes in architecture. There could be other reasons such as the people adapting to the invaders' culture, and this argument does not consider those possibilities.

B: This argument assumes that because the workers promised not to strike, it means that they do not think the party will keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.

C: This argument concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries based on the fact that the stock price did not increase in the last two years, but this reasoning does not consider other factors that may have affected the stock price.

D: This argument concludes that the rebels must have won the battle based on the people's support for them for the last three days, but there are other reasons why people may show support, such as their belief in their cause regardless of the outcome of the battle.

E: This argument concludes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old because the ratings decreased after its implementation, but there could be other reasons for the decrease in ratings, and this argument does not consider those possibilities.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The argument described in the context suggests that the party's economic theories were wrong because the inflation rate increased under their program, instead of decreasing as they expected.
A: The argument draws an unsupported conclusion from the premise that the architecture in the valley did not change. There is no necessary connection between invasion or climatic change and changes in architecture.
B: The argument misrepresents the premise that workers have promised not to strike by implying that it is proof that they do not fear a dramatic wage cut.
C: The argument relies on speculation that the stock price would have doubled if the company had sold its subsidiaries and purchased a new patent. There is no direct evidence to support the conclusion that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries.
D: The argument draws an unsupported conclusion that because city residents have shown support for rebels, the rebels must have won the battle. There is no necessary connection between showing support and winning a battle.
E: The argument concludes that the new weather forecasting equipment is no improvement on the old, based on the unsupported premise that the station's ratings would have risen if the equipment had been worth the investment.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument in the passage puts forward a conditional statement in which the consequent (decrease in inflation rate) is presented as a necessary outcome of the antecedent (implementation of the party's economic theories). Since the consequent does not come true as expected, this is used as evidence to suggest that the antecedent was also flawed. 
A: This argument presents a conditional statement, much like the passage. However, the given evidence of unchanging architecture in the valley is not necessarily linked to the premise that the valley people were not invaded. The argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. 
B: This argument also presents a conditional statement; however, the given evidence does not directly link to the premise that the workers believe the party will not cut wages. The argument commits the fallacy of begging the question. 
C: This argument presents a similar conditional statement, but the given evidence of the stock price not increasing does not necessarily imply that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries. The argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. 
D: This argument presents a conditional statement but uses the fact that the residents have shown support for the rebels as evidence for the consequent. The argument commits the fallacy of confusing cause and effect. 
E: This argument also presents a conditional statement, but the given evidence that the station's ratings decreased does not necessarily mean the new equipment is no improvement on the old. The argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that if the party's economic theories were sound, then inflation would have lessened, but since it increased, the theories were off the mark.
  A: This argument presents a conditional statement, but then infers the opposite of what the conditional statement says. 
  B: This argument suggests that if the opposition party cuts wages, workers in key industries will strike, but because they have promised not to, they must think the party won't make the cuts.
  C: This argument presents a conditional statement but infers the opposite of what the conditional statement says.
  D: This argument presents conditional statement, but then infers that the consequent is true based on evidence that could be unrelated to the antecedent. 
  E: This argument presents a conditional statement, but it inferred that the opposite of what the conditional statement says. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument describes a causal relationship that doesn't apply in this case. The inflation rate should have lessened if the party's theories were sound and if they had been implemented.
Choices:
  A: This argument describes a causal relationship but no reasoning based on an intentional action. The argument suggests a conclusion about the valley people based on a lack of evidence.
  B: This argument describes a potential outcome A and no outcome B. The argument then implies that outcome B is more likely because A didn't happen.
  C: This argument describes a causal relationship that doesn't apply in this case. The price of the stock should have doubled if the company's sales and purchases were sound.
  D: This argument describes a causal relationship that doesn't apply in this case. Residents could show great support for a failed rebel cause or any other cause.
  E: This argument describes a causal relationship that doesn't apply in this case. The accuracy of the forecast should have increased if the new equipment was worth the investment.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Government official: Residents who are foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. This is wise, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. So, ____.
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the government official's statement?
Choices:
  A: foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve
  B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries
  C: only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries
  D: foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries
  E: cabinet undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The speaker believes that cabinet secretaries should be citizens.
  The speaker believes that it is unwise to appoint someone to a position that involves duties that person should not perform.
  The speaker believes that undersecretaries are expected to serve as secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  The speaker's argument is that a foreign citizen should not be appointed to a position if that job involves duties that person should not perform. Since cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable, and the official has just argued that cabinet secretaries should be citizens, we can infer that they are suggesting foreign citizens also should not be appointed as Cabinet Undersecretaries. Thus, the best answer is B.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because there are some duties that only citizens should perform. Additionally, cabinet undersecretaries should be able to perform the duties of the cabinet secretary if necessary.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument, since the argument does not discuss citizenship for foreign citizens who serve as public servants.
  B: This choice does not necessarily follow from the argument, since the argument only addresses the role of foreign citizens in relation to the position of cabinet secretary.
  C: This choice is not supported by the argument, since the argument does not suggest that only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  D: This choice contradicts the argument, which argues that cabinet secretaries should be citizens.  
  E: This choice contradicts the argument, which claims that cabinet undersecretaries should be able to serve as cabinet secretaries when necessary.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The government official believes that cabinet secretaries perform duties that should be performed only by citizens, and so foreign citizens should not hold that position. Cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
A: The statement does not address whether foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve.
B: The statement does not address the appointment of foreign citizens to the position of cabinet undersecretary, so this choice is not a necessary conclusion.
C: This choice suggests that only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries, which is not the conclusion the government official made. 
D: This choice contradicts the government official's point that cabinet secretaries perform duties that should be performed only by citizens.
E: The government official suggests that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable, so this choice also contradicts their point.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that "no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform" and that "cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable".
  A: This choice does not logically complete the argument. It may or may not be a solution, but it is not necessary to complete the argument.
  B: This statement does not logically complete the argument since no reason or explanation is given as to why foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
  C: This statement contradicts the argument, because the argument establishes that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. If only former cabinet undersecretaries can be appointed as cabinet secretaries, then a cabinet undersecretary who is not a former cabinet secretary would be ineligible to serve as cabinet secretary.
  D: This statement contradicts the second premise of the argument that "cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens", making it illogical.
  E: This choice contradicts the second premise of the argument and does not provide a solution to complete the statement.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The government official believes that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because those positions perform duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  Additionally, undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  
A: suggests that foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship which is beyond the scope of the official's statement.
B: presents a negative view of foreign citizens serving as cabinet undersecretaries, but it does not specifically address the concerns about eligibility for cabinet secretaries.
C: states that only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries, which is not the main point of the argument.
D: contradicts the argument that cabinet secretaries perform duties that should be performed only by citizens.
E: contradicts an important part of the government official's argument, that undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The government official states that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries since some duties should be performed only by citizens. 
  Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. 

Analysis:
  Answer A does not logically complete the government official's statement since having foreign citizens serve as public servants does not necessarily mean they should be granted citizenship in the country they serve.
  Answer B could be a possibility, but it is not logically complete in the context of the statement above.
  Answer C is not logically complete since it would restrict the pool of people who could be considered for the position.
  Answer D directly contradicts the government official's earlier assertion that some duties of cabinet secretaries can only be performed by citizens.
  Answer E is not logically complete since it would leave the position unstaffed during the cabinet secretary's absence.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The government official believes that foreign citizens cannot serve as cabinet secretaries due to the duties involved.
  The official also notes that undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when necessary.
  
Action: Answer("B")

Reasoning:
  If the official believes that no one should be appointed to a position that requires duties that person cannot perform, then it would be consistent to suggest that foreign citizens also should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries. This is because undersecretaries could be called upon to perform duties of a cabinet secretary, even if they do not officially hold that position. Thus, choice B would complete the official's argument best.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The government official argues that non-citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries, since there are some duties that only a citizen can perform.
The official also notes that cabinet undersecretaries may need to stand in as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Action: Answer("B")

B is the most logical choice to complete the statement. If a foreign citizen is not eligible to be appointed as cabinet undersecretary, then that person cannot serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. This would be in line with the official's argument that certain duties should only be performed by citizens.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, 
  No one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform.
  Cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.

Action: Answer("D")  
  
Explanation: 
Option A, B and E are not supported by the right reasons that the government official cited in his argument. Neither was there any context of the appointment of foreign citizens as public servants demanding citizenship in the country. Similarly, option B and E do not fit the argument laid out, and option C is too limiting because it restricts the appointment of cabinet secretaries to only past undersecretaries; thus, option D, stating that foreign citizens should be eligible to become cabinet secretaries, serves as the most logical completion the government official's statement.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because this position involves duties that should only be performed by citizens.
  Moreover, cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  
Analysis: 
  The statement made by the official is against the appointment of foreign citizens as cabinet secretaries. The reason for stating this is that some of the duties performed by a cabinet secretary can only be performed by a citizen. Furthermore, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to stand in as cabinet secretary, and therefore, should be a citizen as well. Therefore, the option that would logically complete the argument is the one that reinforces the idea that cabinet undersecretaries should be citizens. 
  
Action: Answer("B")   
  The duty to serve as a cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable falls to the cabinet undersecretary. Therefore, the statement logically implies that cabinet undersecretaries must be citizens of the country. If they are not citizens, then they would not be able to perform the duties of the cabinet secretary when necessary. Therefore, the option that logically completes the statement is "foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries."

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Figorian Wildlife Commission suggests that wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetlands to protect wildlife.
  Figorian Development Commission believes that wetland development is necessary for growth, and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
A: This principle supports the idea of international agreement to regulate national resources when it is necessary to protect wildlife. This principle is not in line with the Figorian Development Commission's position.
B: This principle suggests that preserving wildlife supersedes economic needs of individual nations. This principle is not in line with the Figorian Development Commission's position.
C: This principle suggests that regulation should only be implemented after a certain amount of damage has already been done. The Figorian Development Commission's position is more proactive, rather than reactive.
D: This principle suggests that the aim of environmental regulation should be to prevent any further damage and not allow different degrees of damage in different nations. This principle is not in line with the Figorian Development Commission's position.
E: This principle suggests that further depletion of natural resources is imprudent. This principle does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position, which believes that wetland development is necessary for growth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues for the regulation of wetland development in order to protect wildlife and suggests that replacing wetland habitats could offset any future development.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues for the allowance of wetland development for economic growth and believes that the conservation efforts in Figoria make it different from other nations that have mishandled wetland development.
A: International agreement for regulation goes against the Figorian Development Commission's argument for Figoria's right to govern its resources.
B: Future generation rights would prioritize wildlife preservation over economic needs, so this goes against the Figorian Development Commission's position.
C: The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues for regulation regardless of the reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development, so this goes against the Figorian Development Commission's position.
D: This option suggests that environment regulation cannot have exceptions for different countries, which goes against the Figorian Development Commission's argument for Figoria's right to govern its resources.
E: This option could support the Figorian Development Commission's position that it is not imprudent to deplete natural resources if it is necessary for economic growth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes in regulating wetland development to protect species that inhabit them by developing replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that wetland development should be allowed and that they have the right to govern their own resources.

A: This statement advocates for international regulation in protecting wildlife in endangered environments, which does not support the Figorian Development Commission's view that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  B: This statement prioritizes the preservation of wildlife over economic needs, which seems to be more in line with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's view.
  C: This statement does not address the issue of wetland development and wildlife endangerment head-on, and it seems to support a more passive approach to regulation than the Figorian Development Commission's view.
  D: This statement supports more aggressive environmental regulations, which does not align with the Figorian Development Commission's view that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  E: This statement prioritizes the preservation of natural resources, but it does not address wetlands and wildlife endangerment; it might be seen as indirectly supporting the Figorian Development Commission's view. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission and Figorian Development Commission disagree about whether development of wetlands should be allowed or regulated to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that development should be allowed because it is necessary for growth and they have a right to govern their own resources.
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that development should only occur if it is offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats so that there is no net reduction of wetlands and no threat to species.
  
Analysis:
  The question asks which principle would strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  A: This would not support either position, as it suggests that national resources should only be regulated when wildlife is endangered, but does not clarify who should regulate them or to what extent.
  B: This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, as it suggests that the economic needs of individual nations should not take precedence over preserving wildlife for future generations.
  C: This would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, as it suggests that further regulation is only necessary if there is a reduction of endangered species due to commercial development.
  D: This would support the Figorian Development Commission's position, as it suggests that regulating development to prevent environmental damage is not as important as preventing any future damage, regardless of how much damage has already been done in the past.
  E: This would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, as it suggests that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission advocates for regulating wetland development in Figoria in order to protect wildlife, while the Figorian Development Commission argues that development is necessary for growth and that they have the right to govern their own resources. 
  A: This principle does not support either side of the argument; it suggests the regulation of national resources through international agreements if animals are in danger.
  B: This principle contradicts the Figorian Development Commission's position by prioritizing the preservation of wildlife over economic needs.
  C: This principle supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position by implementing regulation only after populations of endangered species have been found to reduce further damage.
  D: This principle contradicts the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position by stating that regulations must aim at preventing any further environmental damage, regardless of different levels of damage caused by different nations.
  E: This principle does not support either side of the argument; it suggests that further depletion of natural resources is imprudent. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and since it is necessary for growth, it should be allowed. They also claim that Figoria has as much right to govern its own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use. 
Option A: Implies that national resources should be regulated by an international body when wildlife is endangered. This does not support the Figorian Development Commission's argument. 
Option B: Suggests that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations. This also does not support the Figorian Development Commission's argument.
Option C: Suggests that regulation should only be implemented when endangered species are already affected, but the Figorian Wildlife Commission aims to prevent this issue before it becomes disastrous. This does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position. 
Option D: Suggests that regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. This does not support the Figorian Development Commission's argument.
Option E: This statement expresses an opinion on the prudence of allowing further depletion of natural resources but does not provide information on principles for supporting the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that to protect wildlife, wetland development in Figoria must be regulated, and replaced by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to avoid a net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species. 
The Figorian Development Commission, argues that other nations have developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife, so development in Figoria should be allowed, as it will not necessarily affect wildlife and is required for growth. They also believe Figoria has the right to govern its own resources. 

A: This principle disagrees with both arguments and suggests an international agreement to regulate national resources when wildlife is endangered.
B: This principle seems to support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position of preserving wildlife over economic needs
C: This principle seems to suggest that regulation of wetland development can only come into effect once the reduction of populations of endangered species has occurred. 
D: This principle seems to support the Figorian Development Commission's position that regulating development should not be determined by different degrees of damage to the environment by different nations.
E: This principle is in favor of preserving natural resources, but does not provide any direct support to either position.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission's position is to regulate wetland development to protect wildlife by offsetting development with the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is to allow wetland development since it might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth. They assert they have a right to govern their own resources.

A: This principle would support international regulation of national resources when wildlife endangered, which aligns with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position. It would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
B: This principle supports the preservation of wildlife over economic needs and would align with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position. It would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
C: This principle suggests only regulating development after populations of endangered species have been reduced, which would likely be opposed by both commissions.
D: This principle supports preventing any further damage to the environment and may be used to support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position. It does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
E: This principle suggests it is imprudent to deplete natural resources, but it does not directly support the position of either commission.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Development Commission opposes the Figorian Wildlife Commission because they want to allow wetland development in Figoria. They believe that wetland development is necessary for growth and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  A: This principle suggests that nations should work together to regulate national resources when wildlife is endangered, which does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  B: This principle suggests that the preservation of wildlife for future generations is more important than the economic needs of individual nations, which contradicts the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  C: This principle suggests that regulation should only occur after there has been a reduction in the populations of endangered species. This principle does not have any impact on the positions of either commission.
  D: This principle suggests that environmental regulation must aim to prevent any further environmental damage and cannot allow for different degrees of harm to the environment. This principle contradicts the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  E: This principle suggests that it is unwise to allow further depletion of natural resources. This principle does not have any impact on the positions of either commission.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that development of wetlands must be regulated to protect wildlife and proposes the construction of replacement wetland habitats as a means to offset the net reduction of wetlands.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands, and since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, they should allow development. 

Analysis:
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that it has the right to govern its own resources and that since their wetland development might not affect wildlife, they should allow development. Therefore, principles that endorse the right of nations to govern their own resources and prioritize economic growth over wildlife conservation would support their position. 

A: International agreement to regulate national resources when wildlife is endangered would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
B: The principle of intergenerational equity that emphasizes preserving wildlife for future generations over the economic needs of individual nations would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
C: The requirement for a reduction in populations of endangered species for regulation to be implemented would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
D: The principle of zero environmental damage to prevent further depletion of the environment would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
E: The idea that allowing further depletion of natural resources is imprudent would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and in accordance with basic human rights will not pass into law if the bill adversely affects the interests of very influential people.
  A: This statement contradicts the columnist's argument since the bill in question does not violate anyone's basic human rights and is favored by most people, yet it will not pass into law, which suggests that this principle is not valid.
  B: This principle justifies the columnist's reasoning by predicting that a bill favored by most citizens, but opposed by influential people, will eventually pass into law if the democracy is well-functioning.
  C: This principle is similar to the columnist's argument since it states that a bill favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: This principle is irrelevant to the argument since it refers to bills passed by a well-functioning democracy, whereas the columnist argues that the democracy is not functioning well.
  E: This principle is a weaker version of principle A and also contradicts the columnist's argument for the same reason.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
The columnist argues that a bill that would benefit most people, does not violate anyone's basic human rights, and is favored by most people will not be passed if those who oppose it are very influential. He concludes that this is evidence that, if the country is a democracy, it is not a well-functioning one. 
A: This principle states that any bill that would benefit most people and does not violate basic human rights would be passed within a few years. This is not consistent with the columnist's argument that such a bill can be blocked indefinitely if those who oppose it are influential. Hence, this principle does not justify the columnist's reasoning.
B: This principle states that a well-functioning democracy will eventually pass a bill that is favored by most people but opposed by influential people. This principle supports the columnist's argument that a bill that would benefit most people and does not violate basic human rights can be blocked indefinitely if those who oppose it are influential. Hence, this principle justifies the columnist's reasoning.
C: This principle is a variant of the principle stated in A. It also implies that a bill that would benefit most people and does not violate basic human rights can be blocked indefinitely if those who oppose it are influential. Hence, this principle justifies the columnist's reasoning similar to choice B.
D: This principle states that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and consistent with individuals' basic human rights. This does not support the columnist's argument that a bill that would benefit most people and does not violate basic human rights can be blocked indefinitely if those who oppose it are influential. Hence, this principle does not justify the columnist's reasoning.
E: This principle states that a bill favored by most people and does not violate basic human rights will be passed promptly in a well-functioning democracy. This is similar to principle A and does not justify the columnist's reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The columnist argues that a bill that would benefit most people and not violate basic human rights, will not be passed for many years, if at all because of opposition by powerful people. 
A: This principle states that any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights, This is not relevant to the situation described in the context.
B: This principle states that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This seems to support the columnist's reasoning that the democracy is not functioning well since bills supported by most are not passing into laws because of opposition by powerful people.
C: This principle states that a bill that is favored by most people will become a law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. This is in line with the reasoning of the columnist who argues that influential people are blocking the passing of a bill favored by most people.
D: This principle states that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights. This is not relevant to the situation described in the context.
E: This principle states that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights. This is not consistent with the situation described in the context. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Justification: The columnist's reasoning is based on the fact that although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all because those who would be adversely affected by the bill are very influential. So, the columnist concludes that if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one. Option A can be eliminated because the columnist does not specify any specific time frame for the bill to become law. Option C is not useful in justifying the columnist's argument because it suggests that the bill will become law only if the opponents are not very influential, which contradicts the columnist's argument that influential opponents of the bill prevent it from becoming law. Option D does not justify the columnist's argument because the argument is not about whether the bill is consistent with individuals' basic human rights; it is about the influence of the opponents of the bill. Option E is incorrect because the columnist's argument is not about the promptness with which the bill will become law. Option B is the most appropriate justification because it states that eventually any bill, which is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people in a well-functioning democracy, will pass into law.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

The columnist argues that the fact that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate basic human rights will not be passed into law because influential people oppose it suggests that the country's democracy is not functioning well. Of the options, only choice B provides a principle that helps to justify the columnist's reasoning, stating that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law if the democracy is well-functioning. Therefore, B is the best answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and that does not violate human rights may not become law if the people who oppose it are influential.
  A: This principle does not address the issue of influential people opposing a bill even if it benefits most people.
  B: This principle supports the view that a bill opposed by influential people may still pass in a well-functioning democracy.
  C: This principle is similar to the argument made by the columnist since it suggests that a bill favored by the majority may not pass if those who oppose it are influential.
  D: This principle relates to bills that have already become law in a well-functioning democracy and does not address the issue of influential people opposing a bill that is favored by most people.
  E: This principle is similar to principle A, and it does not address the issue of influential people opposing a bill that is favored by most people.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist argues that a bill that is favored by most people and doesn't violate anyone's basic human rights is unlikely to become law if those who oppose it are influential. 
  A: This principle suggests that any bill that would benefit most people should become law within a few years if it doesn't violate anyone's basic human rights, regardless of whether or not it is opposed by influential people. This does not support the columnist's argument.
  B: This principle relates to the claim that a bill that is opposed by influential people but is favored by most other people will eventually pass into law if the democracy is well functioning. However, the columnist argues that a bill that is favored by most people and doesn't violate anyone's basic human rights is unlikely to become law, even if it is opposed by influential people. This principle contradicts the columnist's reasoning.
  C: This principle is similar to the columnist's reasoning. The columnist claims that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. This principle suggests that the same condition must be met for a bill to become law in a well-functioning democracy. 
  D: This principle relates to the requirement that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy must be consistent with individuals' basic human rights. However, the columnist assumes that the bill in question does not violate anyone's basic human rights. This principle is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This principle suggests that a bill that most people favor will be passed into law within a few years if it doesn't violate anyone's basic human rights. However, the columnist argues that this bill is unlikely to become law even if it meets these criteria. This principle does not support the columnist's reasoning. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
The columnist is discussing a bill that is favored by most people but will not be passed due to the influence of a minority. This indicates that the columnist believes that this country is not a well-functioning democracy.
A: This principle states that any bill that benefits most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights. It does not take into account the influence of minorities, as such, it is not suitable to help justify the columnist's reasoning.
B: This principle supports the columnist's reasoning. It states that if a democracy is functioning well, any bill that is opposed by influential people but is popular among most other people will eventually be passed into law.
C: This principle indicates that a bill favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. However, it does not provide a clear link to the columnist's argument.
D: This principle states any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights. It does not acknowledge the influence of minority opposition, so it is not helpful in justifying the columnist's reasoning.
E: This principle states that a bill that most people favor will be passed into law promptly only if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights. It does not integrate the influence of minority opposition, so it's less useful in justifying the columnist's reasoning. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating basic human rights will not be passed, due to the opposition of influential individuals.
A: This principle opposes the columnist's reasoning by stating that any bill that benefits most people will be passed within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
B: This principle supports the columnist's reasoning by stating that any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
C: This principle supports the columnist's reasoning by stating that a bill favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
D: This principle does not speak directly to the columnist's claim about the influence of powerful individuals, it only suggests that a well-functioning democracy passes bills that are consistent with individual rights.
E: This principle opposes the columnist's reasoning by stating that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights, which is not what the columnist is claiming happens.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The columnist argues that a bill that would benefit most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law because those who would be adversely affected are influential. 
  A: This principle does not support the columnist's argument, as it states that any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights. 
  B: This principle supports the columnist's argument, as it states that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law in a well functioning democracy. 
  C: This principle does not support the columnist's argument, as it states that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. 
  D: This principle does not directly support the columnist's argument, as it states that any bill passed into law will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise
  C: criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself
  D: taking lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim
  E: presupposing what it sets out to establish
Response 0:

  The advisor was convicted of embezzlement in his youth.
  The editorial concludes that the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
A: This answer choice is not employed in the editorial's argument.
B: The editorial does not employ this argumentative strategy in its argument.
C: The argumentative strategy of criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself is employed in the editorial's argument. 
D: The editorial is not taking lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim.
E: The editorial does not employ the argumentative strategy of presupposing what it aims to establish. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The editorial argues that the premier should not listen to the economic advisor based on the advisor's past conviction of embezzlement.
  
A: This option describes the method of rejecting a proposal based on doubts of its implementation. However, this argument is not the same as the one presented in the editorial's argument.
  B: The argument seeks to convince the chief that her rejection of the economic advisor is for her own good and not something that could work against her unless she reduces taxes.
  C: The argument criticizes the source of the advice rather than examining the validity of the advice itself.
  D: This option takes a lack of evidence as evidence undermining a claim, while the article does the opposite. The editorial argues that the economic advisor's dishonesty is the reason for rejecting his economic advice.
  E: Presupposition refers to the making of an argument in the absence of concrete evidence. However, this argument is based on a specific incident that is not a presupposition.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The editorial argues that the premier should not listen to her economic advisor due to his past conviction, not because of flaws in his advice.
  A: This choice is not related to the editorial's argumentative strategy.
  B: This choice is not related to the editorial's argumentative strategy.
  C: The editorial criticizes the economic advisor's trustworthiness rather than examining the advice he gave.
  D: The editorial does not mention a lack of evidence for a claim.
  E: The editorial assumes that the economic advisor's past conviction undermines his ability to provide trustworthy economic advice.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The editorial wants to discard the hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services based on the premier's economic advisor's background.
  A: The argument does not discuss rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail.
  B: The argument does not try to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise.
  C: The argument relies heavily on criticizing the background of the premier's economic advisor instead of examining the validity of his economic advice.
  D: The argument does not take lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim.
  E: The argument can be seen to engage in circular reasoning: it assumes from the outset that the economic advisor's advice is bad because of his past, but then cites that bad advice as a reason to distrust him.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The editorial is providing a criticism of the premier's economic advisor, who had a previous conviction of embezzlement when he was younger.
  
A: This choice is not relevant to the argument of the editorial.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument of the editorial.
C: This is the correct answer because the editorial employs the strategy of criticizing the source of a claim, rather than examining the claim itself. The editorial raises doubts about the reliability of the economic advisor's advice on the basis of his personal history (i.e. his earlier conviction), rather than on the merits of his advice on reducing wasteful spending.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument of the editorial.
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument of the editorial.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The editorial argues that the premier should not listen to her economic advisor because, in the past, he was convicted of embezzlement. The editorial contends that the advisor's economic advice is untrustworthy.
A: This describes the argumentative strategy of questioning the feasibility of a proposal.
B: This describes the argumentative strategy of using fear-mongering to win support.
C: This describes the argumentative strategy of attacking the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself.
D: This describes the argumentative strategy of attacking a claim based on a lack of evidence.
E: This describes the argumentative strategy of presupposing what the editorial sets out to establish.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  An editorial is an article that represents the official view of a newspaper on a particular topic.
  A: It is legitimate to reject a proposal if a particular implementation of it is likely to fail.
  B: Trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument.
  C: The editorial's argument criticizes the source of economic advice rather than examining the actual advice.
  D: Taking lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim is a logical fallacy, but it is not employed in the editorial's argument.
  E: Presupposing what it sets out to establish is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  An argumentative strategy is questionable when it is not logically sound or it employs fallacious reasoning.
A: The argument only rejects the proposal because of the untrustworthiness of the economic advisor, not because the implementation is likely to fail. Incorrect.
B: The argument does not attempt to win support by playing on fears directly. Incorrect.
C: The argument criticizes the economic advisor rather than his advice. Correct.
D: There is no instance of the argument taking lack of evidence as evidence against any claim. Incorrect.
E: The argument does not presuppose what it sets to establish. Incorrect.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The editorial argues that the premier should not listen to a particular advisor because he was convicted of embezzlement.
  The argument implies that the advisor's past conviction for embezzlement is sufficiently relevant to his current role as economic advisor that his advice should be rejected.
  A: This choice is not relevant because the argument does not reject the proposal based on implementation.
  B: This choice is not relevant because the argument does not play on people's fears.
  C: This choice accurately describes the argumentative strategy employed by the editorial, which criticizes the advisor's character instead of examining his advice.
  D: This choice is not relevant because the argument does not take lack of evidence as evidence undermining a claim.
  E: This choice is not relevant because the argument does not presuppose what it sets out to establish.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The biologist's argument is that humans would be content with a configuration of six fingers if we descended from a fish with six phalanges.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the biologist's argument, which is about the possible contentment of humans if we had evolved from a fish with six phalanges.
  B: This choice suggests that humans cannot be content with things that are of unequal usefulness, but the argument is not about the usefulness of fingers. Therefore, this choice is not relevant.
  C: This choice states that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness, but the argument does not rest on the possibility of equal usefulness of configurations of fingers. Therefore, this choice is not relevant.
  D: This choice strengthens the biologist's argument because it posits that the perceived usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is an illusory product of our prejudices. Therefore, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges, we would similarly believe that such a configuration is just as useful as our current configuration, and therefore be equally content with either configuration.
  E: This choice is interesting, but it doesn't strengthen the argument that humans would be content with a configuration of six fingers if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges. It only provides evidence for an alternative evolutionary pathway.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The biologist argued that humans descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins, which is why humans have five fingers. The biologist also claimed that humans would be just as content with a configuration of six fingers on each hand and that several other possible configurations of fingers would be just as useful as our present configuration. 

A: This statement does not provide any evidence or support for the biologist's argument.
B: This statement goes against the biologist's argument because the biologist explicitly stated that the configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
C: This statement goes against the biologist's argument because the biologist explicitly stated that the configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perceived usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not based on actual utility, but rather on our prejudices. 
E: This statement is irrelevant to the biologist's argument because the biologist did not discuss any other species of fish or their phalangeal configurations.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The biologist is arguing that the number of fingers humans have is arbitrary and that their utility is not inherent to their number, but rather culturally constructed. 

A: This statement fails to provide evidence to support the biologist's argument.
B: This statement actually weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness.
C: This statement is just an unsupported generalization and does not contribute to the argument.
D: This statement strengthens the biologist's argument by suggesting that utility is not inherent in the number of fingers humans have, but rather a result of our prejudices.
E: This statement is neutral and does not strengthen or weaken the biologist's argument. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that our configuration of five fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement contradicts the biologist's argument and is not relevant.
  C: This statement, while in agreement with the biologist's argument, doesn't provide further support to it.
  D: This statement provides some support to the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not objective but rather influenced by our prejudices.
  E: This statement supports the biologist's argument because it provides a hypothetical basis for the idea that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if they had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist claims that our configuration of fingers is not inherently better or worse than other configurations, and that we would be content with a different configuration if that was what we had descended from.
  A: This statement provides no evidence for or against the biologist's claim.
  B: This statement contradicts the biologist's claim, as it suggests that humans are not content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement also contradicts the biologist's claim, as it suggests that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: This statement is consistent with the biologist's claim, as it suggests that our beliefs about the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers are not based in reality.
  E: This statement supports the biologist's claim by providing evidence that a fish with six phalanges in its fins actually existed, which strengthens the plausibility of the biologist's hypothetical scenario where humans descended from a similar fish and evolved to have six fingers per hand. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The biologist argues that the number of fingers we have is not inherently better than other possible configurations, and that we would be content with other configurations if that's what we had descended from. 
A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the biologist's argument and provides no information that strengthens it.
B: This answer choice contradicts the biologist's argument and therefore weakens it.
C: This answer choice goes along with the biologist's argument, but does not strengthen it since it just restates the argument.
D: This answer choice is irrelevant to the question of whether or not humans would be content with a different number of fingers.
E: This answer choice supports the biologist's argument because it shows that the possibility of a different number of phalanges in fish fins is not far-fetched.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of the fingers on the human hand is a result of evolutionary history.
  A: This statement does not help strengthen the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement creates an unsupported premise that humans never accept two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: This statement creates an unsupported premise that humans always accept two things of equal usefulness.
  D: This statement is in line with the biologist's argument that human preferences are shaped by prejudices.
  E: This statement creates an example that supports the biologist's argument that fish with other phalanx numbers have existed. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's argument states that the configuration of five fingers humans have is not necessarily the only or the best option, and that humans could have been content with six fingers had we descended from a fish with six phalanges.
  A: This statement does not provide evidence that humans are content with any number of fingers and it does not provide evidence to support the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement makes a claim about human behavior towards "two things of unequal usefulness", which is not directly relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement makes a claim about human behavior towards "two things of equal usefulness", which is not directly relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that the perceived usefulness of our current finger configuration is not based on any objective or inherent quality, but rather on our prejudices.
  E: This statement provides evidence that at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, which supports the possibility that humans could have descended from a fish with six phalanges and been content with six fingers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The biologist argues that the configuration of fingers in humans is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  Options A, B and C are unrelated to the biologist's argument.
  Option D supports the biologist's argument by saying that our view of the perceived usefulness of the configuration of fingers is not based on any objective facts.
  Option E is related to the biologist's argument as it provides evidence that some species of fish have six phalanges in its fins.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The biologist's argument is that humans' having five fingers is due to historical evolution and that having six fingers would be equally useful.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the Biologist's argument because the argument is not about the contentment of everyone in relation to our current finger configuration.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the Biologist's argument because it addresses the contentment of humans with two things of unequal usefulness, which is not related to the argument being made.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the Biologist's argument because it is too general and does not address the specific point being made about finger configuration.
  D: This statement is relevant to the Biologist's argument because it suggests that our perception of the usefulness of five fingers could be based on unsupported beliefs. 
  E: This statement is somewhat relevant to the Biologist's argument because it suggests that the possibility of having six phalanges in its fins exists.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Dried parsley should never be used in cooking, for it is far less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley is.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most clearly helps to justify the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
  B: Only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used in cooking.
  C: Ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful.
  D: Parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking.
  E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: The argument points out a specific problem with the use of dried parsley in cooking. 

A: While fresh ingredients may be preferable in some cases, this principle is too broad to justify the argument above. 
B: This principle introduces a subjective judgment about the desirability of taste that is irrelevant to the argument. 
C: This principle suggests, by means of a broad generalization, what the argument claims about dried parsley. However, it does not provide a reason why this should be so.
D: This principle is too limited in scope and details to justify the argument, which make a claim about dried parsley in general.
E: This principle directly supports the argument, suggesting that dried parsley is generally inferior to fresh parsley. 

Therefore, the best answer is E.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
The argument is suggesting that dried parsley is inferior to fresh parsley in terms of both taste and healthfulness.

A: This statement is related, but does not help justify the argument.
B: This statement is not justified by the argument. The argument is focused on the taste and health benefits of the parsley, not overall taste of ingredients. 
C: This statement is related, but not specific to the argument. 
D: This is a restatement of the argument, not a principle that helps justify it.
E: This principle most directly supports the argument, as it claims that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ones.

Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  A: This principle is too broad and does not directly address the use of dried parsley.
  B: The argument does not claim that only the tastiest ingredients should be used in cooking.
  C: This principle is too broad and not necessarily true in all cases. It also does not directly address the use of dried parsley.
  D: The argument does claim that parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should not be used, but it does not specifically mention that only fresh parsley is both tasty and healthful.
  E: This principle directly relates to the argument and supports the claim that dried parsley is inferior to fresh parsley in cooking.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument above states that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  A: This principle is similar to the argument in the passage, but it is too general and not completely relevant.
  B: This principle is not relevant to the argument in the passage.
  C: This principle is too general and not completely relevant.
  D: This principle is too specific and not completely relevant.
  E: This principle has been used directly in the argument in the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that using dried parsley in cooking is less tasty and healthful than using fresh parsley. 
  A: This principle suggests that fresh ingredients should be used, but it doesn't necessarily justify the argument above.
  B: This principle is too extreme and subjective as what may be considered tastiest to one person may not be to another. It also doesn't necessarily relate to the argument above.
  C: This principle is too strong and does not address the argument above.
  D: This principle is too strong. The argument stated that dried parsley should not be used, not that it should only be used if it's both tasty and healthful.
  E: This principle is very similar to the argument and helps to justify it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge:
- The argument states that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
- It tries to prove that dried parsley should never be used in cooking.

A: The principle argues that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking, whenever possible. This principle most clearly helps to justify the conclusion, as it agrees with the claim that fresh parsley should be used instead of dried parsley.
B: The principle argues that only the tastiest ingredients should be used in cooking. This is a subjective principle, and not a valid principle to support the argument.
C: The principle argues that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful. While this principle is somewhat similar to the argument's conclusion, it is too strong and vague to support the argument.
D: This principle argues that parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking. However, this principle is not stated in the argument and is too specific to support the argument.
E: This principle argues that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients. While this principle is similar to the argument's conclusion, it is too general and vague to support the argument.

Thus, the principle that best justifies the argument is that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument presents dried parsley as a less tasty and healthful option compared to fresh parsley.
  
  A: This statement addresses the use of fresh ingredients, but it does not clearly justify why dried parsley should not be used.
  B: This statement is an exaggeration, as taste is subjective and not the only factor to consider in cooking.
  C: This statement is too general, as there are probably exceptions of ingredients that are not tasty or healthful but can still be used in cooking.
  D: This statement is too extreme, as some parsley that is not entirely healthful or tasty can still be used in cooking without causing harm.
  E: This statement strengthens the argument, as it presents a general principle that supports the idea that fresh parsley is superior to dried parsley.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  
A: The principle stated here is useful for providing some justification for the argument, but it is not strong enough by itself to justify the argument.
  B: This principle is too extreme and not useful for justifying the argument.
  C: This principle addresses the issue of healthfulness, but it does not address the tastiness of the ingredient or the argument's claim that the ingredient should "never" be used.
  D: This principle is too extreme and does not address the fact that fresh parsley will generally be more flavorful and healthful than dried parsley, even if the dried parsley is still okay to use.
  E: This principle matches the argument's claim and supports it well. If dried ingredients are generally inferior to fresh ingredients, then it makes sense that dried parsley would be less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  
A: The principle states that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible. It supports the argument since the argument uses fresh parsley as a comparison to dried parsley.
  B: The principle states that only the tastiest ingredients should be used in cooking. It is too extreme. Furthermore, the argument does not state that dried parsley is untasty.
  C: The principle states that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful. It goes the other way around from the argument. The argument says that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful compared to fresh parsley, it did not say that dried parsley should never be used.
  D: The principle states that parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking. It is too extreme - it makes the assertion that dried parsley should never be used. The argument employs a comparison, not an absolute.
E: The principle states that in cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients. This principle supports the argument directly and justifies the assertion about parsley in the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
Choices:
  A: This principle advocates for using fresh ingredients in cooking whenever possible, which is generally a common cooking practice, but it doesn't necessarily justify why dried parsley should never be used in cooking.
  B: This principle argues that only the tastiest ingredients should be used in cooking, which is a subjective statement and it doesn't justify why dried parsley should never be used in cooking. 
  C: This principle claims that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful, which supports the argument that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  D: This principle suggests that parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking, which seems overly restrictive, and also ignores the fact that dried parsley may be less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley but it can still be used in some recipes.
  E: This principle states that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients, which supports the argument that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely an actuary because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement, and the embezzler MUST have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records. 

A: Weakens the detective's argument, because it suggests that the accountants could have been closely scrutinized by their supervisors and therefore less likely to embezzle.
B: Weakens the detective's argument, because it suggests that someone outside of XYZ Corporation could have committed the crime, despite the need for specialized knowledge.
C: Weakens the detective's argument, because it suggests that there are more accountants that could have committed the crime than actuaries.
D: Has no effect on the detective's argument because it occurred before the crime took place.
E: Weakens the detective's argument, because it suggests that it may have been more difficult for the actuaries to commit the crime than the accountants. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler probably was one of the actuaries because the inaccuracies in ledger entries suggest that only an actuary, and not an accountant, could have made them.
  A: If it were the case that supervisors scrutinized the work of actuaries more closely, this would weaken the detective's argument. It would suggest that it would be more likely that an accountant would have been caught making the kind of mistakes that the detective cited as evidence.
  B: If this were the case, it would suggest that the detective's presumption that the embezzler must have worked for XYZ Corporation may be incorrect. However, it would not necessarily follow that the embezzler was an accountant rather than an actuary if access had been gained through a breach in security.
  C: If there are eight accountants and only two actuaries on staff, then this would weaken the detective's argument to some extent. However, it would not necessarily follow that one of the accountants had committed the crime. 
  D: This information is not relevant to the detective's argument.
  E: If it were more difficult for the actuaries to have access to the internal financial records, this would suggest that it is less likely that one of the actuaries committed the embezzlement, but would not necessarily strengthen the argument that an accountant committed the crime.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The detective believes that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, and based on the mistakes made, it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries rather than an accountant. 
  A: If the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized, this could actually support the detective's argument that it is less likely that an actuary committed the crime as there would be a smaller window of opportunity.
  B: If someone outside the corporation could have accessed the records, this could weaken the detective's argument that it must be an employee who committed the crime.
  C: The number of accountants vs actuaries does not necessarily weaken or strengthen the detective's argument about who committed the crime.
  D: The report's conclusion made before the embezzlement does not directly relate to the detective's argument about who committed the crime.
  E: If it was more difficult for actuaries to access the records, this could actually support the detective's argument that it is less likely that an actuary committed the crime.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The detective argues that the embezzler is an actuary based on the presumption that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge of and access to internal financial records. The detective also suggests that an accountant would be less likely to make mistakes in ledger entries. 
  A: The increased level of scrutiny on the actuaries would actually strengthen the detective's argument. 
  B: If persons outside the corporation had access to internal financial records, it means it could have been someone other than an accountant or actuary in the company, and thus weakens the detective's argument.
  C: The ratio of accountants to actuaries is irrelevant to the argument, and thus does not weaken it.
  D: The independent report may suggest that someone other than an actuary or an accountant was possibly responsible for the potential embezzlement, and thus weakens the argument.
  E: If the security measures made it difficult for the actuaries to have access, it suggests that another person or group with better access committed the crime, thus weakening the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The detective's argument is based on the premise that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records. 
  Accountants are less likely to make mistakes in ledger entries than actuaries. 
  A: If actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized than accountants' activities, this would weaken the argument that the embezzler is an actuary.
  B: If somebody outside of the corporation accessed the records, then the detective's argument about the embezzler's identity falls apart. 
  C: This number difference has no effect on the detective's argument. 
  D: Just because there was a past report does not mean the embezzlement did not take place or that the analysis of the situation is incorrect.
  E: If the security measures defense was stronger for accountants than for actuaries, this would weaken the argument that the embezzler is an actuary.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The detective presumes that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary.
  An accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  Thus, the detective concludes that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
  A: Supervisors were more closely scrutinizing the actuaries, so it might not be as easy for the actuaries to carry out the embezzlement. This weakens the detective's argument.
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to internal financial records then it would imply that the embezzler could also be someone from outside the organization. This weakens the detective's argument.
  C: The number of accountants and actuaries in the company does not necessarily have any impact on the detective's argument, so this option is not relevant.
  D: An independent report before the crime reduces the likelihood that the embezzler is an internal employee; but the argument is not a claim of safety or threat of external force. This option is not relevant.
  E: Certain security measures making access to internal financial records more difficult for the actuaries reduces the likelihood that the embezzler is one of the actuaries, so this weakens the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The detective presumes that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. However, the detective thinks that an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus, it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
  
A: If the actuaries were more closely monitored, it would be less likely that they committed the crime. Hence, this weakens the detective's argument.
B: If someone outside the corporation was able to gain access to internal records, it would suggest that outsiders had committed the crime. Thus, this weakens the detective's argument.
C: This suggests that accountants were more likely to have committed the crime. However, the detective thinks it is unlikely that an accountant made such mistakes. Hence, this statement supports the detective's argument.
D: This statement suggests that the crime was easier to commit. Thus, this supports the detective's argument.
E: If the security measures made it difficult for the actuaries to have access to the records, it means it is less likely that they have committed the crime. Hence, this weakens the detective's argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The detective has argued that the embezzler is most likely one of the two actuaries because an accountant would not have made the mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: If the actuaries were more closely scrutinized by supervisors, then it would be less likely that one of them would have been able to embezzle funds undetected. This weakens the detective's argument.
  B: If someone outside the corporation could have had access to the financial records, then it is possible that the embezzler was not an accountant or an actuary. This weakens the detective's argument.
  C: This fact does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument.
  D: This fact, which occurred before the embezzlement, does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument about who committed the crime.
  E: If it was more difficult for actuaries to have access to the records, then it would be less likely that one of them would have been able to commit the embezzlement. This weakens the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler likely worked as an actuary, as opposed to an accountant. The argument is supported by the assumptions that accountants would not make similar mistakes, and that the embezzler had specialized knowledge and access to internal records. 
  A: This choice actually strengthens the detective's argument by suggesting that the accountants are less likely to have committed the crime because their activities were more closely scrutinized.
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to internal financial records, it weakens the argument that the embezzler is an internal actuary or accountant.
  C: This choice does not explicitly weaken the argument but does not provide information relevant to the argument.
  D: This choice is irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about an independent report released before the crime.
  E: If certain security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records, it weakens the argument that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The detective argues that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records and that it is likely the embezzler is one of the corporation's actuaries, because the mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement would not have been made by an accountant.
A: This statement undermines the detective's argument by suggesting that close scrutiny of the actuaries is likely to catch errors, making it less likely that an actuary would be the embezzler.
B: This statement weakens the detective's argument by suggesting the possibility that persons outside the company could have committed the crime.
C: The number of accountants and actuaries is not relevant to the detective's argument.
D: The fact that an independent report previously identified a vulnerability to embezzlement does not affect the plausibility of the detective's argument that an actuary is the embezzler.
E: This statement weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that the actuaries may not have had equal access to internal financial records as accountants.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film so that it can make a profit. 
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Choice A:
  The fact that people are willing to see a film more than once does not explain why movie executives want to maximize the number of people who see a film and why television executives do not have the same goal.
Choice B:
  The fact that there is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers does not explain why movie executives want to maximize the number of people who see a film and why television executives do not have the same goal.
Choice C:
  The fact that the average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television does not explain why movie executives want to maximize the number of people who see a film and why television executives do not have the same goal.
Choice D:
  This choice best explains the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives. Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. Therefore, the primary goal of television executives is to produce shows that attract the right demographic for their sponsors.
Choice E:
  The fact that over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch does not explain why movie executives want to maximize the number of people who see a film and why television executives do not have the same goal.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Movie executives primary goal is to maximize the number of people who see a film because the profit of a film is determined by the number of people who see it.
  Television executives have a different primary goal.
Choices:
  A: If a person sees a film more than once, it may be counted as a new viewer every time they see it. This may increase the number of viewers, but it does not explain the difference in the goals of movie and television executives.
  B: This answer choice suggests a difference in the way that movie theaters and television shows generate profits, but it does not explain why movie executives focus on maximizing viewers while television executives do not.
  C: This answer choice suggests a difference between the average production costs of films and television shows, but it does not explain why movie executives focus on maximizing viewers while television executives do not.
  D: This answer choice provides a reason why television executives may not be concerned with maximizing the number of viewers, since the profit of television shows comes mainly from sponsors who care about the purchasing power of the viewers. This answer choice helps to explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  E: This answer choice provides information about the popularity of television shows that do not require payment to watch. This information does not explain the difference in the goals of movie and television executives. 
Action: Answer("D")

B: The fact that there is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers is irrelevant.
C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television but it does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.

E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch. This suggests that the goal of television executives may be to maximize ratings in order to attract sponsors, rather than to maximize profits.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film in order to generate more profits. The film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it.

  A: It is about repeating the view, but it is irrelevant to assisting in explaining the difference in goals between TV and movie executives. 
  B: It doesn't have a relation to the primary goals of movie or television executives and their profit. 
  C: This option indicates that it’s more expensive to produce a film than a television show but doesn't explain the difference in goals between television executives and movie executives. 
  D: This could be an explanation. If the sponsors are concerned about the purchasing power of the people watching the show, the TV executives would be less concerned with the number of viewers and more focused on attracting viewers with high purchasing power.

Knowledge:
  Movie executives aim to maximize the number of people who see a film to generate revenues from ticket sales.
  Television executives do not aim to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Choices:
  A: The fact that more people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show may reflect viewer preferences but does not help explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  B: The fact that there is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers suggests a difference in the business models of movie theaters and television networks but does not help explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  C: The fact that the average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television suggests that movie executives have greater financial risks than television executives, but does not by itself help to explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  D: The fact that television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, does suggest a difference in priorities between movie and television executives. If television executives are concerned with audience demographics, then attracting maximum viewers may not be their primary goal.
  E: The fact that over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch may reflect differences in distribution methods for television and movie content, but it does not by itself help to explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Movie executives aim to maximize the number of people who see a film because it is the way to make profits.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  
A: This answer might explain why movie executives want more people to see films, but it does not explain why television executives have a different goal than movie executives.
B: This answer compares the profits of movie theaters with the profits of television executives, but it does not explain why television executives have a different goal than movie executives.
C: This answer explains a difference between the costs of producing movies and television shows, but it does not explain why television executives have a different goal than movie executives.
D: This answer suggests that television executives have a different goal than movie executives because of the financial goals of sponsors, which is a relevant explanation.
E: This answer might explain why some TV shows do not depend on profits from ticket sales, but it does not explain why television executives have a different primary goal from movie executives.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Movie executives primary goal is to maximize the number of people who see a film, while television executives' goal is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows. 
  A: Movie viewers are more willing to see a film more than once than to watch a television show more than once; however, this is not enough to explain the primary goal difference between movie and TV executives.
  B: Owners of movie theaters make a large profit by selling refreshments, but this is irrelevant to the primary goal difference between movie and TV executives.
  C: The cost of producing an hour of film is greater than the cost of producing an hour of television; however, this is not enough to explain the primary goal difference between movie and TV executives.
  D: The primary goal of television executives is to maximize the purchasing power of the people who watch television shows, as TV shows make their profits from sponsors. This serves to explain the difference between the primary goals of movie and TV executives.
  E: The fact that over half of the most popular TV shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch is not enough to explain the primary goal difference between movie and TV executives.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Question: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The museum displays only twentieth-century works that are on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
- The museum store sells prints of both the museum's permanent collection and some works that are not part of it, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
- The prompt does not provide information to support any of the answer choices.
- Therefore, we need to determine which statement must be true if the curator's statements are true.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation:
- If all the works displayed by the museum are from the twentieth century and the prints sold in the store are all of twentieth-century works, then every print sold in the museum store must be a copy of a twentieth-century work, making choice B true.
- Choices A, C, D, and E are not necessarily true based on the given information.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or part of the museum's permanent collection.
- Prints of all of the latter works (the museum's permanent collection) are available in the museum store.
- The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.

A: It is possible that prints from works that are not part of the museum are also sold in addition to those that are either on loan or part of the museum's permanent collection. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
B: The statement relates only to works sold in the museum store. It is not clear whether any prints outside the store may be available that are not copies of a twentieth-century work. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
C: We only know that prints of all of the museum's permanent collection works are available in the museum store, but nothing is mentioned about works on loan from private collectors. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
D: There is no information in the passage to support or reject this statement, so it cannot be true or false based on the passage. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
E: The passage does not give information about whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  The works displayed are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  Prints of all the museum's permanent collection works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: From the given statements, the only thing we can conclude with certainty is that every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. Choice A talks about "every print in the museum store" and that includes prints that are not sold in the museum store. Choice C makes a claim about all the works displayed in the museum, which is not necessarily true. Choice D is not consistent with the information given because Hopper's Nighthawks is not on loan from a private collector, but is rather "not part of the museum's permanent collection". Finally, choice E talks about Hopper's Nighthawks but has nothing to do with whether every print sold in the museum store is from a twentieth-century work.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The principles given state that a person who unknowingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if they could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. If he could not have reasonably foreseen it, then he should not be blamed for it.
B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, and if she could not have reasonably foreseen it, then she should not be blamed for it.
C: Gougon knew that serving the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, so he could be blamed for it if it does make them ill.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine and did not know that it would cause harm, so he could be blamed for it, but no one else could be blamed if they did not knowingly contribute to it.
E: Kapp could have reasonably foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire, so she should be blamed for starting the fire on Rodriguez's farm.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The principles mentioned in the passage state that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: The scenario in which Riley parks his car in the center lane of Main Street and causes a traffic accident may fit the principles mentioned if Riley could not have reasonably foreseen that parking in the center lane could lead to a traffic accident.
B: The scenario involving Oblicek suggesting a loan to her brother fits the principles mentioned if she had no idea that the suggestion could cause the business to go bankrupt and could not have reasonably foreseen this.
C: The scenario involving Gougon serving hollandaise sauce to his guests fits the principles mentioned if he could not have reasonably foreseen that it would make his guests ill.
D: The scenario involving Dr. Fitzpatrick giving the wrong medicine does not necessarily fit the principles mentioned since the passage talks about a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune.
E: The scenario involving Kapp starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm by dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves does not fit the principles mentioned since any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that a person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, it also notes that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune may not be to blame if they could not have reasonably foreseen it.
  A: Riley was aware of the risks of parking his car in the center lane, but he didn't fully think it through. Therefore, this option does not align with the principle that one should not be blamed if they could not reasonably have foreseen the misfortune.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting a loan would cause her brother's business to go bankrupt and could not have reasonably foreseen that it would. Based on the principles stated, Oblicek would not be to blame for the misfortune.
  C: Gougon was concerned that serving hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill but still served it, so he is not blameless in the situation. This option does not align with the principle that one should not be blamed if they could not reasonably have foreseen the misfortune.
  D: Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know the medication would cause the patient's blood pressure to increase, so he should not be blamed if no one else knowingly contributed to the misfortune.
  E: While Kapp may not have realized the risk of starting a fire by dropping the cigarette, it was still reasonable to foresee that dry leaves and fire do not mix. Therefore, Kapp could still be blamed for starting the fire.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The principles state that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune, and could not reasonably have foreseen it, is not to be blamed for it. 
  A: Riley parked his car in the center lane of Main Street without thinking; so no blame should be assigned.
  B: Oblicek suggested that her brother take out a loan without foreseeing that it could cause the business to go bankrupt, and this is not something she could have reasonably foreseen.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that he would make his guests ill and concerned about that notion, so the situation does not meet the principles discussed above.
  D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine and did not know the consequences, and no one besides Dr. Fitzpatrick knowingly contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, so only Dr. Fitzpatrick can be blamed.
  E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves where any reasonable person could have foreseen that it could cause a fire; thus, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The question describes a principle that states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  A: Riley knowingly parked his car in the center lane of Main Street, and it was not an unwitting action. So, this scenario does not apply to the principle stated.
  B: Oblicek did not knowingly suggest to her brother to take out a loan, so this scenario does apply to the principle stated.
  C: Gougon was concerned that the sauce might make his guests ill, so this scenario does not apply to the principle stated.
  D: Dr. Fitzpatrick knowingly gave the patient the wrong medicine, so this scenario does not apply to the principle stated.
  E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves knowing that it could start a fire. Thus, this scenario does not apply to the principle stated.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  A: The reasoning is similar to the principle, as Riley did not foresee the misfortune. Therefore, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: The reasoning is in line with the principle, as Oblicek did not reason that her suggestion might lead to bankruptcy, and she could not have foreseen it. Hence, she should not be blamed for the misfortune.
  C: The principle states that a person who had no reason to think that misfortune could happen cannot be blamed. However, it also says that the person should not be blamed if they could not reasonably have foreseen it. Hence, Gougon could be blamed because he knew that serving something might make his guest ill.
  D: The principle applies to Dr. Fitzpatrick's case because he did not know that giving the wrong medicine could cause an increase in blood pressure. Therefore, the principle justifies the reasoning.
  E: The principle states that a person who couldn't foresee the misfortune reasonably cannot be blamed. However, in this case, any rational person could foresee that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, the principle doesn't justify the reasoning presented. 
Action: Answer('B')
Response 6:
Knowledge: The question asks us to identify which scenario best aligns with the argument that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if they could not reasonably have foreseen it. In other words, if someone couldn't have predicted a negative outcome, they shouldn't be blamed for it.
A: Riley knew his car would likely cause an accident but didn't take action to prevent it. This scenario doesn't qualify for the argument because Riley knew the risks and could have prevented them
B: Oblicek had no way of anticipating the negative consequence and therefore cannot be blamed for it.
C: Gougon is aware that there is a risk of making his guests sick and should take responsibility if it happens.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave the wrong medicine and did not know it would cause increased blood pressure. He is not to blame since he couldn't have foreseen the negative result.
E: Kapp should have known that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Even though she didn't realize it, she is to blame because any reasonable person could have known it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The principle mentioned in the context is that a person should not be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it. 
A: Riley knew that parking a car in the center lane of a street would be dangerous, so he could have foreseen a traffic accident; thus he is blameworthy.
B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting for taking a loan to expand the business would be likely to cause the business to go bankrupt. She couldn't have reasonably foreseen it, so she is not blameworthy.
C: Gougon was concerned about serving the hollandaise sauce, so he could have foreseen that his guests could get ill. Thus, he is blameworthy.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick could not have known that the wrong medicine would cause greatly increased blood pressure, so he is not blameworthy.
E: Kapp could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire, so she is blameworthy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The question asks which option aligns with the principles mentioned above. According to the principles, a person should not be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: Riley knew he was parking his car in the center lane of Main Street which is against traffic laws. Thus, the principles mentioned above are not applicable to this statement.
B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting a loan could cause bankruptcy and she could not have reasonably foreseen it. The option aligns with the principles mentioned above.
C: Gougon was concerned that sauce might make his guests ill, which means, serving the sauce to them was a careless act. Thus, the principles mentioned above are not applicable to this statement.
D: Dr. Fitzpatrick made a mistake by giving the wrong medicine, which is an act of negligence. Thus, the principles mentioned above are not applicable to this statement.
E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves which is careless. Thus, the principles mentioned above are not applicable to this statement.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The principles described state that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
A: The person knowingly parked their car in a dangerous location, and if an accident happened, they would be responsible for the damages.
B: The person did not knowingly bring about misfortune, nor could they have predicted the outcome, and should not be blamed for it.
C: The person knowingly took a risk by serving potentially dangerous food, and if guests get sick, the person would be responsible for the damages.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that people with specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from juries, making trials unfair for disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  A: If it is less likely for jurors without specialized knowledge to comprehend the testimony, it strengthens the argument.
  B: If jurors with specialized knowledge are more likely to be prejudiced, it strengthens the argument.
  C: This option talks about appointing an impartial arbitrator, it is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: If experts tend to hedge their conclusions, it could weaken the argument because it indicates that their testimony may not be as decisive as previously thought.
  E: The cost of expert witnesses is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are systematically excluded. 
A: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that jurors may not be able to comprehend complicated issues without specialized knowledge.
B: This statement exacerbates the perceived issue by suggesting that people with specialized knowledge would be biased in favor of one party. 
C: This statement is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of inclusion or exclusion of jurors with specialized knowledge. 
D: This statement illustrates a cautious and responsible approach that experts take in their work, but it does not address the issue of exclusion of jurors.
E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument since it does not address the question of whether excluding people with specialized knowledge makes a jury trial unfair.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because such jurors are systematically excluded.
  A: This strengthens the argument by stating that non-specialist jurors are less likely to comprehend the testimony.
  B: This supports the argument by stating that specialized jurors are more likely to be biased.
  C: This is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries, so such trials are not fair.
  A: This strengthens the argument, because it suggests that jurors may not be able to understand complicated scientific or technical issues.
  B: This weakens the argument, because it suggests that having specialized knowledge may bias a juror, so excluding such people may actually result in a fairer trial.
  C: This is not relevant to the argument, since it suggests using a different method of dispute resolution.
  D: This is not relevant to the argument, since it discusses the testimony of experts, not the exclusion of jurors.
  E: This is not relevant to the argument, since it discusses the cost of expert witnesses, not the exclusion of jurors.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that trial by jury is not fair because jurors without specialized knowledge on scientific or technical issues are excluded from trials where that issue is relevant. 
A: This statement supports the argument that jurors without specialized knowledge are not capable of comprehending testimony and therefore have no place in the jury, which strengthens the argument.
B: This statement claims that knowledge on a scientific or technical issue leads to prejudice in favor of one party, which suggests that such jurors might not be as impartial as presumed and thus supports the argument.
C: This statement talks about arbitration, which is not relevant to the argument regarding the impartiality of jury trials. Therefore, it does not weaken nor strengthen the argument.
D: This statement weakens the argument because it shows that expert witnesses account for the possibility of errors, which accounts for the likelihood that their conclusion is not definite.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument and, therefore, does not weaken nor strengthen it. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The argument suggests that when a trial involves scientific or technical issues, people without specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from juries and therefore, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving those issues.
A: This choice provides information that supports the argument by suggesting that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony. Therefore, it does not weaken the argument.
B: This choice provides information suggesting that the more a juror knows about a scientific or technical issue, the more likely they are to be biased in favor of a party in the lawsuit. This supports the argument that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues. Therefore, it does not weaken the argument.
C: This choice suggests appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues. This choice presents an alternative solution that may be flawed. It is not relevant to whether trial by jury is a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues. Therefore, this choice does not weaken the argument.
D: This choice suggests that experts hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error. This might weaken the argument by suggesting that jurors without specialized knowledge can still assess the testimony of expert witnesses even if they cannot fully comprehend the technical details provided in the testimony. This could indicate that the trial by jury is a fair means of settling disputes even in the presence of highly technical issues.
E: This choice provides information that is not relevant to whether trial by jury is a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues. Therefore it does not weaken the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that when a scientific or technical issue is involved in a trial, people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries, making the trial by jury an unfair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
  
  A: This answer choice agrees with the argument that jurors without specialized knowledge cannot comprehend the testimony being given in complicated issues. Therefore, this answer choice does not weaken the argument.
  
  B: This answer choice supports the idea that people with specialized knowledge have biases. Even though this may weaken the argument that specialized people should be included in trials, it doesn't counter the argument that a trial by jury is unfair when it comes to scientific or technical issues. Therefore, this answer choice does not weaken the argument.
  
  C: This answer choice argues that appointing an arbitrator is also not a fair means of settling disputes. This is irrelevant to the argument being made, and it doesn't counter the argument that a trial by jury is unfair when it comes to scientific or technical issues. Therefore, this answer choice does not weaken the argument.
  
  D: This answer choice doesn't counter the argument, but it does provide additional information on how experts testify, which is irrelevant to the argument being made. Therefore, this answer choice does not weaken the argument.
  
  E: This answer choice can weaken the argument because it shows that not everyone who is involved in litigation can afford expert witnesses, which means that not all parties are automatically disadvantaged because they do not have specialized knowledge. Therefore, this answer choice is the best answer.
  
Action: Answer("E")

C: Does not address the issue of jurors with specialized knowledge and instead discusses the impartiality of an arbitrator. 

D: Does not weaken or strengthen the argument. 

E: Is not relevant to the argument. 

Action: Answer("B") as it further strengthens the argument and goes against the idea of using jurors with specialized knowledge.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people who have specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant.
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given. This strengthens the argument.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins. This also strengthens the argument.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues. This is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error. This is irrelevant to the argument.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services. This weakens the argument, because if many people cannot afford the services of expert witnesses, then there is a higher probability of people without specialized knowledge being in the jury.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The geologist's argument is that the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence of biomarkers.

A: This statement is not useful as it doesn't address the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
B: This statement, if true, is interesting but it doesn't weaken the geologist's argument.
C: This statement actually supports the geologist's argument as it suggests that petroleum could not have been formed rapidly.
D: This statement doesn't refute the geologist's argument, as it doesn't address the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
E: This statement weakens the geologist's argument because it supports the dominant view of petroleum formation from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers refutes the view that petroleum is formed from deep carbon deposits because biomarkers indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  A: If fossils are discovered that are devoid of biomarkers, it would weaken the argument that biomarkers indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  B: The emergence of living organisms is not directly relevant to the argument regarding the source of petroleum.
  C: The period of time it takes for organisms to become petroleum is not directly relevant to the argument regarding the source of petroleum.
  D: The argument regarding the source of petroleum is that it's not from the deep carbon deposits, and certain strains of bacteria thriving deep inside the earth's crust wouldn't refute that argument.
  E: The argument that petroleum is not from the fossilized remains of plants and animals and instead from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth is directly contradicted by the alternative explanation that carbon deposits are formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust based on the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
- Some scientists argue that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
- To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that supports the theory that petroleum did not come from fossilized remains.
- Irrelevant choices are:
    - B: Living organisms only emerged after the earth's formation is irrelevant to the argument.
    - D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust is irrelevant to the argument.
- Choices A, C, and E potentially contribute to the argument.
    - A: If fossils are devoid of biomarkers, it means that biomarkers are not necessarily a good indicator of past life forms, which weakens the argument that petroleum comes from fossilized remains.
    - C: If it takes many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum, the theory of deep carbon deposits is more plausible.
    - E: If some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, it means that not all carbon deposits came from organisms, therefore, it weakens the argument that petroleum always comes from the fossilized remains of organisms.
- Choice A is the best option because if fossils are devoid of biomarkers, the argument that petroleum comes from fossilized remains is weakened.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers.
  A: This choice does not address the geologist's argument.
  B: This choice does not address the geologist's argument.
  C: This choice does not weaken the geologist's argument. In fact, it supports it.
  D: If certain strains of bacteria can exist deep inside the earth's crust, then it is possible that these bacteria could have formed the petroleum. This weakens the geologist's argument.
  E: This choice does not weaken the geologist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The geologist argues that the presence in petroleum of biomarkers shows that it was formed from the fossilized remains of living organisms. Scientists who believe that petroleum was formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth challenged this view.
A: This option suggests that some fossils do not have biomarkers. This might weaken the argument that biomarkers indicate a living organism, but does not refute the argument that petroleum was formed from the fossilized remains of living organisms. Hence, this option is not correct.
B: This option is not relevant, as the argument is not about the emergence of living organisms.
C: This option supports the geologist's argument. It reinforces that it could take millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
D:  This option is not relevant, as it does not affect the geologist's argument.
E: This option suggests that carbon deposits could have been formed from the fossilized remains of plants. This implies that petroleum could have been formed not only from fossilized remains of animals but also from that of plants. It weakens the argument that petroleum was formed only from the fossilized remains of animals. Hence, this is the correct option.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum implies a connection to living organisms, while the opposing theory posits that petroleum forms from deep carbon deposits that have nothing to do with living organisms. We are asked to find the answer choice that most weakens the geologist's argument.

A: This statement weakens the opposing theory by showing that non-biological fossils exist. However, it does not address the geologist's argument, which is based on the presence of biomarkers.
B: This statement is irrelevant, as it does not address either theory or the geologist's argument.
C: This statement supports the opposing theory and does not weaken the geologist's argument.
D: This statement supports the opposing theory by implying that some petroleum is not connected to living organisms. However, it does not definitively disprove the existence of biomarkers in petroleum.
E: This statement weakens the opposing theory by suggesting that some carbon deposits are connected to living organisms. If these carbon deposits can turn into petroleum, then it suggests that there could be a biological connection to petroleum.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The geologist believes that petroleum is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust.
  This view has been challenged, but the challenger's theory does not explain the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  The question is asking for something that weakens the geologist's argument.
  
A: This statement does not directly impact the argument of the geologist about the presence of biomarkers and is actually in line with the geologist's argument.
B: This statement is true, but it does not affect the argument of either the geologist or the challenger in relation to how petroleum is formed.
C: This statement actually supports the geologist's argument that petroleum comes from the remains of living organisms.
D: This might be a valid statement about bacteria, but again, it does not impact the argument about biomarkers in petroleum.
E: If this statement is true, it provides support for the challenger's view that petroleum does not always come from living organisms. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
Geologists believe that the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust are the dominant source of petroleum, while some scientists claim that petroleum was formed from deep carbon deposits.
The geologist argues that biomarkers found in petroleum refute the claims of these scientists.

A: This suggests that it is possible for fossils to not have biomarkers. It doesn't address the presence of biomarkers in petroleum that support the geologist's argument, so it doesn't weaken the argument.
B: This statement doesn't impact the argument as it discusses the emergence of living organisms, not the formation of petroleum.
C: This supports the geologist's argument that it would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum, so it doesn't weaken the argument.
D: This statement doesn't address the source of petroleum, so it doesn't help weaken or strengthen the geologist's argument.
E: This provides an alternative source of carbon that could potentially have been used to form petroleum. If it is true, this would weaken the geologist's argument. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argued that the theory of petroleum formation from deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  A: This weakens the geologist's argument that biomarkers are a necessary condition for petroleum formation, but it does not affect the argument that petroleum is formed from the remains of living organisms.
  B: This statement, even if true, doesn't directly address the argument about the formation of petroleum.
  C: This statement supports the idea that petroleum is formed from the remains of living organisms, because it indicates that the process would take a long time.
  D: This statement does not address the argument about the formation of petroleum.
  E: This statement weakens the argument that petroleum is formed from deep carbon deposits, because it suggests that some deposits could be formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
- The geologist's argument is that the biomarkers in petroleum indicate that it is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
- Weakining the argument means providing evidence that challenges this conclusion.
- A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
- B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument.
- C: This statement actually supports the geologist's argument.
- D: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms; thus, they are immune to it. The argument is flawed because exposure to a microbe does not mean immunity to it, and many people who are infected with staphylococcus develop harmful symptoms.
A: The argument is about the relationship between morally right actions and actions that serve the interests of everyone; there is no clear similarity with the student's argument.
B: The argument is about advertisers' and writers' intentions to make certain claims; there is no clear similarity with the student's argument.
C: The argument is about Isabel saying she will take medication but is still unwell; there is no clear similarity with the student's argument.
D: The argument is about excessive taxation and business expansions; there is no clear similarity with the student's argument.
E: The argument is about the frequency of hand washing by doctors and its effectiveness in preventing diseases; there is no clear similarity with the student's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
The student's argument is based on a claim that exposure to staphylococcus does not cause any harmful symptoms in humans and therefore they must have immunity. The argument is based on a flawed pattern of reasoning. It is most similar to the following flawed pattern of reasoning:
Knowledge:
A: The argument presents a conclusion that some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone, without providing supporting evidence.
B: The argument presents a conclusion that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, without providing supporting evidence.
C: The argument presents a conclusion that Isabel did not take the medication because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, without providing supporting evidence.
D: The argument presents a conclusion that excessive taxation is the cause of the recent decline in business expansions, without providing supporting evidence.
E: The argument presents a conclusion that the procedure of hand washing cannot prevent diseases because doctors tend to wash their hands less often, without providing supporting evidence.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presented by the student assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms implies the presence of immunity to infection.
  A: This argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning that something necessary for an event to occur is also sufficient for the event to occur.
  B: This argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning that two groups that are different will not share a particular characteristic.
  C: This argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning that one event or thing is directly caused by another event or thing when this is not fully supported.
  D: This argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning that failing to occur under one set of circumstances implies that it will not occur under any other circumstances.
  E: This argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning that the effectiveness of a procedure can be inferred from the behavior of individuals who do not use it effectively.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument from the student suggests that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. 
A: The argument in option A is about two concepts being conflated: morality and what is in the interests of everyone.
B: The argument in option B is an analogy that says since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true. They are two unrelated concepts.
C: The argument in option C is a non-sequitur that concludes Isabel did not take the medication because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill. It is possible that the medication Isabel took did not cure her disease or alleviate its symptoms.
D: The argument in option D draws a cause-and-effect relationship between excessive taxation and less business expansion. The absence of business expansion is not necessarily correlated with the high taxation.
E: The argument in option E is a hasty generalization that says doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. It concludes that hand washing is not valuable in preventing disease in health care environments. However, this conclusion is not valid because other factors might influence the result observed.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The student's argument is that since people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. However, the conclusion is not valid because there are other possible reasons why people do not develop harmful symptoms when exposed to staphylococcus.
A: This argument involves confusing two types of moral consideration, and is therefore different from the student's argument.
B: This argument involves contrasting the actions of advertisers and writers of fiction, and is therefore different from the student's argument.
C: This argument involves assuming that a statement about what Isabel said implies that Isabel is still ill, and is therefore different from the student's argument.
D: This argument involves assuming a causal relationship between taxation and business expansion, and is therefore different from the student's argument.
E: This argument involves assuming that doctors are the only health care professionals who should wash their hands, and is therefore different from the student's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The student argues that because many people are not affected by staphylococcus, they must have immunity to this microorganism. However, this argument is flawed because some people may be affected by staphylococcus, but show no symptoms. Hence, it cannot be concluded that every person who does not show symptoms is immune to staphylococcus.
A: The argument here is that some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone, which is not similar to the argument made by the student.
B: The argument here assumes that writers of fiction are not advertisers, which is not similar to the argument made by the student.
C: The argument here states that Isabel did not take the medication as she is still ill, but the evidence given is not sufficient to support this conclusion, which is similar to the flawed reasoning used by the student.
D: The argument here assumes that excessive taxation has led to a decline in business expansion, but does not consider alternative reasons for this decline. This is not similar to the argument made by the student.
E: The argument here suggests that doctors wash their hands less often than other healthcare professionals, which is not sufficient to conclude that hand-washing is of no value in preventing disease. It is not similar to the argument made by the student.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The student assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without harmful symptoms necessarily implies immunity to infection by this microorganism, without considering other factors that could contribute to the lack of symptoms or whether there are strains of staphylococcus to which the person may not be immune. 
  A: This argument commits the fallacy of equivocation, so it is dissimilar to the student's flawed pattern of reasoning.
  B: This argument involves a generalization based on an irrelevant comparison, so it is dissimilar to the student's flawed pattern of reasoning.
  C: This argument involves a weak analogy, so it is dissimilar to the student's flawed pattern of reasoning.
  D: This argument confuses correlation with causation, so it is dissimilar to the student's flawed pattern of reasoning.
  E: This argument involves a fallacious generalization based on an unrepresentative sample, so it is similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to the student's argument.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The student is assuming that just because many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it omits alternative explanations for why those people did not develop symptoms.
A: The argument is not about morality.
B: The argument is not about persuasion or advertising.
C: This argument assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates symptoms, which is not true.
D: The argument is about business taxation, not about medical immunity.
E: The argument draws an unwarranted conclusion based on the premise that doctors do not wash their hands often.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The student's argument is that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it is based on an assumption that is not necessarily true. For example, some people who are exposed to staphylococcus may not develop symptoms because their immune system was able to fight off the infection, not because they have an immunity to it.
  A: This argument is flawed because it equivocates between two different meanings of "serve the interests of everyone."
  B: This argument is flawed because it assumes that fiction writers never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: This argument is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
  D: This argument is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, when there may be other factors at play.
  E: This argument is flawed because it assumes that doctors not washing their hands as often as other health care professionals means that handwashing is not effective in preventing disease.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The student attempts to make a causal claim that is not necessarily supported by the facts presented. It assumes that all people who are exposed to staphylococcus but do not develop harmful symptoms have an immunity to the microorganism, which is not necessarily true.
  A: This argument involves a premise that suggests that everything morally right is just, but its conclusion denies that some morally right actions serve the interests of everyone.
  B: This argument involves a premise that claims advertisers try to persuade people, and then concludes that fiction writers never try to persuade anybody, which is not necessarily true.
  C: This argument involves a premise that medication either cures a disease or alleviates its symptoms, and then concludes that Isabel didn't take the medicine because she is still quite ill, which is not conclusive evidence.
  D: This argument involves a premise that high taxation discourages business and then concludes that the recent decline in business expansions is due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
  E: This argument involves a premise that doctors wash their hands less often than any other professionals, and then concludes that the procedure cannot be useful in preventing disease, which is not necessarily true.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book, claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects, does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects, because the physician who criticized the book is employed by the company that manufactures that drug and hence has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
  A: This may be a valid criticism of the book itself, but it does not directly address the reasoning in the journalist's argument.
  B: This is a potential criticism of the journalist's argument because the argument assumes that the physician is not capable of fairly weighing the evidence concerning the drug's side effects.
  C: This is not a valid criticism of the journalist's argument because the argument does not address the author's potential biases for or against the claims made in the book.
  D: This is a potential criticism of the journalist's argument since the argument assumes that the physician's critique of the book is biased and lacks legitimacy due to the physician's association with the company that manufactures the drug.
  E: This may be a valid criticism of the book or the journalist's argument, but it does not directly address the reasoning in the journalist's argument.

A: This choice is not a specific criticism of the journalist's argument.
B: This choice is a criticism of the journalist's argument because it assumes that the physician's affiliation with the drug manufacturer renders him incapable of fairly evaluating the drug's side effects, which may not necessarily be the case.
C: This choice is not a specific criticism of the journalist's argument.
D: This choice is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument, as it suggests that the physician's critique may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for rejecting the book's claims even if the physician has personal reasons to deny the claims. 
E: This choice is not a specific criticism of the journalist's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist is claiming that the critique by the physician does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects based on the fact that the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
A: This choice is not a criticism of the journalist's argument, but a possible limitation of the critique in the book.
B: This choice may be a criticism of the journalist's argument, as the argument is based on the assumption that personal interest is influencing the physician's critique, which may not always be the case.
C: This choice is not a criticism of the journalist's argument, but a possible limitation of the author of the book.
D: This choice may be a criticism of the journalist's argument, suggesting that the physician's critique may still be legitimate despite having personal reasons to deny the drug's dangerous side effects.
E: This choice is not a criticism of the journalist's argument, but a possible explanation for why a critique may not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist's argument claims that the physician's critique of the book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects should not be taken seriously because the physician has personal reasons to deny the drug is dangerous, being employed by the company that manufactures the drug.

A: This choice is not directly relevant to the journalist's argument.
B: This choice is a potential criticism of the journalist's argument - the argument assumes that anyone associated with the company that manufactures the drug is biased, and therefore provides a weak argument for rejecting the physician's critique.
C: This choice is a potential counter-argument to the journalist's position, but it is not a criticism of the argument itself.
D: This choice is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument - it is plausible that someone may have personal reasons to deny a claim but nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim, which would make the journalist's argument weak.
E: This choice is a potential counter-argument to the journalist's position, but it is not a criticism of the argument itself.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The journalist claims that the physician's critique is invalid due to a conflict of interest, but this reasoning could be vulnerable to criticism.
A: This choice does not criticize the journalist's reasoning, it is irrelevant to the argument.
B: This choice is related to the journalist's reasoning that the physician is biased, but it is not a criticism of it.
C: This choice presents an alternative explanation for why the book claims that the drug has dangerous side effects, but it is not a criticism of the journalist's argument.
D: This choice criticizes the journalist's argument because it points out that the physician's critique may still be valid despite the conflict of interest.
E: This choice presents an alternative explanation for why the book's claim may still be valid despite the critique, but it is not a criticism of the journalist's argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The journalist argues that a critique of a book claiming the new drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects, as the physician who criticized the book has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
A: This option presents a different possibility of the critique of the book, it does not address the journalist's argument.
B: This is a plausible criticism of the journalist's argument as it assumes that anyone associated with a company is unable to weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug, which could weaken the journalist's argument.
C: This option presents an alternative possibility of bias, it does not address the journalist's argument.
D: This option raises the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim, which supports the journalist's argument.
E: This option presents a different possibility for the source of the failure to provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims, it does not address the journalist's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:

The journalist argues that the physician's criticism of a book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, hence, probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.

A: This is not a criticism of the journalist's reasoning in the argument.
B: This statement is a criticism of the argument because it assumes that the physician's employment by the company renders him incapable of fairly evaluating evidence about the drug's safety.
C: This statement is not a criticism of the reasoning in the journalist's argument.
D: This statement is a possible criticism of the journalist's reasoning because the argument assumes that the physician's critique is biased without considering the possibility that it may provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
E: This statement is not a criticism of the reasoning in the journalist's argument. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The journalist argues that a physician employed by the same company that manufactures the drug criticized a book that claims the drug has dangerous side effects, and since the physician has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous, the critique doesn't provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims.
A: This is not relevant because the argument is about the critique of the book's claim that the drug has dangerous side effects and not other claims in the book.
B: This is the correct answer since the journalist assumes that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug, which is a hasty and unwarranted generalization.
C: This is not relevant because the author's potential bias does not affect the validity of the physician's critique.
D: This is not relevant because the journalist argues that the physician's critique does not provide legitimate grounds, regardless of whether he has personal reasons to deny the claim.
E: This is not relevant because the argument is not about why the critique doesn't provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The question presents an apparent conflict between two statements. The first one says that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was crucial for the evolution of the modern human brain and that those resources were abundant in shore environments. The second one states that the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  A: This answer choice talks about the difference between the metabolic rate of early humans and anatomically modern humans, but it does not resolve the conflict presented in the question.
  B: This answer choice provides information about the difference between the size of the brains of the earliest known humans and the anatomically modern human brain. However, it does not resolve the conflict presented in the question.
  C: This answer choice claims that prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more abundant and reliable resources than they do today. However, it does not provide information about shore environments, and it does not resolve the conflict presented in the question.
  D: This answer choice talks about the techniques used to explore prehistoric shore sites. However, it does not resolve the conflict presented in the question.
  E: This answer choice presents the possibility that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. This information could help to resolve the apparent conflict presented in the question because it would explain why the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas despite the fact that shore environments offered the necessary resources. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The statement explains that high calorie diets with adequate fats were crucial for the development of the human brain. These resources were found in shore environments, but the brain's evolution occurred in savanna and woodland areas.
A: Comparing the metabolic rates of early humans to modern humans does not help in resolving the conflict between the shore environment and the savanna and woodland environments as the statement does not suggest a difference in metabolic rates between early and modern humans.
B: While it might be a useful point of data, comparing the brain size of early humans to modern humans does not explain the apparent conflict between the shore environment and the savanna and woodland environments.
C: This statement would not resolve the apparent conflict presented above.
D: While it suggests that more information could be learned, it does not resolve the apparent conflict that high calorie diets were found in shoreline environments yet the brain's evolution occurred in savanna and woodland areas.
E: This statement would help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above because it suggests that gathering food in the shore environment required more calories than gathering food in the savanna and woodland areas, which would explain the evolution of the human brain occurring in the less calorie-rich savanna and woodland environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The evolution of the anatomically modern human brain was aided by a high-calorie diet that could be obtained in shore environments, where reliable resources were available to early humans. The human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  A: This statement is not directly relevant to the apparent conflict that needs resolving. 
  B: This statement is also not directly relevant to the apparent conflict that needs resolving.
  C: This statement contradicts the apparent conflict presented in the context.
  D: This statement does not provide direct help to resolve the apparent conflict.
  E: This statement offers a possible explanation of why the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain occurred in savanna and woodland areas, despite the abundance of food resources in shore environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The evolution of anatomically modern human brains required a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats.
  Early human ancestors found such resources most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
  The human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas.
A: This choice does not provide any new information to resolve the apparent conflict presented in the question.
B: The brain size does not resolve the conflict between the abundance of food resources in shore environments and the evolution of human brains in savanna and woodland areas.
C: This choice does not resolve the apparent conflict presented in the question.
D: This choice does not provide any new information to resolve the apparent conflict presented in the question.
E: This choice resolves the conflict by stating that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in savanna and woodland areas. Therefore, it is more likely that early humans evolved their brains while living in savanna and woodland areas where gathering food required less energy.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The human brain's evolution began among our early human ancestors and required a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats. Such food resources were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments. However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  
A: This choice provides information about the metabolic rate of early humans and their efficiency to expend their fat reserves. However, it does not explain the conflict.
B: This choice provides information about the size of the brains of the earliest known humans in comparison to the anatomically modern human brain. However, it does not explain the conflict.
C: This choice provides information about the resources offered by prehistoric savanna and woodland areas. However, it does not explain the conflict.
D: This choice provides information about the techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites. However, it does not explain the conflict.
E: If gathering food in shore environments requires a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments, this explains why the human brain evolved to prefer food resources that were abundant and reliable. The shore environments favored food that provided the type of nutrition needed for brain development, and early humans expended more calories to obtain it. Despite being reliable and abundant, these resources required greater effort to obtain. This resolved the apparent conflict in the passage.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about how an adequate high-calorie diet was crucial for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain which began among our early human ancestors. Such resources were most abundant and reliable in shore environments. However, human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
A: This statement talks about the metabolic rate of early humans. However, it doesn't seem to contribute to the resolution of the conflict presented in the passage.
B: This statement presents a comparison between the earliest known human brain with the anatomically modern one. However, it doesn't seem to contribute to the resolution of the conflict presented in the passage.
C: This statement talks about the reliability of resources available in prehistoric savanna and woodland areas. While it could explain why human evolution occurred in savannas rather than on the shore, it doesn't seem directly relevant to the resolution of the apparent conflict presented in the passage.
D: This statement talks about the techniques used to explore the archaeology of the prehistoric shore sites. While interesting information, it doesn't seem to contribute to the resolution of the conflict presented in the passage.
E: This statement seems to explain why the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas rather than on the shore environments. The passage suggests that shore environments provided abundant and reliable resources, but this statement suggests that it required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by the early humans to gather food in those environments, making savanna and woodland areas more attractive for brain development.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The evolution of the anatomically modern human brain required a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats, which was most abundant and reliable in shore environments. However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
A: This choice is discussing a lower metabolic rate of early humans, which is not relevant to resolving the conflict between the evolution of the human brain and the availability of food resources.
B: If the brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modern human brain, it would explain why those humans did not require as much food as humans with anatomically modern brains and why the conflict exists. Therefore, this choice is potentially helpful in resolving the conflict presented.
C: This is a statement that contradicts the known facts presented. According to the context, the food resources were most abundant and reliable in shore environments, and it was easier to obtain such food than in savanna and woodland areas.
D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have no bearing on the conflict presented here.
E: This choice explains the higher demand for energy for gathering food in shore environments. However, it does not resolve the apparent conflict between the evolution of the human brain and the availability of food resources in different environments.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
The argument presents a conflict between the fact that a diet providing adequate fats was crucial for the evolution of the human brain, a diet that was most abundant and reliable in shoreline environments available to early humans, yet the evolution of the human brain almost exclusively took place in savanna and woodland areas.
A: The metabolic rate of early humans is irrelevant to the apparent conflict presented above.
B: The size of the earliest known human brains is irrelevant in resolving the apparent conflict presented above.
C: This option sounds like it could help to resolve the apparent conflict, but it modifies the wrong premise. The conflict is between the abundance of fatty diet and the non-shoreline areas where the evolution of the brain took place, not on the reliability and affinity of resources in these regions.
D: The techniques used to explore prehistoric shore sites do not help to solve the apparent conflict presented above.
E: This option sounds like it could help to resolve the apparent conflict. If gathering food in shoreline environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in savanna and woodland areas, therefore, the shoreline environments would not have provided enough food to support a high-calorie diet that could help evolution the human brain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The question presents a conflict between two facts:
  - Anatomically modern human brains evolved in savanna and woodland areas.
  - A high-calorie diet with adequate fats was most abundant and reliable in shore environments available to early humans.
  A: This option discusses metabolic rates instead of food resources or environments and does not help to resolve the conflict.
  B: This option provides additional information on the size of brain and does not help to resolve the conflict.
  C: This option provides information about the reliability and abundance of resources in prehistoric times but does not help to resolve the conflict.
  D: This option discusses the techniques used to explore archaeology and is not relevant to resolving the conflict mentioned in the question.
  E: This option explains the activities of early humans in shore environments and may help to explain the conflict.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
   The prompt asserts that the early human brain evolved due to access to nutrient-dense food provided by shore environments. However, the evolution of the human brain took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.

A: This answer choice addresses the metabolic rates of early humans, which has no direct relevance to the conflict presented in the prompt.
B: This answer choice describes the size difference between the earliest humans and anatomically modern humans, which has no direct relevance to the conflict presented in the prompt.
C: This answer choice describes the ecological resources of prehistoric savanna and woodland areas, which can help to clarify why the human brain evolved in savanna and woodland environments instead of the shore where there is an abundance of nutrient-dense food sources.
D: This answer choice describes an aspect of archaeological exploration and has no reference to the prompt's contentions.
E: This answer choice describes the cost of gathering food, which has no direct relevance to the conflict presented in the prompt.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study shows that office workers reporting the least control over their work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control, among those who do similar amounts of typing.
  A: This answer choice is discussing the relation between the amount of typing and the level of control over one's work. However, it doesn't provide an explanation for the study's findings.
  B: This answer choice is discussing the link between stress and nerve disorders. Although it may be true, it doesn't provide an explanation for the study's findings.
  C: This answer choice suggests that keyboards on which office workers type promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, it doesn't explain why workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control, among those who do similar amounts of typing.
  D: This answer choice is discussing the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome among office workers who rarely use keyboards, which is not relevant to the findings of the study.
  E: This answer choice is introducing another type of repetitive motion that office workers perform, besides typing. It suggests that these other motions may be more common among office workers reporting the most control over their work. Therefore, it may help to explain the study's findings because it shows that the level of control over one's work may affect the type of repetitive motions that workers perform and, thus, may affect their risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The study shows that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control. The cause of this situation is unknown.
A: This statement does not help explain the study's findings, as it is talking about the amount of typing done by different groups and not the relationship between control over one's work and developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
B: This statement suggests a possible explanation for the study's findings, as it implies that the emotional stress caused by a lack of control over one's own work may lead to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. 
C: This statement mentions a possible cause of the carpal tunnel syndrome but not the relationship between control over one's own work and the syndrome.
D: This statement talks about the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome among office workers who rarely use keyboards, which is irrelevant to the study's findings about office workers who do a lot of typing.
E: This statement is also irrelevant to the study's findings about office workers who do a lot of typing. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Carpal tunnel syndrome is a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists and it is caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard.
- A recent study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.

A: This choice does not help explain the study's findings, because the study only compared workers who do similar amounts of typing.
B: This choice suggests a possible explanation for the findings, but it does not directly help explain the study's findings.
C: This choice provides a possible cause of carpal tunnel syndrome but does not help explain the study's findings, as the study already identified typing as a cause of carpal tunnel syndrome.
D: This choice is not relevant to the study's findings because it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards, while the study looks at workers who do similar amounts of typing.
E: This choice provides a possible alternative explanation for the study's findings, suggesting that office workers with the most control over their own work tend to perform different repetitive motions than typing.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that, among office workers who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Choices:
  A: This answer choice provides information regarding the amount of typing done by workers who have the most control over their own work, but it does not help to explain the study's findings about carpal tunnel syndrome.
  B: This answer choice provides a reason why workers feeling a lack of control over their own work may be more susceptible to nerve disorders, but it does not directly relate to the study's findings about carpal tunnel syndrome.
  C: This answer choice provides information about the position of workers' arms and hands while typing, but it does not help explain the study's findings regarding control over one's own work and carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This answer choice suggests that the study's findings may also apply to office workers who rarely use keyboards. However, it does not specifically relate to the study's findings about control over work and carpal tunnel syndrome in office workers who type frequently.
  E: This answer choice suggests that workers with the most control over their own work may perform repetitive motions that can cause nerve disorders other than typing. It does not specifically relate to the study's findings about control over one's work and carpal tunnel syndrome related to typing.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that office workers who report least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported most control over their own work.
  The study relates carpal tunnel syndrome to repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard.
A: This answer choice could explain differences in the amount of carpal tunnel syndrome developed by office workers, but it doesn't elaborate on the relationship between control over work and the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
B: This answer choice could provide a potential explanation for the relationship among carpal tunnel syndrome, typing, and control, but it is not directly related to the study findings.
C: This is a partial explanation for the study's findings and could help to support them in part. However, it does not fully account for the study's focus on control over work and carpal tunnel syndrome.
D: This answer choice contradicts the given information that carpal tunnel syndrome is linked to repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. It also does not address the study findings related to control over work.
E: This answer choice does not address carpal tunnel syndrome specifically, but it is related to the idea that other factors besides typing may be affecting the study findings.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The study found that among office workers who do similar amounts of typing, those who have the least control over their work had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome compared to those who have the most control over their work.
A: This option suggests that office workers who have the most control tend to do significantly less typing, which may suggest that they have a lower risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. This contrasts with the study's findings that suggest that it is the level of control over one's work, rather than the amount of typing itself that affects the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.
B: This option suggests that workers who feel a lack of control over their work are more susceptible to nerve disorders. While this information may be useful, it does not explain why the study found that workers who have the most control over their work have a lower risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
C: This option suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type may be a common factor that promotes the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. While this information may be useful, it does not fully explain why the study found that workers who have the most control over their work have a lower risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
D: This option does not help to explain the study's finding as it does not discuss the relationship between control over work and carpal tunnel syndrome among office workers who use keyboards.
E: This option is similar to option A, but with a different type of repetitive motion. This still suggests that the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome may depend on the type of motions and work control, rather than the amount of typing itself.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  
A: This choice suggests that workers with the most control over their own work type less, but it does not provide any explanation for the relationship between work control and carpal tunnel syndrome. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated. 
B: This choice suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress and makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This provides a possible explanation for the study's findings. 
C: This choice suggests that keyboards on which office workers type promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This information, while possibly useful, does not contribute to explaining the study's findings directly.
D: This choice provides a piece of information which seems irrelevant to the study. 
E: This choice suggests that workers with the most control over their own work perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This information, while possibly useful, does not contribute to explaining the study's findings directly.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  1. Repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard can cause Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
  2. A recent study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome compared to those who reported the most control.
Choices:
  A: This choice does not explain the relationship between work control and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
  B: This choice gives a possible explanation of why workers with the least control are more likely to develop CTS. However, this choice does not support the relationship between work control and CTS.
  C: This choice talks about a possible explanation of how typing on a keyboard can cause CTS but does not explain the relationship between work control and the risk of developing CTS.
  D: This choice does not support the relationship between work control and the rate of developing CTS based on the use of keyboards.
  E: This choice provides a possible explanation of why office workers with the most control are less likely to develop CTS. By performing other types of repetitive motion at work, they tend to give their hands more rest from typing, which minimizes the chance of developing CTS.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  A: This option suggests a difference in typing amount between office workers with the most control and workers with the least control. However, the stimulus states that the study was conducted among office workers who do similar amounts of typing. Therefore, this option doesn't help explain the study's findings.
  B: This option suggests a relationship between a lack of control over one's work and a higher susceptibility to nerve disorders due to the emotional stress. This explanation helps to justify the study's findings because it indicates that the stress caused by lack of control could be a reason for the higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome among the workers with the least control. 
  C: This option doesn't address the issue of control over one's work and how it relates to carpal tunnel syndrome, instead, it raises a question about keyboard design. Therefore, this option is not relevant to the question.
  D: This option talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards, and it is different from the group examined in the study. Therefore, this option does not help explain the study's findings.
  E: This option suggests that office workers who have the most control over their work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their work, which could suggest that this is one of the reasons for the study findings. Workers with more control over their work are less likely to perform repetitive motions other than typing that could cause carpal tunnel syndrome. Therefore, this explanation helps to justify the study's findings. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that among office workers who do similar amounts of typing, those who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  A: This statement is about the amount of typing workers with different levels of control perform. 
  B: This statement connects lack of control over one's own work with emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: This statement is about the role of the keyboards on which typing is done in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This statement is unrelated since it is about office workers who rarely use keyboards.
  E: This statement is about the presence of other repetitive motions among office workers who have the most and least control over their own work.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above?
Choices:
  A: The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available.
  B: The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low.
  C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
  E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  An antidote for chickenpox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  The drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chickenpox.
A: The expense and accessibility of the drug does not help to reconcile the apparent discrepancy.
  B: Low patient compliance does not help to reconcile the apparent discrepancy. 
C: This alternative explains that the drug does not prevent the spread of chickenpox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person. So, the drug's use could still lead to the spread of the disease that would have been prevented by usual methods. This helps to reconcile the discrepancy indicated above.
D: If there were serious side effects caused by the drug, then this could have helped reconcile the discrepancy. However, the stem states the drug has no serious side-effects, so this choice is not valid.
E: If the drug caused the development of deadlier forms of chickenpox, then this could have helped reconcile the discrepancy. However, the stem does not indicate that this is the case, so this choice is not valid. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The statement points out that there is a discrepancy between the fact that the antidote is effective and has no serious side effects, but still could be dangerous for widespread use. The question asks to reconcile this apparent discrepancy.

A: This answer is irrelevant to the discrepancy. The drug being expensive and difficult to make available does not explain why its use could be dangerous.

B: This answer is also irrelevant to the discrepancy. The fact that the drug has to be administered several times a day and patient compliance could be low does not address or explain why the drug's use could be dangerous.

C: This answer does not reconcile the discrepancy and it contradicts the statement in the context. The statement mentions that the drug is "effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox" which implies that the drug cures the disease in the first person.

D: This answer helps to reconcile the apparent discrepancy. The fact that the drug could be fatal if misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses explains why its widespread use could be dangerous, even though the drug has no serious side effects under normal circumstances.

E: This answer also helps to reconcile the apparent discrepancy, but it contradicts the statement in the context. The statement does not mention anything about the development of deadlier forms of chickenpox from the use of the drug. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  An antidote for chicken pox has been developed. 
  This drug is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  Researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  The drug has no serious side effects.
  
A: This argument focuses on the cost and availability of the new drug.
B: This argument focuses on patient compliance to the treatment regimen.
C: This argument focuses on the fact that the new drug doesn't protect others from getting the disease.
D: This argument discusses the potential risks and dangers of misusing the drug.
E: This argument discusses the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug. 
The statement that best explains the discrepancy is the one that highlights why the drug's widespread use could be dangerous, even though it has no serious side effects and it is effective at controlling chicken pox.
Only choices D and E relate to potential dangers of the drug. However, the fact that there are no serious side effects makes choice E less likely to be the correct answer. Misuse leading to fatalities is a more likely concern than the development of new chicken pox strains resistant to the drug.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  An antidote for chicken pox has been developed.
  The drug is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  The drug has no serious side effects.
  Researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  
A: The price or availability of the medication is irrelevant to the apparent discrepancy of the statement.
B: Patient compliance is also irrelevant to the discrepancy in the statement.
C: The fact that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox does not help reconcile the apparent discrepancy.
D: This choice actually worsens the apparent discrepancy and is not the correct answer.
E: The development of deadlier forms of chicken pox is not consistent with the statement and does not help reconcile the discrepancy.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - An antidote for chicken pox has been developed.
  - The drug has no serious side effects.
  - The drug is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  - Researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  
A: This option does not help to explain the apparent discrepancy between the effectiveness of the drug and the warning of the researchers. 
B: This option talks about the possibility of patient compliance being low but it does not address the apparent discrepancy between the effectiveness of the drug and the warning of the researchers. 
C: This option points out that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox, which could be a reason why the researchers are warning against the widespread use of the drug. However, it does not directly address the apparent discrepancy between the effectiveness of the drug and the warning of the researchers.
D: This option helps to address the warning of the researchers against the widespread use of the drug because it indicates that the drug can be fatal when misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses. However, it does not fully reconcile the apparent discrepancy in the context.
E: This option suggests that the use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug, which would reconcile the apparent discrepancy by highlighting the potential long-term risks of using the drug.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  - The drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.

A: The expense and availability of the drug are not mentioned as factors contributing to the apparent discrepancy.
B: Patient compliance is not mentioned as a factor contributing to the apparent discrepancy.
C: This choice provides additional information about the drug, but it does not help to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the effectiveness of the drug and the researchers' concerns about its widespread use.
D: This choice presents a significant danger associated with the misuse of the drug, but it does not help to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the effectiveness of the drug and the researchers' concerns about its widespread use.
E: This choice suggests that the drug may contribute to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug, which would help to explain the researchers' concerns about the widespread use of the drug.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Researchers warn that the widespread use of an antidote for chicken pox could be dangerous, despite its effectiveness in limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  A: Cost of the antidote is not related to the fact that its use could be dangerous.
  B: Patient compliance is not related to the fact that its use could be dangerous.
  C: The fact that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox does not help reconcile the apparent discrepancy.
  D: The fact that the drug can be fatal when misused further emphasizes the danger of its widespread use.
  E: This statement actually contradicts the effectiveness and safety of the drug.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, it has no serious side effects and is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  Despite its effectiveness, researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous. 
A: The high cost or limited availability of the drug is not a helpful detail in reconciling this discrepancy. 
B: The issue of patient compliance does not help to reconcile the apparent discrepancy either.
C: The fact that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox does not relate to the concern about the dangerous aspect of widespread use.
D: This is the most relevant piece of information. If the drug can be fatal when misused, it is understandable why widespread use may be dangerous.
E: The fact that the use of this drug could contribute to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug is concerning but not in line with the discrepancy the question is asking to address. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  An antidote for chicken pox has been developed that limits the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  Widespread use of the antidote could cause danger despite the fact that it has no serious side effects.
  
A: The fact that the drug is expensive would not really reconcile the discrepancy because the question is about the potential risks and benefits of using the drug, not about its practicality.
B: Patient compliance might factor into the issue, but it doesn't really address the potential dangers of widespread use that researchers are warning about.
C: This fact could be relevant to the issue because it implies that using the drug widely might not be effective at stopping the spread of the disease.
D: This fact would support the warning from the researchers about the potential danger of using the drug widely, even though the drug itself has no serious side effects.
E: This fact would also support the warning from the researchers, because it implies that excessive use of the drug could create a more dangerous version of the disease. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Wells is knowledgeable about the concert business and that he thought a successful concert would sell out unless the promotion were done poorly. And yet the concert did not sell out, so the argument concludes that the promotion was probably done poorly.
  
A: This argument claims that Dr. Smith said the patient would survive only if the surgery were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Then it concludes that since the patient did not survive, the surgery probably was not properly done. This pattern of reasoning is not similar to the argument above, as it draws a conclusion about the surgery on the basis of the condition for survival.
  
B: This argument claims that the Professor thought the sample probably was not labeled correctly as it did not contain organic compounds, which generally should be present. This pattern is different, too, because the conclusion is drawn on the basis of what generally should be present or expected, not about a contrast between an expected outcome and what actually happened.
  
C: This argument claims that the neighbor said the repair would be unnoticeable if it were done properly, but since the damage is still visible, the argument concludes that the repair was not probably done properly. This pattern of reasoning is similar to the argument above, in that it draws the conclusion from what is expected to be the case, based on certain evidence, versus what is actually the case.
  
D: This argument claims that the builder said the roof would not require repairs for years unless it was damaged in a storm. But the roof is already leaking, so the argument concludes that the builder was probably wrong. This pattern of reasoning is different, too, as it concludes that the builder was probably wrong based on the evidence that the roof is leaking despite no reported major storms.
  
E: This argument claims that Professor Yanakita said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. The tests did find lead in the soil, so the argument concludes that they were probably properly conducted. This pattern of reasoning is not similar to the argument above, as it concludes directly from what the expert said about what would happen if something were done properly, versus contrasting the expected outcome with reality.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning where a knowledgeable person predicts a certain outcome, but the outcome does not materialize.
A: This choice presents a pattern in which an outcome was predicted based on a condition being met, but the condition was not met, and thus the outcome did not occur.
B: This choice presents a different pattern where an outcome (presence of organic compounds) is being predicted based on another condition (sample being labeled correctly).
C: This choice presents a pattern that is somewhat similar to the argument in that an outcome was predicted to not happen if certain conditions were met, but the outcome did happen.
D: This choice presents a pattern where an outcome was predicted to not happen based on a certain condition, but the outcome did happen.
E: This choice presents a pattern that is different from the argument - an outcome was predicted based on a certain condition, and the outcome came true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument concludes that the concert was probably not properly promoted based on the fact that Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted, and the concert did not sell out.
A: The argument concludes that the surgery was probably not performed properly based on the fact that Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon, and the patient did not survive the surgery.
B: The argument concludes that the sample is probably not labeled correctly based on the fact that Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds, and the sample is found to contain no organic compounds.
C: The argument concludes that the repair to the wall was probably not properly done based on the fact that the neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired, and the damage is noticeable.
D: The argument concludes that the builder was probably wrong based on the fact that the roof is already leaking, and the builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years unless it is damaged in a storm.
E: The argument concludes that the tests were properly conducted based on the fact that Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted, and the tests did find lead in the soil.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a conditional statement: If the concert is properly promoted, it will sell out.
  The evidence is that Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, thought it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted, but it did not sell out.
  The conclusion is that the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  A: The argument presents a conditional statement: If the heart transplant is properly performed by a highly skilled surgeon, the patient will survive. The evidence is that Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive if it is performed by a highly skilled surgeon, but the patient did not survive. The conclusion is that the surgery was probably not properly performed.
  B: The argument presents a conditional statement: If the sample is labeled correctly, it will contain organic compounds. The evidence is that Professor Willis, who is knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said the sample probably is not labeled correctly, so it probably does not contain organic compounds. The conclusion is that the sample is probably not labeled correctly.
  C: The argument presents a conditional statement: If the wall is properly repaired, the damage will not be noticeable. The evidence is that the neighbor, an experienced home renovator, said that the damage is still noticeable, so the repair was probably not properly done. The conclusion is that the repair was probably not properly done.
  D: The argument presents a conditional statement: If the roof is not damaged in a storm, it will not require repairs for years. The evidence is that the roof is already leaking and there have been no major storms. The conclusion is that the builder was probably wrong.
  E: The argument presents a conditional statement: If the tests are properly conducted, they will find lead in the soil. The evidence is that Professor Yanakita, an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil, and the tests did find lead in the soil. The conclusion is that the tests were probably properly conducted.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wells predicted the concert would sell out unless the promotion was bad, but the concert didn't sell out. Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  A: The argument states that Dr. Smith predicted that the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon, but the patient did not survive the surgery. Therefore, the surgery was probably not properly performed.
  B: The argument states that Professor Willis said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. Therefore, the sample probably is not labeled correctly.
  C: The argument states that the neighbor said that the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done since the damage is still noticeable.
  D: The argument states that the builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years unless it is damaged in a storm, but the roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: The argument states that Professor Yanakita said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted, and the tests did find lead in the soil. Therefore, the tests were probably properly conducted.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
The argument talks about a prediction made by Wells based on their knowledge about concert business, and the situation that followed. The concert did not sell out. 
A: The argument talks about a prediction made by a well-trained doctor based on the skill of a surgeon for a heart transplant operation with the situation that followed. The patient did not survive the surgery. 
B: The argument talks about a prediction made by a chemistry expert based on the sample's organic compound content with the situation that followed. The sample did not contain organic compounds. 
C: The argument talks about a prediction made by a neighbor based on their experience at home renovation with the situation that followed. The wall still has noticeable damage after a repair. 
D: The argument talks about a prediction made by a builder based on a specific condition with the situation that followed. The school's roof is leaking and there have been no major storms. 
E: The argument talks about a prediction made by an expert on a subject based on the proper conduction of tests with the situation that followed. The test found lead in the soil. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument outlines a pattern of reasoning in which "someone who is knowledgeable about a subject makes a prediction, and the outcome suggests that the prediction was incorrect. The argument concludes that the prediction was probably incorrect because the outcome did not match the prediction." 
A: The pattern of reasoning involves a prediction based on expertise, which is then contradicted by an event. The conclusion is that the event undermines the prediction. This is similar to the argument in that both involve an expert, a prediction, and an outcome that undermines the prediction.
B: This pattern of reasoning involves an expert making a prediction, but instead of being contradicted by an outcome, the prediction is used to support a conclusion about the cause of the outcome. It is not similar to the argument.
C: The pattern of reasoning involves an expert making a prediction about a situation, followed by an event that calls that prediction into question. However, the argument in the passage focuses on a specific issue (poor promotion) rather than a general situation.
D: This is a pattern of reasoning that relies on an appeal to authority in which an expert's prediction is contradicted by the outcome. However, the conclusion relates to the reliability of the authority rather than the validity of the prediction as in the argument.
E: The pattern of reasoning involves an expert making a prediction, followed by an event that confirms or undermines the prediction. However, unlike the argument in the passage, the conclusion does not follow the premise of the prediction being probably incorrect because the outcome did not match the prediction.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument points out that Wells believed the concert would sell out if it was properly promoted, but it did not sell out. Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
A: This argument presents a similar pattern of reasoning. Dr. Smith states that if the heart transplant surgery is performed by a skilled surgeon, then the patient will survive. However, since the patient did not survive, Dr. Smith's reasoning leads to the conclusion that the surgery was not properly performed.
B: This argument presents a different pattern of reasoning. Professor Willis states that if the sample is labeled correctly, then it should contain organic compounds. However, since the sample does not contain organic compounds, Professor Willis believes it was not labeled correctly.
C: This argument presents a different pattern of reasoning. The neighbor states that if the wall repair was properly done, then the damage would not be noticeable. However, since the damage is still noticeable, the neighbor believes the repair was not properly done.
D: This argument presents a different pattern of reasoning. The builder states that if there are no major storms, then the roof will not require repairs for years. However, even though there have been no major storms, the roof is leaking. Therefore, the builder was probably wrong.
E: This argument presents a different pattern of reasoning. Professor Yanakita states that the tests will find lead in the soil if they are properly conducted. However, since the tests did find lead in the soil, Professor Yanakita believes they were properly conducted.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument is about a prediction made by Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted, and the fact that the concert did not sell out. 

A: The argument is about a prediction made by Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, that the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon, and the fact that the patient did not survive the surgery. 
B: The argument is about a prediction made by Professor Willis that the sample probably does not contain any organic compounds, and the assumption that the sample should be labeled correctly if it did contain organic compounds.
C: The argument is about a prediction made by a neighbor, an experienced home renovator, that the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired, and the fact that it is still noticeable.
D: The argument is about a prediction made by a builder that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm, and the fact that the roof is already leaking.
E: The argument is about a prediction made by Professor Yanakita, an expert on the subject, that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted, and the fact that the tests did find lead in the soil.

Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
In both the argument and choice B, the reasoning is based on the assumption that if something were correct or true, certain consequences would follow. This assumption is used to infer that, since the consequences did not occur, the original claim must not be correct or true.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The argument presents a pattern of reasoning where Wells, an individual with expertise in concert promotions, predicted that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. The concert did not sell out, so it is inferred that it was poorly promoted.

A: The argument employs a similar pattern in which Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, predicted the patient would survive unless the heart transplant was poorly performed. The patient did not survive, so it is inferred the surgery was performed poorly.

B: The argument presents a different pattern of reasoning. Professor Willis predicts the sample does not contain organic compounds if organic chemistry knowledge was used to conclude it. Therefore, if the sample does contain organic compounds, it is labeled incorrectly.

C: The argument employs a similar pattern of reasoning in which a neighbor with experience in home renovation predicts the wall damage will not be noticeable if repaired correctly. Since the damage is noticeable, the inference is that the repair was not done correctly.

D: The argument presents a different pattern of reasoning. The builder predicts no roof repairs will be necessary unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof leaks even though there have been no storms. This shows the builder's prediction failed.

E: The argument presents a different pattern of reasoning. Professor Yanakita predicts the tests will find lead if properly conducted. It is found, so it is concluded the tests were correctly conducted.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument asserts that standing and walking upright is a completely natural behavior of Kodiak bears based on their bone structure.
A: This criticism attacks the generalizability of the argument. However, the argument provides evidence to support its conclusion rather than making a generalization based on a few cases.
B: This criticism attacks the argument by suggesting that the conclusion is too restricted. However, the argument only claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior and does not claim that bears can only walk on their hind legs.
C: This criticism challenges the use of the term "behavior" in the argument but is not valid since the argument uses the term consistently and does not change its meaning.
D: This criticism attacks the argument through questioning a broader assumption about behavior. However, the argument provides specific evidence to support its conclusion about Kodiak bears rather than making a general claim about all behaviors.
E: This criticism attacks the argument's appeal to the authority of science but is not valid since the argument is based on scientific evidence and makes a valid conclusion based on that evidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument is stating that because of the Kodiak bear's bone structure, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not learned. 
  A: The argument supports the conclusion that the behavior is natural; therefore, generalizing the conclusion using a few examples is not a vulnerability for the argument, but stronger support.
  B: Accounted for; the argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior.
  C: The argument is consistent in the meaning of the word "behavior."
  D: The argument does not make any assumption about the two ways of explaining all behavior.
  E: The argument bases its conclusion in scientific observation but does not claim to be an authority in science.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument is based on a claim about the Kodiak bears' natural behavior based on the structure of their hip and foot bones.
A: The argument does not generalize from the behavior of a few bears, but rather states that the structure of the bones indicates a natural behavior of the species.
B: The argument is vulnerable to this criticism since it assumes that walking on hind legs is entirely an innate capacity without considering the possibility of learned behavior.
C: The argument does not change the meaning of the word "behavior" during the course of the argument.
D: The argument does not assume that all behavior can only be explained in one or both of two ways.
E: The argument does not appeal to the authority of science to support its conclusion, but rather presents a biological observation about the physical structure of a species.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is an instinctive behavior of Kodiak bears, based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  A: This criticism is not applicable because the argument does not generalize from a few bears, but rather appeals to a specific biological characteristic of Kodiak bears.
  B: This criticism is a potential weakness of the argument because it assumes that walking on hind legs is innate, and does not consider the possible influence of learning.
  C: This criticism is not applicable because there is no evident change in the meaning of the word "behavior" during the argument.
  D: This criticism is not applicable because the argument does not make any presumptions about the ways in which all behavior can be explained.
  E: This criticism is not applicable because the argument is not appealing to an authority, but rather is using scientific evidence to support its claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument states that because of Kodiak bears' hip and foot bone structure, walking on hind legs is completely natural and instinctive, and not a learned behavior.

A: This choice suggests that the argument may have relied on a small sample of Kodiak bears. But the argument does not mention any specific sample size or the number of bears studies and thus cannot be said to have incorrectly generalized from the behavior of a few bears.
B: This choice suggests that the argument is wrong because it did not consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity. However, the argument claims that walking on hind legs is completely natural and instinctive and there is no mention of it being the result of both learning and an innate capacity. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.
C: This choice suggests that the argument uses the term "behavior" in two different senses. However, there is no change in the meaning of the term 'behavior' in the argument. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.
D: This choice suggests that the argument is presuming without justification that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways. However, the argument only refers to one specific behavior - walking on hind legs in Kodiak bears - and makes no such presumption about all behaviors in general.
E: The argument does not appeal to the authority of science. It merely states a biological fact about Kodiak bears.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is a natural and instinctive behavior of Kodiak bears, as demonstrated by the shape of their hip and foot bones. 

A: This criticism is not applicable to the argument because it does not generalize from a small sample to a larger population. Rather, the argument makes a general claim about all Kodiak bears based on biological evidence.
B: This criticism is a possible vulnerability of the argument. The argument does not address the possibility that walking on hind legs is a learned behavior influenced by environmental factors as well. 
C: This criticism does not pose a threat to the argument as there is no evidence that the word "behavior" changes meaning throughout the argument.
D: This criticism is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not suggest that there are only two possible explanations for behavior, it only provides evidence for one possible explanation. 
E: This criticism does not apply to the argument as the argument is based on biological evidence, not an appeal to authority. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that walking on hind legs is completely natural behavior for Kodiak bears based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  A: This criticism is not relevant as the argument is not generalizing from the behavior of a few bears but rather it is based on a physiological characteristic.
  B: This could be a valid criticism as the argument assumes that walking on hind legs is solely an innate capacity. However, the argument is based on the physical characteristics of Kodiak bears rather than its behavior.
  C: This criticism is not relevant as the word "behavior" is used consistently throughout the argument.
  D: This criticism is not relevant as the argument does not presume that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: This criticism is not relevant as the argument is not appealing to the authority of science but rather presenting scientific evidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bears, and this conclusion is based on the shape of their hip and foot bones. 
  A: This is not a concern for the argument because the conclusion is based on evidence that applies to all Kodiak bears, not just a few of them. 
  B: This may be a valid criticism of the argument, but it is not the most relevant one. 
  C: The argument does not change the meaning of the word "behavior".
  D: The argument does not presume that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument does not appeal to the authority of science; it uses scientific evidence to support its conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for Kodiak bears because of the shape of their hip and foot bones. Thus, walking on hind legs is claimed to be an instinctive and not a learned behavior of these bears.
A: This choice is a possible criticism, but the argument mentions the shape of the hip and foot bones of Kodiak bears, suggesting that the inference is being drawn from some relevant evidence, rather than from a few observed cases.
B: This choice is less likely to be the criticism, as the argument specifically claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not learned.
C: The argument does not seem to be exchanging meanings of the word "behavior" during the argument.
D: The argument is only focused on Kodiak bear's behavior and it is not making any claim or assumption about the generalization of behavior as this choice suggest.
E: The argument does not seem to be relying on unchallenged authority of science to conclude that standing and walking upright is a natural behavior for Kodiak bears.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The argument posits that walking on hind legs is not a learned behavior of Kodiak bears and is instead natural or instinctive. 
A: This choice presents a criticism that the argument is based on a small sample size of bears. However, the argument doesn't quantify the number of bears studied and even if it is small, the argument is not necessarily vulnerable.
B: This choice suggests that walking on hind legs may be a combination of learned behavior and innate capacity. However, the argument posits that walking on hind legs is completely natural behavior for Kodiak bears, so it is not vulnerable to this criticism.
C: This choice attacks the argument's use of the term "behavior," which is not justified in the context of the argument. However, this criticism is not a serious challenge to the argument's conclusion.
D: This choice implies that the argument oversimplifies the cause of behavior by suggesting it can only be the result of innate capacity or learning. It is not a criticism the argument is most vulnerable to.
E: This choice accuses the argument of incorrectly appealing to the authority and credibility of science. However, the argument presents evidence to support its conclusion and does not misuse or inappropriately rely on science as an authority.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In marketing their products, drug companies often send gifts to physicians. According to a recent survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Question: If the survey results are accurate, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts.
  B: Most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians.
  C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  D: Some physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts.
  E: All physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  According to the survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. However, the same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Choices: 
  A: The survey results do not provide information regarding the likelihood of physicians prescribing unnecessary drugs based on their acceptance or rejection of gifts from drug companies.
  B: The survey results do not provide information regarding what most physicians believe drug companies should do.
  C: This choice presents a possibility that some physicians could be mistaken about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians. However, it does not follow that some physicians are mistaken.
  D: This choice presents a possibility that some physicians, who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts, believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts.
  E: This choice presents a possibility that ALL physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  A: The passage does not offer information about the likelihood of prescribing unnecessary drugs for physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies.
  B: The passage does not provide support for this statement.
  C: This option is consistent with the survey results presented in the passage.
  D: The passage does not suggest whether physicians who admit their own choices are influenced by gifts believe that other physicians are influenced to a greater or lesser degree.
  E: The passage does not provide information about all physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  A: This choice is not directly related to the information provided in the survey.
  B: The survey did not ask physicians for their opinion on whether drug companies should adopt new guidelines.
  C: This choice fits the survey results and is a possibility, as some physicians may have inaccurate beliefs about the influence of gifts on their own and other physicians' prescription choices.
  D: This choice is a possibility, as some physicians may believe that other physicians are more influenced by gifts than they themselves are.
  E: The survey results do not provide enough information to support this choice, as it only reports the beliefs of most physicians on other physicians' prescription choices.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The survey indicates that most physicians think their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, while they believe that the majority of physicians are influenced by such gifts.
  
A: The survey did not provide information about physicians who accept or do not accept gifts, so it is not possible to draw a conclusion about unnecessary drug prescriptions and gender bias. 
B: While the survey might suggest that most physicians have concerns about the impact of drug companies' gifts, it does not specify that most physicians believe that new guidelines are needed to regulate drug companies' marketing practice.
C: This choice is a possible conclusion that can be drawn from the survey results, as the survey indicates that physicians' perceptions of themselves and others may sometimes be at odds with reality.
D: This cannot be concluded from the information provided by the survey. The survey only indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts.
E: This conclusion cannot be inferred from the survey results since it states that all physicians who admit their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced. The survey does not indicate such an absolute relationship.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - The survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own choices are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. 
  - The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
 
A: The passage does not provide information on the prescribing habits of physicians who accept gifts versus those who don't. Hence there isn't enough information to support choice A.
B: The passage suggests nothing about what physicians believe drug companies should do about their gift-giving practices. Hence there isn't enough information to support choice B.
C: This choice is consistent with the information given in the passage. It states that some physicians might be wrong about the extent to which they are influenced by drug companies' gifts or about the level of influence that such gifts have on other physicians. Hence this option is correct. 
D: The passage does not provide any basis for a comparison between the degree to which physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts. Hence there isn't enough information to support choice D.
E: The passage only communicates that physicians believe their own prescription choices are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but that is not the same as saying that all physicians who admit their choices are influenced think that their colleagues' choices are also influenced. Hence there isn't enough information to support choice E.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The survey shows that most physicians believe that their own choices are not influenced, but believe that most other physicians are influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  A: The survey does not provide any information about the likelihood of prescribing unnecessary drugs by physicians who accept gifts or do not accept gifts from drug companies.
  B: The survey does not provide any information about the beliefs of physicians regarding guidelines governing drug companies' gift-giving practices.
  C: This may be a possibility based on the survey results indicating a discrepancy in perception between the effect of gifts on oneself and others.
  D: This may be a possibility based on the survey results indicating a discrepancy in perception between the effect of gifts on oneself and others.
  E: The survey only provides information about the beliefs of physicians, but it does not claim that all physicians hold the same belief.

Knowledge: 
  According to the survey results, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are NOT influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  A: The survey did not provide information about the likelihood of physicians who accept gifts to prescribe unnecessary drugs, so it cannot be concluded that physicians who do not accept gifts are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs.
  B: The survey only provides information about physicians' beliefs regarding the influence of drug companies' gifts on prescription choices and does not indicate that most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines.
  C: This is a possible inference from the survey results, as some physicians may have mistaken beliefs about the influence of such gifts.
  D: The survey indicates that physicians' own choices are not influenced by gifts, but they believe that other physicians' choices are, so it is likely that some physicians who admit to being influenced by gifts would also believe that other physicians are influenced to a greater degree.

Knowledge:
  The survey found that most physicians believe they are not influenced by drug companies' gifts but that most other physicians are influenced by such gifts.
Choices:
  A: The survey did not provide information about whether physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies prescribe unnecessary drugs less often than those who do. This cannot be concluded from the survey results.
  B: The survey did not provide information about what most physicians believe drug companies should do. This cannot be concluded from the survey results.
  C: This choice is logical and can be inferred from the survey results. The survey found that most physicians believe they are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe most other physicians are influenced by such gifts. This is evidence that some physicians may be mistaken about their own degree of influence by drug companies' gifts or the degree of influence on other physicians.
  D: The survey did not provide information about whether physicians who admit they are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree than their own. This cannot be concluded from the survey results.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The professor argues that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress because thinkers need intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas. The conclusion of the professor follows logically if the assumption supports this argument.
  A: This statement provides support for the argument that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress.
  B: This statement might provide some indirect support for the argument if it implies that a society that values intellectual progress will also instill intellectual discipline among its thinkers. However, it is not a necessary assumption for the argument that the professor makes.
  C: This statement contradicts the argument made by the professor. The professor does not claim that intellectual discipline is lacking in free societies.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument made by the professor.
  E: This statement supports the argument that intellectual discipline is necessary for freedom of thought to be of any merit.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument in the question presents two opposing concepts of intellectual progress: freedom of thought and intellectual discipline. The professor argues that freedom of thought is not enough, because intellectual discipline is also necessary for intellectual progress. Since the argument presents these two as opposing values, the conclusion would follow logically if it is assumed that they cannot both be present at the same time. 
  A: This answer choice suggests that a limitation on one type of thinking would hinder intellectual progress, but it does not assert that freedom of thought and intellectual discipline are incompatible.
  B: This answer choice talks about the context in which intellectual progress occurs, not about the relationship between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline.
  C: This answer choice makes an unfounded blanket statement about the behavior of thinkers in societies that protect freedom of thought. The argument does not suggest that these values are incompatible nor that they could not coexist.
  D: This answer choice again suggests that freedom of thought may encourage a quality that aids intellectual progress. It does not address the question of whether intellectual discipline is necessary along with freedom of thought.
  E: This answer choice supports the argument by making a statement about the necessity of intellectual discipline.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The professor argues that intellectual progress requires not only freedom of thought but also intellectual discipline. Thus, a conclusion follows logically if it assumes that something that the professor advocates (or something that is incompatible with something the professor rejects) must be true.
A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument made by the professor, which states that intellectual progress requires not only freedom of thought but also intellectual discipline.
B: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument made by the professor, which states that intellectual progress requires not only freedom of thought but also intellectual discipline.
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument made by the professor, which states that intellectual progress requires not only freedom of thought but also intellectual discipline.
D: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument made by the professor, which states that intellectual progress requires not only freedom of thought but also intellectual discipline.
E: This answer choice supports the argument made by the professor, who maintains that intellectual progress requires not only freedom of thought but also intellectual discipline. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that freedom of thought is necessary for intellectual progress but thinkers also need intellectual discipline to explore the full implications of their interrelated ideas. 
  The professor concludes that the argument for freedom of thought fails.

Action: Answer("E")  
The professor's conclusion that the argument for freedom of thought fails follows logically if it is assumed that without intellectual discipline, thinkers cannot have freedom of thought.
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument presented by the professor is that freedom of thought is not enough to achieve intellectual progress. To achieve intellectual progress, thinkers also need intellectual discipline. Therefore, the conclusion must be based on this assumption.
A: This statement supports the argument that thinkers need more than just an orthodoxy to achieve intellectual progress, but it does not necessarily support the conclusion that freedom of thought fails as an argument.
B: This statement suggests that a society that values intellectual progress is necessary for thinkers to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas, but it does not necessarily support the conclusion that freedom of thought fails as an argument.
C: This statement contradicts the argument that thinkers need intellectual discipline to make intellectual progress and thus cannot support the conclusion that the argument for freedom of thought fails.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument presented by the professor because it does not address the question of whether freedom of thought is enough for intellectual progress.
E: This statement directly supports the argument made by the professor that intellectual discipline is needed to achieve intellectual progress. If thinkers lack intellectual discipline, they will not be able to achieve intellectual progress, even if they enjoy freedom of thought. Therefore, the conclusion that the argument for freedom of thought fails logically follows if this assumption is made.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The professor argues against the notion that freedom of thought alone is sufficient for intellectual progress.
  A: This answer choice does not logically connect to the professor's argument.
  B: This answer choice does not logically connect to the professor's argument.
  C: This answer choice does not logically connect to the professor's argument.
  D: This answer choice contradicts the professor's argument, which suggests that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress.
  E: This answer choice logically connects to the professor's argument, as the professor suggests that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The professor argues that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress and that intellectual discipline is needed to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas. The conclusion follows logically if one of the answer choices is a necessary assumption for the argument.

A: This statement is related to intellectual progress, but it does not directly support the professor's argument about the importance of intellectual discipline.
B: This statement is not relevant to the professor's argument about intellectual discipline being necessary for progress.
C: This statement is directly contradicted by the professor's argument that intellectual discipline is necessary for progress in societies that protect freedom of thought.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The argument mentions that computer models have shown that the neck structure in Diplodocus would prevent high neck movement. Diplodocus did feed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument and does not have any impact on the argument.
B: This answer choice is not mentioned in the argument.
C: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument and does not have any impact on the argument.
D: This answer choice suggests that Diplodocus may have had other ways of accessing high-growing vegetation, which goes against the argument that the neck structure prevents high neck movement.
E: This answer choice suggests that there may have been other ways for Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation, which goes against the argument that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The context talks about computer models showing that Diplodocus's neck structure was not suitable for browsing on treetop leaves but rather for underwater vegetation. The argument makes a conclusion based on the neck bones structure of Diplodocus to infer the feeding habits of the dinosaur. 
A: The neck structure of other animals is not relevant to the argument. Incorrect.
B: There is no mention of Diplodocus's head angle in the argument. Incorrect.
C: The argument does not discuss the blood supply to the brain of Diplodocus. Incorrect.
D: The argument does suggest that Diplodocus could have accessed high-growing vegetation by other means. Incorrect.
E: The argument mentions that Diplodocus could browse underwater vegetation from dry land, but not how it could approach the edge of the water. Therefore, the argument does not require this assumption. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The argument highlights that computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse high-growing vegetation. On the contrary it could bend downward and extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land, suggesting that it fed on plants on or near the ground or underwater.
A: The argument does not compare Diplodocus with modern ground-feeding animals, hence it is not an assumption required by the argument.
B: The argument does not mention whether Diplodocus could see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward, hence it is not an assumption required by the argument.
C: The argument does not reference the ability of Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain, hence it is not an assumption required by the argument.
D: The argument suggests that Diplodocus could have fed on plants on or near the ground and underwater, thus it is not an assumption required by the argument to assume that it had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
E: The argument does not discuss the possibility of Diplodocus browsing for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, hence it is not an assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The argument suggests that Diplodocus couldn't browse for high-growing vegetation since raising its neck was impossible, but it could bend downward and extend below ground level, allowing access to underwater vegetation on dry land.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. The argument doesn't depend on whether modern ground-feeding animals have the same type of neck structure as Diplodocus.
B: The argument doesn't mention anything related to Diplodocus's ability to see in front of itself. Thus, this statement is irrelevant.
C: The statement is not related or relevant to the argument. The argument discusses the role of neck structure in accessing food and not Diplodocus's brain size or blood supply to its brain.
D: The argument doesn't suggest that Diplodocus had no other ways of accessing high-growing vegetation. Instead, the argument talks about how Diplodocus could access vegetation below ground level or on land.
E: The statement is relevant to the argument because it suggests that Diplodocus could have browsed underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or even walking into them. However, the argument doesn't consider this possibility and only focuses on Diplodocus's ability to bend downwards and even extend below the ground level to access underwater vegetation on dry land.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing what Diplodocus could have fed on based on the structure of its neck bones. 
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This statement conflicts with the argument, which states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  E: This statement is relevant to the argument because the argument claims that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land. If Diplodocus were able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, this would weaken the argument's conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument explains that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from browsing high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its neck and that it could bend downward and extend its neck below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Therefore, it must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. 
A: The argument does not require any information about modern ground-feeding animals,  so it is not an assumption required by the argument.
B: The argument does not suggest or require any information about Diplodocus's vision, so it is not an assumption required by the argument.
C: The argument does not require any information about Diplodocus's brain circulation or the ability of large animals to supply blood to elevated organs, so it is not an assumption required by the argument.
D: The argument does not assume or require information about whether Diplodocus had any other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, so it is not an assumption required by the argument.
E: The argument suggests that Diplodocus could have accessed underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not assume or require any information about whether Diplodocus was unable to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them. Therefore, it is not an assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The argument explains that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would prevent it from raising its long neck to browse for high-growing vegetation. However, it could bend its neck downward and below ground level to access underwater vegetation, indicating that it likely fed on plants on or near the ground.
A: The argument does not state or require any information about whether modern ground-feeding animals have a similar neck structure to that of Diplodocus.
B: The argument does not discuss Diplodocus's ability to see in front of itself.
C: The argument does not discuss Diplodocus's brain.
D: The argument only explains that Diplodocus is not able to browse for high-growing vegetation by raising its long neck, but it does not make any assumptions about the existence of alternative methods for accessing elevated vegetation.
E: The argument does not discuss whether Diplodocus is able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The argument discusses that computer models have shown the neck bones of Diplodocus would have prevented high neck movement. The neck could bend downwards and extend forward allowing access to underwater vegetation from dry land. 
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument.
C: This statement is not related to the argument.
D: This may be an alternative assumption, but the argument does not support or mention it.
E: This assumption is related to the argument and supports the conclusion. If Diplodocus were able to browse underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking, then the inability to raise its neck to feed on treetop leaves will not restrict its feeding options. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument is discussing the feeding habits of Diplodocus, a dinosaur with a long neck. Computer models have shown that Diplodocus was not able to raise its neck very high, but could instead bend its neck downward and even extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  
A: This option relates to modern ground-feeding animals and doesn't affect the argument about Diplodocus's feeding habits.
B: This option suggests a limitation in Diplodocus's ability to see and is not required by the argument.
C: This option is not relevant to the feeding habits of Diplodocus and is not required by the argument.
D: This option suggests another possible way that Diplodocus could have accessed high-growing vegetation, but the argument is not concerned with other possibilities.
E: This option presents another way that Diplodocus could have accessed underwater vegetation, but the argument is not concerned with other possibilities.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The argument talks about computer models that reveal the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones. 
The model shows that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its long neck to browse for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves. 
The neck could bend downward and extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
Thus, based on the argument, Diplodocus must not have browsed for high-growing vegetation.

Assumption: The argument relies on an assumption that is needed to make the conclusion that Diplodocus must not have browsed for high-growing vegetation.

Analysis of Choices:
  A: The argument does not depend on any information about modern ground-feeding animals. Incorrect.
  B: The argument does not provide any information about Diplodocus's vision. Incorrect.
  C: The argument does not refer to blood flow to an elevated brain. Incorrect.
  D: The argument does not suggest that Diplodocus could only access vegetation by browsing high-growing plants. Incorrect.
  E: This assumption directly relates to the main conclusion of the argument. If Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation more easily by kneeling or walking into bodies of water, this could change the conclusion of the argument. Correct.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument is claiming that because everyone the author knows voted against the proposal, then the official results must be rigged. This is a flaw in reasoning because the author is assuming that their personal circle is representative of the entire population. It is possible for the author's social circle to have a biased sample or for there to be other factors that explain the discrepancy. So, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Choice A best describes this flaw in reasoning.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument uses evidence from a sample of people the speaker knows, making it unlikely to be representative of the general population. If the sample used to support the argument is not representative of the general population, it is not accurate to assume that most people voted against the proposal based solely on the speaker's personal experience. This is a common flaw in reasoning called "hasty generalization," or drawing conclusions based on insufficient evidence. Choices B-E do not accurately descrthe flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The argument says that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal and, therefore, the official results must be rigged. This is a hasty generalization fallacy, which involves drawing a conclusion about a population based on a sample that is too small or not representative. The speaker knows only a tiny fraction of the people who voted and may belong to a particular subgroup that is not representative of the general population. Thus, A is the choice that most accurately describes the flaw in the argument. B is incorrect because the argument is not circular; that is, it does not presume the truth of the conclusion it sets out to prove. C is incorrect because the argument does not attack the proponents of a claim; it merely dismisses the official results based on a hasty generalization. D is incorrect because it does not involve making the distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted. Finally, E is irrelevant because the argument does not defend a claim only because most people believe it.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument relies solely on anecdotal evidence, which is an unreliable way to draw conclusions about the general population. Just because the people the arguer knows all voted against the proposal, it doesn't mean that most people did the same. Therefore the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The argument claims that everyone the person knows voted against the proposal and thus the results of the vote were rigged. However, this is illogical as the people one knows might not be representative of the general population. It is possible that there were others who voted in favour of the proposal that one simply does not know.

A: The argument does rely on evidence drawn from a sample; however, it is not that it is unlikely to be representative of the general population. 
B: The argument does not presume the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove. 
C: The argument does not reject a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim. 
D: The argument does not fail to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted. 
E: The argument does not defend a claim solely based on the grounds that most people believe it.
 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument is flawed because it suggests that the personal experience of the person making the argument - that everyone they know voted against the proposal - is more reliable than the official results of the referendum. However, this is based on a small sample size and it is unlikely to be representative of the general population. Therefore, choice A best describes the flaw in the reasoning of the argument. The other answer choices are not relevant to the specific flaw in this argument.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The statement is based on the claim that everyone I know voted against the proposal, therefore, the speaker argues that it is clear evidence that most people voted against it. However, this claim fails to recognize that the group of people the speaker knows may not represent the general population. Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population, which is a classic example of hasty generalization. Choice A accurately describes this flaw. Choices B, C, D, and E do not accurately describe the flaw.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that the official results must be rigged because everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal.
  A: The argument does not provide information about the sampling method or how representative it is of the general population.
  B: The argument does not presume the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove. Rather, it presents evidence and an inference based on that evidence.
  C: The argument does not attack the proponents of the claim, but rather addresses the official results of the national referendum.
  D: The argument fails to make a distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted. Instead, it relies on personal anecdotes as evidence.
  E: The argument does not defend a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")
Knowledge:
  The speaker claims that the official results must be rigged because everyone he or she knows voted against the proposal, and therefore, the evidence that most people voted in favour of the proposal is invalid.
  A: The speaker is drawing a conclusion based on a non-representative sample of people he or she knows while ignoring the larger population. 
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion, an instance of circular reasoning.
  C: The argument uses a personal attack against the proponents of the claim rather than disputing their evidence or reasoning.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument does not defend a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
The speaker is dismissing official results that contradict his own anecdotal evidence solely on the grounds that everyone he knows voted the opposite way. This implies that he believes that what most people say is sufficient to establish truth. This is a logical fallacy known as the argument from consensus. It is possible that the people the speaker knows are not a representative sample.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Inez: The book we are reading, The Nature of Matter, is mistitled. A title should summarize the content of the whole book, but nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy. Antonio: I do not think that the author erred; according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the conversation above?
Choices:
  A: Inez believes that the book should be called The Nature of Energy.
  B: Antonio believes that there are no differences between matter and energy.
  C: Inez and Antonio disagree on whether matter and energy are related.
  D: Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book.
  E: Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

In the conversation, Inez points out that the book's title is mistitled because half of it is devoted to discussing a different subject- energy. Antonio disagrees and believes that matter and energy are related. Therefore, the answer is not (A) because Inez only thinks that the book's title should mention energy, not that it should be the only subject. The answer is not (B) either because Antonio acknowledges that matter and energy are related but does not claim that they are identical. The answer is not (C) because both Inez and Antonio agree that matter and energy are related. The answer is not (D) because neither Inez nor Antonio makes any comment about the book's overall value. The only statement that is strongly supported by the conversation is (E) that Inez believes that the book's title should acknowledge matter and energy together, rather than focusing on matter alone.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
Inez and Antonio do not disagree about the relationship between matter and energy. Antonio is arguing that the book's title is appropriate because matter and energy are related, while Inez argues that the book should be titled differently because almost half of it discusses energy. Choice A is incorrect because Inez does not explicitly state what the book's title should be. Choice B is incorrect because Antonio acknowledges that matter and energy are related, but he does not argue that they are not different. Choice C is incorrect because Inez and Antonio agree that matter and energy are related, and they do not voice disagreement on this subject. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication that Inez and Antonio disagree about the value of the book. The best answer is E because Inez believes the book's title should reflect the relatedness of matter and energy, and thus include both terms in the title.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
Inez's statement suggests that she thinks the book's title should be revised to account for the discussion of energy within it. Antonio's statement suggests that he thinks matter and energy are closely related, which addresses Inez's concern about the book's content and title. Therefore, the option that best aligns with the conversation and is most strongly supported by it is that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy (option E). If she believed the book should be called "The Nature of Energy", she would have said that directly. The conversation does not provide evidence for options B, C, or D.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

Inez thinks the title of the book is inappropriate because it only mentions matter and not energy which comprises nearly half of the book. However, Antonio disagrees stating that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Therefore, E is the correct answer because Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
Inez thinks that the book title is inappropriate as it doesn't reflect that nearly half of the book is on energy, which is closely related to matter. Antonio doesn't believe that the author erred and thinks that matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. Therefore, it can be inferred that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Option A is not correct as Inez doesn't specifically propose the alternative title 'The Nature of Energy.' Option B is incorrect as it is an extreme and unsupported statement. Option C is incorrect as it implies disagreement on the close relationship between matter and energy, which both speakers agree on. Option D is also incorrect as there was no discussion on the overall value of the book.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: Inez claims that the book's title is mistitled because it only mentions matter but not energy despite nearly half of the book being devoted to the subject of energy. Antonio rebuts this argument by stating that matter and energy are closely related. This implies that Inez believes the title of the book should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Therefore, the best answer is E, "Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy."
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: Inez argues that the book's title should not refer only to matter while ignoring the fact that nearly half the book discusses energy. Antonio counters that modern physics views matter and energy as two facets of the same phenomenon, suggesting that he views the book as appropriately titled. However, neither of them express an opinion about the name "The Nature of Energy," so we cannot infer that Inez thinks the title ought to be that. Likewise, Antonio cannot be said to believe that there are no differences between matter and energy, as he claims that they are related, but does not make the more extreme statement that they are identical. As for (C) and (D), they are non-sequiturs: the conversation is not about whether matter and energy are related or about the book's value. Answer (E), on the other hand, best represents Inez's position and her critique of the book's title.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  Inez complains that the book title is inaccurate because the book discusses not only matter but energy as well, but the title only mentions matter.
  Antonio disagrees because, according to modern physics, matter and energy are two sides of the same thing, so the title is correct.

Reasoning:
  Inez believes that the book's title is not appropriate because the book discusses not only matter but also energy, and the title only mentions matter. Therefore, it can be inferred that she thinks the title should be comprehensive enough to reflect that the book discusses both matter and energy. Option A only mentions energy, which is not what she intends to emphasize. Option B is refuted by Antonio's assertion in the context that matter and energy are the same thing. Option C is also incorrect because Inez and Antonio agree that matter and energy are related. Option D is not supported either because the conversation does not address the value of the book. The only option that matches the context is E because Inez argues that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. 

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
Inez argues that since the book discusses energy so extensively, the title should reference both matter and energy. Antonio disagrees, saying that matter and energy are different facets of the same phenomenon, implying that it was appropriate to use "The Nature of Matter" as a title. Therefore, it can be concluded that Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. Option A and B can be eliminated because they are extreme views that are not held by any of the speakers. Option C and Option D are both wrong because Inez and Antonio do not express disagreement on matter and energy's relation or the book's overall value, respectively.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  Inez is objecting to the title of the book, saying that "The Nature of Matter" is a misleading title because the book also covers energy. 
  Antonio thinks that the title is fine and that energy is closely related to matter according to modern physics.

Reasoning: Based on the conversation above, Inez believes that the title of the book is mistitled, specifically because it focuses only on matter and doesn't mention energy. This is most closely related to choice E.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychologist: The obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously. However much society may have changed over the centuries, human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction. Thus, the important social function of positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can be served only if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the psychologist's argument by the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously?
Choices:
  A: It is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion.
  B: It is used to counter a consideration that might be taken to undermine the argument's conclusion.
  C: It is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
  D: It is used to identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned.
  E: It is the conclusion that the argument is intended to support.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The psychologist argues that expressing gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously because humans are primarily driven by personal interaction and positive social reinforcement requires knowledge of the gratitude's source. 
A: The claim is not being used as an illustration in support of the argument's conclusion.
B: The claim is not being used to counter a consideration that might undermine the conclusion.
C: This choice is possible, but it is not the most accurate - the claim is not supporting another claim that directly supports the conclusion.
D: The claim is identifying the social benefit that the psychologist's argument is concerned with, but it is not the only role it plays in the argument.
E: The claim is not the conclusion the argument is intended to support.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The psychologist argues that expressing gratitude anonymously does not fulfill the obligation to express gratitude, and that personal interaction is necessary to fulfill this obligation. This necessity is related to the reinforcement of beneficial behavior, which can help identify the source of gratitude.
A: The claim is not used as an example or instance of another premise.
B: The claim is not a counter-consideration to an objection against the argument.
C: This option describes the relationship between the claim and the argument, as the claim is used to support a claim that in turn supports the conclusion.
D: This option is somewhat related to the argument, but it does not describe the role of the claim in the argument.
E: The claim is not the conclusion of the argument. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument asserts that expressing gratitude must not be done anonymously because human psychology is driven primarily by personal interaction. It is argued that a benefactor must know the source of the gratitude in order for that benefactor to continue exhibiting behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others. 
A: The claim does not support the argument but rather serves as premise.
B: The claim is not intended to counter any undermining consideration.
C: The claim is used to directly support the argument's conclusion.
D: The claim identifies the social benefit with which the argument is concerned indirectly.
E: The claim is not the argument's conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")   
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The psychologist argues that because human psychology is still primarily driven by personal interaction, the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously- thus, it's important that the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude. This supports the idea that positively reinforcing beneficial behaviors can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude. 
A: The claim isn't illustrated with any premise.
B: It isn't used to counter a consideration.
C: The claim is used directly, not indirectly.
D: The claim identifies the social benefit, but it's not what the argument is concerned with.
E: The claim is not the conclusion of the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The question is asking about the role played by the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously in the psychologist's argument.
The argument states that expressing gratitude is an important social function that reinforces positive behavior. It claims that this function can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude, i.e., gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously.
A: This option states that the claim is used to support the argument's conclusion, but the argument's conclusion is not explicitly mentioned and cannot be inferred from the claim alone.
B: This option states that the claim is used to counter an objection to the argument's conclusion, but no such objection is presented in the passage.
C: This option suggests that the claim indirectly supports another claim, which in turn supports the argument's conclusion, but no such chain of reasoning is presented in the passage.
D: This option suggests that the claim is used to identify the social benefit that the argument addresses, which is partly valid, but does not capture the full role of the claim in the argument.
E: This option suggests that the claim is the conclusion of the argument, which is incorrect. The claim is a premise used to support the argument's conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The psychologist argues that expressing gratitude cannot be done anonymously and that it plays an important social function of positively reinforcing beneficial behavior. Human psychology is driven by personal interaction.
A: Describes a premise that supports the conclusion, but the claim about gratitude is the conclusion.
B: The claim doesn't counter a consideration, but instead is used to support the argument's conclusion.
C: The claim is used to support the argument's conclusion directly.
D: The claim identifies the social benefit being discussed, but it doesn't fully describe the role it plays in the argument.
E: The claim is a premise in support of the conclusion, not the conclusion itself.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The psychologist argues that social reinforcement of beneficial behaviors cannot be fulfilled anonymously because human psychology is driven by personal interaction. Thus, the benefactor must know the source of the gratitude for social reinforcement to be effective.
  A: This choice is not accurate. The claim is not an illustration but a premise that the argument uses to support the conclusion.
  B: This choice is not accurate. The claim is not used to counter any specific consideration.
  C: This choice is not accurate. The claim is not used indirectly to support any claim that is used in turn to support the conclusion.
  D: This choice is partially accurate. The claim does identify a social benefit - that of reinforcing behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others. However, this alone does not accurately describe the role played by the claim in the argument.
  E: This choice is not accurate. The claim is not the conclusion of the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The psychologist argues that gratitude cannot be expressed anonymously, and the social function of positively reinforcing behaviors that benefit others can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of gratitude. 
  A: The claim does not illustrate a premise that supports the argument's conclusion; the statement argues for the claim.
  B: The claim is not used to counter a consideration that undermines the argument's conclusion; rather, it is part of the argument's premise.
  C: This choice is closer to the argument's structure, but it is not accurate since the claim does not indirectly support a claim used to support the argument's conclusion.
  D: The claim helps to identify the social benefit that the argument is concerned with, but it does not solely focus on that aspect.
  E: This is not accurate since the claim is not the conclusion of the argument. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The psychologist argues that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously because human psychology is still driven by personal interaction. Positive reinforcement of benefactor’s behavior is important and can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude. 
A: The claim is not an illustration of a premise, but rather a premise itself. It is used to support another premise and ultimately the conclusion.
B: The claim is not used to counter a claim that undermines the conclusion.
C: This choice is partly accurate, but it does not express the full relationship between the claim and the conclusion. The claim here is a premise.
D: This is incorrect. While the claim may identify a social benefit, that is not its primary role in the argument.
E: This is also incorrect. The claim is a premise, not the conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: 
The psychologist's argument is that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously because it is driven by personal interaction, and thus, the benefactor needs to know the source of the gratitude. This supports the conclusion that positively reinforcing behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude. 
Therefore, the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously supports indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion. Hence, the correct answer is C.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. So, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine?
Choices:
  A: All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water.
  B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
  C: A washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine.
  D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
  E: Washers that use more water get clothes cleaner than those that use less.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers because they use less water than top-loading washers. Therefore, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, you need to use detergent specifically formulated for it.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument made in the magazine.
  B: This statement is irrelevant because the argument is concerned with the effectiveness of detergent for front-loading washers, not top-loading washers.
  C: This statement does not support the argument in the consumer magazine.
  D: This statement supports the argument made in the consumer magazine regarding the effectiveness of laundry detergent in the washing machines.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument presented in the consumer magazine.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The argument in the consumer magazine is that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent. 
- The reason given is that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers as they use less water than top-loading washers.

Analysis:
- An assumption is a gap in the argument that needs to be filled in for the argument to be logically valid.
- Based on the argument presented in the consumer magazine, it seems that the assumption required would be related to why ordinary detergent does not work in front-loading washers while detergents specially formulated for front-loading washers do work.

A: The amount of water used by top-loading washers is not relevant to the argument in the consumer magazine.
B: The argument discusses the need for a detergent formulated for front-loading washers to dissolve more readily in a front-loading washer than ordinary powder detergent, not in top-loading washers.
C: This statement is too broad and not directly relevant to the argument being made in the consumer magazine.
D: This statement fills in the gap of why a detergent formulated especially for a type of washer works better than ordinary detergent. 
E: The argument in the consumer magazine is specific to front-loading washers and their water usage, so it is not relevant to the comparison of front-loading vs. top-loading washers.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the consumer magazine claims that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers due to their lower water usage, and that a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed to get clothes really clean.

A: The amount of water used by top-loading machines is unrelated to whether or not special detergent is needed in front-loading machines, therefore, this assumption is not required by the argument.
B: This statement is unrelated to the argument and is not required as an assumption.
C: While this statement could be true, it is not necessary to the argument that all washers need special detergent in order to get clothes clean.
D: This assumption is required by the argument because if ordinary detergent can get clothes "really clean", then there would be no need to use a special detergent formulated for front-loading washers.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument and is not required as an assumption.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers because they use less water, so a detergent specially formulated for front-loading washers is necessary. 
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument being made.
B: This statement does not need to be assumed for the argument to hold. 
C: This statement is also not necessary to make the argument.
D: This statement is necessary for the argument to hold true. 
E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument being made.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that "to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent"; therefore, the statement assumes that using a laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is necessary to clean clothes, i.e., it is an assumption the argument requires.
  A: The amount of water used in top-loading washing machines is not relevant to the argument of the consumer magazine. Thus, this choice is not the assumption required by the argument.
  B: The argument does not compare the properties of detergents for front-loading washers with those for top-loading washers. Thus, this choice is not the assumption required by the argument.
  C: This choice is not the assumption required by the argument. It is not necessary to state that a washing machine needs a specially formulated detergent in general. The argument is using a washing machine that uses low amounts of water.
  D: This choice is an assumption required by the argument. It states that a laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it. And the argument is that you need a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument made in the consumer magazine. Thus, this choice is not the assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the consumer magazine says that front-loading washers use less water and ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in them.
  It suggests using a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers instead of ordinary powder detergent.
A: All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water is not relevant to the argument.
B: The argument does not make any comparison between front-loading and top-loading washers regarding the dissolution of detergents.
C: The argument does not say that the need for a special detergent is unique to a particular kind of washer.
D: This statement is consistent with the argument in the consumer magazine.
E: The argument does not make any claim that more water leads to cleaner clothes or less water leads to less clean clothes. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is required to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine when compared to ordinary powder detergent, because ordinary detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading machines due to their low water usage.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about top-loading machines and not the front-loading machines in question.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the dissolvement of the front-loading detergent in top-loading machines and not in the intended front-loading machines in question.
  C: This statement could be an assumption but it doesn't fully support the argument in the passage because it is too broad. The argument in the passage is specifically only related to the use of a specific type of detergent for front-loading washing machines.
  D: This assumption supports the argument. The argument is that ordinary detergent does not dissolve readily and "to get clothes really clean" one needs a detergent that dissolves readily. This assumption states the same thing. 
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the association between the amount of water used and getting clothes cleaned, and it doesn't address the issue of detergents.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the consumer magazine claims that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers because they use less water than top-loading washers. So, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed. 
  A: The amount of water used by top-loading washing machines is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The argument in the consumer magazine does not discuss the dissolving differences between front-loading washers and top-loading washers as a factor of a laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers.
  C: This can be considered a claim/opinion not an assumption in the context of the argument.
  D: This assumption is required because the argument is based on the premise that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washing machines. 
  E: This is not directly relevant to the argument. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers instead of ordinary powder detergent to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine because ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers as they use less water than top-loading washers.
  A: This is not a necessary assumption for the argument in the consumer magazine.
  B: This is not a necessary assumption for the argument in the consumer magazine.
  C: This statement is not necessary for the argument in the consumer magazine although it might be true.
  D: This is a necessary assumption for the argument in the consumer magazine.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument in the consumer magazine.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers because they use less water than top-loading washers. Therefore, to clean clothes effectively in a front-loading machine, one must use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument presented.
  B: This statement is not required by the argument. It might be true, but the argument can still stand without it.
  C: This statement is too broad and extreme to be required by the argument. The argument suggests that for front-loading washers, a specially-formulated detergent is necessary, but it does not make a claim about all washing machines and all types of detergent.
  D: This statement is necessary for the argument. The argument suggests that using ordinary powder detergent in a front-loading washer does not get clothes as clean as detergent formulated for front-loading washers. Therefore, the assumption must be that the laundry detergent must dissolve readily in the washer to clean the clothes effectively.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument presented.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
Question: The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
  B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  C: My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house. Since anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it.
  D: My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Since no one who lives in a house both O'WIlS it and pays rent on it, it must be that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their heuse.
  E: Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Therefore, it must be that they pay rent on it.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he did not receive a raise. However, there could be other reasons why Lester did not get a raise. There is a flaw in the argument because it assumes that not getting a raise is an indication of having a poor performance evaluation, but there are other reasons why someone may not receive a raise.
  A: This argument is flawed because it concludes that my neighbors do not own their house because they pay rent on it, but it is possible that they pay rent to a bank or a landlord.
  B: This argument is also flawed because it concludes that my neighbors do not pay rent on their house because they own it, but they could rent out their house to tenants and still own it.
  C: This argument is flawed because it concludes that my neighbors own their house because they have not paid any rent on it, but it is possible that they own their house and do not charge themselves rent.
  D: This argument is flawed because it uses the same reasoning as the original argument, assuming that if someone owns a house they do not pay rent on it and if someone pays rent then they do not own.
  E: This argument is also flawed because it uses the same reasoning as the original argument, assuming that if someone does not own a house then they must pay rent, without considering other possibilities such as living with family or friends rent-free.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a conditional statement in the form of "No one who [condition A] has [action B]". It then presents a second conditional statement in the form of "Lester has not [action B], so it must be that he has [condition A]". This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that there are only two possible options for receiving a raise or a poor performance evaluation, which may not be the case.
  A: This argument is flawed for a different reason than the provided argument. The argument above takes two conditions and attempts to draw a conclusion based on their relationship. This argument takes a single condition and attempts to apply it to a relationship that is not stated.
  B: This argument is also flawed for a different reason. The argument above takes two conditions and attempts to draw a conclusion based on their relationship. This argument takes a single condition that is contradicted by the premise and draws a conclusion based on this contradiction.
  C: This argument is also flawed for a different reason. The argument above takes two conditions and attempts to draw a conclusion based on their relationship. This argument takes a single condition and draws a conclusion based on this condition without considering other possibilities.
  D: This argument is similar to the provided argument in that it presents a conditional statement in the form of "No one who [condition A] has [action B]". It then presents a second conditional statement in the form of "my next-door neighbors do not [action B], so it must be that they [condition A]". However, this argument is flawed for the same reason as the provided argument - it assumes that there are only two possible options for owning or renting a house.
  E: This argument is also flawed for a different reason. The argument above takes two conditions and attempts to draw a conclusion based on their relationship. This argument takes a single condition and draws a conclusion based on this condition without considering other possibilities. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument presented in the context is flawed because the conclusion reached is too strong. There could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise.
  A: This argument is an example of flawed reasoning, but it is not similar to the flawed argument in the context.
  B: This argument is an example of flawed reasoning, but it is not similar to the flawed argument in the context.
  C: This argument is an example of flawed reasoning, but it is not similar to the flawed argument in the context.
  D: This argument is an example of flawed reasoning, but it is not similar to the flawed argument in the context.
  E: This argument is similar to the flawed argument in the context in that it assumes that a single condition (not owning the house) automatically leads to the presence of another condition (paying rent on the house).
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is based on the conditional statement 'No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.'
  'Lester has not received a raise' is given as a premise in the argument, thus leading to the conclusion that 'Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation.'
  A: This argument follows the same structure as the original argument. The premise is 'No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it.' Then the conclusion is 'my next-door neighbors do not own it.'
  B: This argument follows a different structure than the original argument. The premise is 'No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it.' Then the conclusion is 'My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.'
  C: This argument follows a different structure than the original argument. The premise is 'My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house.' Then the conclusion is 'it must be that they own it.'
  D: This argument follows a similar structure to the original argument. However, the premise is 'My next-door neighbors do not own their house.' Then the conclusion is 'it must be that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house.'
  E: This argument follows a different structure than the original argument. The premise is 'Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it.' Then the conclusion is 'my next-door neighbors must pay rent on their house.'
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: The argument presents a conditional statement of the form "If A, then B". It then observes "not B" and concludes "not A". However, it is a faulty conclusion because there may be other reasons that could make "not B" true beside "A".
A: This argument uses the same "If A, then B" form and similar flawed reasoning as the main argument above. It concludes "not A" from observing "not B" without considering other possibilities that could make "not B" true.
B: This argument uses the same conditional "If A, then B" form, but it is not flawed as it concludes "not B" from observing "A" which is the correct conclusion.
C: This argument concludes "A" from observing "not B", which is different from the flawed reasoning used in the main argument above.
D: This argument uses the same conditional "If A, then B" form and similar flawed reasoning as the main argument above. It concludes "A" from observing "not B" without considering other possibilities that could make "not B" true.
E: This argument concludes "B" from observing "not A", which is different from the flawed reasoning used in the main argument above.
Action: Answer('A')
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument in the context is that a person who did not receive a raise must have received a poor performance evaluation, but this conclusion is not guaranteed; there could be other reasons why the person did not receive a raise.
  A: The argument assumes that owning a house and paying rent on a house are mutually exclusive, which may not be true in some cases.
  B: The argument assumes that owning a house and paying rent on a house are mutually exclusive, which may not be true in some cases.
  C: The argument concludes that the neighbors own their house based on the fact that they have not paid any rent, but there could be other reasons why they have not paid any rent.
  D: The argument assumes that owning a house and paying rent on a house are mutually exclusive, which may not be true in some cases. 
  E: The argument concludes that the neighbors pay rent on their house based on the fact that they do not own their house, but there could be other reasons why they do not own their house.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument in the context commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Specifically, it assumes that if p implies q, then if not-p, then not-q, which is not true in general.
    - Here, p is "received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise", and q is "works at Leila's Electronics".
    - So, the argument says if someone does not receive a raise (i.e., not-p), then that person must have received a poor performance evaluation (i.e., not-q).
  A: This argument commits the same fallacy as the argument in the context, because it also assumes that if p implies q, then if not-p, then not-q.
  B: This argument has the correct reasoning, because it affirms the consequent, which is a valid logical inference (i.e., if p implies q, and q is observed, then p can be inferred). So, it is different from the argument in the context.
  C: This argument commits the fallacy of denying the consequent, which is different from the argument in the context and also not a valid inference rule.
  D: This argument commits the same fallacy as the argument in the context and is therefore similar to it.
  E: This argument has the same structure as the argument in option C, and therefore commits the same fallacy as that option. So, it is different from the argument in the context.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument is based on the premise that no one at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise, and that Lester has not received a raise.
  A: The argument uses a similar structure of premises and conclusion. However, in this case, the premise states that no person can both own and pay rent on a house, and the conclusion is drawn that the neighbor does not own the house because they pay rent on it. This argument is flawed because it ignores the possibility that the neighbor may not live in the house with someone else renting it.
  B: This argument uses a similar structure of premises and conclusion. Here, the premise states that no one can both pay rent and own a house. The conclusion is drawn that because the neighbor owns their house, they must not pay rent. This argument is flawed because it ignores the possibility of other modes of payment such as a mortgage.
  C: This argument concludes that the neighbor owns the house since they have not paid any rent on it. However, the premise is also flawed and makes the assumption that anyone who lives in the house but does not rent it, owns it.
  D: This argument uses a similar approach to the previous arguments and concludes that the neighbor pays rent on their house because they do not own it. However, the premise is again based on the flawed assumption that no one who lives in a house both owns and pays rent on it.
  E: This argument uses a similar structure of premises and conclusions. Here the premise states that anyone who does not own their house pays rent on it and the neighbor does not own their house.  The conclusion is drawn that the neighbor pays rent on their house. This argument follows logically from the premises.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument provided is that if someone did not receive a raise, then they must have received a poor performance evaluation. However, this conclusion does not necessarily follow because there could be other reasons for not receiving a raise.
  A: This argument is flawed because it draws a conclusion based on the absence of evidence.
  B: This argument does not contain the same flaw as the original argument.
  C: This argument is flawed because it draws a conclusion based on the absence of evidence.
  D: This argument is flawed because it draws a conclusion based on the absence of evidence.
  E: This argument is flawed because it draws a conclusion based on the absence of evidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The argument provides a premise that anyone who works at Leila's Electronics has not received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. It also provides that Lester has not received a rise. The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation.
A: The argument provides a premise that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. It also provides that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house. The argument concludes that it must be that they do not own their house.
B: The argument provides a premise that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. It also provides that my next-door neighbors own their house. The argument concludes that it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
C: The argument provides a premise that anyone who lives in a house but does not pay rent, owns it. It also provides that my neighbors have not paid any rent. The argument concludes that they must own the house.
D: The argument provides a premise that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. It also provides that my next-door neighbors do not own their house. The argument concludes that it must be that they pay rent on their house.
E: The argument provides a premise that anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. It also provides that my next-door neighbors do not own their house. The argument concludes that it must be that they pay rent on their house.

Flawed reasoning: The argument uses the absence of one factor (in this case, a raise) to determine the presence of another factor (in this case, a poor performance evaluation). This jumps to a conclusion without providing a logical connection between the premise and the conclusion.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The principle mentioned above states that an offer is legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be serious and not made in jest. A contract is valid only if both parties accept a legitimate offer.
A: Joe made a legitimate offer which Sandy has not rejected, thus there is a valid contract. This argument is in line with the principle stated above.
B: Gus made an offer in jest that Kenta accepted, making the offer illegitimate. This argument is in line with the principle stated above.
C: Frank's offer may have been legitimate, but whether or not Mindy is a reasonable person is irrelevant to the validity of the contract. This argument is not in line with the principle stated above.
D: Hai's offer was such that no one in Lea's position could reasonably believe it was made in jest, so if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. This argument is in line with the principle stated above.
E: Whether or not Sal made the offer in jest is irrelevant; the only offer that Sal made was not legitimate, thus there is no valid contract. This argument is not specifically in line with the principle stated above.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other. An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

Action: Answer("B")

In choice B, Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus made the offer in jest. The principle stated above helps justify why the contract was not valid. That is, someone in Kenta's position would not have accepted Gus's offer if they believed it to be a joke. Therefore, the offer was not legitimate, and there was no valid contract.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The principle stated above outlines the concept of a legitimate offer, which is required for a contract to be valid. An offer is only legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made seriously and not in jest.
A: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above to reason that a legitimate offer was made and therefore a valid contract could be formed.
B: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above to reason that the offer was not legitimate and therefore there was no valid contract.
C: This argument does not apply the principle correctly and is instead making an assumption about Mindy's actions.
D: This argument applies the principle correctly to reason that if the offer was made in such a way that is was reasonable to believe it was serious, then a valid contract could be formed.
E: This argument is not related to the principle stated above and therefore does not apply it correctly.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
A: The argument is valid because it explains that a contract can be valid only if a legitimate offer is accepted by one party.
B: The argument is valid because it explains that a contract may not be valid if the offer is considered to be made in jest by someone in the position of the party to whom it was made.
C: This statement is incorrect, as a reasonable person's acceptance of an offer does not in itself make the offer legitimate.
D: The argument is valid because it explains that a contract can be valid if an offer is not considered to be made in jest by someone in the position of the party to whom it was made.
E: The argument is not valid because it simply states that there is no valid contract, without considering whether the offer was legitimate or not.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

A: The argument cited states that Joe made a legitimate offer to Sandy to buy her car and Sandy has not yet rejected it. This justification does not indicate whether someone in Sandy's position can or cannot perceive the offer as a jest. Thus this argument cannot be justified by the principle mentioned in the context.
B: The argument cited states that Kenta accepted an offer to buy goods from Gus but Gus made the offer in jest. This rejection by Kenta seems to be consistent with the principle stated above. Thus this argument can be justified by the principle mentioned in the context.
C: The argument cited does not specify whether Mindy accepts or rejects Frank's offer. This justification does not indicate whether someone in Mindy's position can or cannot perceive the offer as a jest. Thus this argument cannot be justified by the principle mentioned in the context.
D: The argument cited states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was done in such a way that no one in Lea's position would perceive it as a jest. This justification seems to be consistent with the principle mentioned in the context. Thus this argument can be justified by the principle mentioned in the context.
E: The argument cites that Sal's only offer to Veronica was not legitimate. This justification does not indicate whether someone in Veronica's position can or cannot perceive the offer as a jest. Thus this argument cannot be justified by the principle mentioned in the context.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  
A: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above to justify the reasoning that there was a valid contract if a legitimate offer is made and there is no rejection.
B: This argument applies the principle in the opposite way. The principle states that if someone would reasonably believe an offer is made in jest, the offer is not legitimate and therefore the contract is not valid. So, this argument uses the principle to justify that the contract was not valid, not valid.
C: This argument does not apply the principle correctly as it does not take into account whether the offer is legitimate or not based on the position of the party to whom it was made.
D: This argument correctly applies the principle stated above to justify the reasoning that if an offer is not made in jest and the recipient accepts it, then a valid contract is formed.
E: This argument is not relevant as it only talks about an offer that was not legitimate, regardless of whether it is made in jest or not.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The principle given above states that for a contract between two parties to be valid, an offer must be legitimate, meaning someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would not reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
A: This argument correctly applies the principle. If Joe's offer was legitimate and Sandy has not rejected the offer, there is a valid contract, according to the principle.
B: This argument correctly applies the principle. Since Gus made the offer in jest and Kenta accepted it without knowing, according to the principle, the contract was not valid.
C: This argument's reasoning is flawed. Frank's offer may be legitimate, but that does not mean that Mindy will accept it. The principle given does not support the conclusion.
D: This argument correctly applies the principle. If no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed Hai's offer to be a jest and Lea accepts the offer, then there is a valid contract.
E: This argument is not related to the principle given; its reasoning is not valid.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
A: This argument is valid, but it does not rely on the principle stated above.
B: This argument is consistent with the principle stated above, which requires that the offer be legitimate in order for the contract to be valid.
C: This argument is not entirely valid since the reasonableness of Mindy's acceptance does not depend solely on the legitimacy of Frank's offer, but rather on various factors that may influence her decision.
D: This argument is consistent with the principle stated above, which requires that the offer be legitimate and reasonable in order for the contract to be valid.
E: This argument is not well-supported by the principle stated above since the validity of an offer does not depend solely on whether or not it is legitimate. Whether the offer was made in jest is not the only factor that determines its legitimacy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
The principle states that a contract is valid only if there is a legitimate offer which is accepted by the other party. Additionally, if the offer is believed to be made in jest, it is not considered legitimate.

A: This statement is consistent with the principle stated above. If there is a legitimate offer and it is not rejected, there is a valid contract.
B: This statement is also consistent with the principle stated above, as the offer was not legitimate since it was made in jest.
C: This statement is not consistent with the principle stated above, as the principle does not indicate that an offer would be necessarily accepted by the other party even if it was legitimate.
D: This statement is consistent with the principle stated above, as since the offer was not made in jest, there is a legitimate offer; if Lea accepts, then there would be a valid contract.
E: This statement does not take into account the principle stated above since it only asserts that the only offer made was not a legitimate one.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  A contract is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  
A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract. 
  - This argument is supported if Sandy did not believe the offer was made in jest.
  - The principle in the context applies to ensure that the offer is legitimate.
  - Therefore, this argument reflects the principle in the context.
  
B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  - This argument shows that the offer was made in jest.
  - The principle in the context applies because the offer is not legitimate.
  - Therefore, this argument reflects the principle in the context.
  
C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  - This argument does not relate to the principle in the context.
  - The argument does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  - Therefore, this argument does not reflect the principle in the context.
  
D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  - This argument shows that the offer was not made in jest.
  - The principle in the context applies because the offer is legitimate.
  - Therefore, this argument reflects the principle in the context.
  
E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
  - This argument shows that the offer was not legitimate.
  - However, the principle in the context applies to distinguish legitimate from non-legitimate offers.
  - Therefore, this argument reflects the principle in the context.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

  It says that both kinds of horror stories have two characteristics in common: that they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  A: The passage does not suggest that "all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature." It only suggests that in some stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. 
  B: The passage suggests that both kinds of horror stories are intended to produce dread in the reader, but it does not say that "any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader." 
  C: The passage does not suggest that "horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed." It only suggests that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. 
  D: The passage suggests that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, but it does not say that "most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views." 
  E: The passage suggests that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature, and it suggests that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. So, it is possible that "some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature."
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that horror stories of both types describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  A: The passage mentions that some horror stories about monstrous beasts may represent a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, but it does not state that all such stories must include such a depiction, nor does it suggest that descriptions of monstrous beasts always violate the laws of nature.
  B: The passage states that both kinds of horror stories are intended to produce dread in the reader, but it does not say that every story that describes a violation of the laws of nature has this intention.
  C: The passage suggests that some horror stories about monstrous beasts may involve psychologically disturbed characters, but it does not make any claims about horror stories of any kind having usually having this feature.
  D: The passage suggests that horror stories about mad scientists often imply that pure scientific knowledge cannot guide human endeavor, but it does not claim that most such stories express an antiscientific sentiment.
  E: The passage does not explicitly state that stories that employ symbolism necessarily describe violations of the laws of nature, nor does it suggest that all stories that describe such violations use symbolism.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: When surveyed about which party they would like to see in the legislature, 40 percent of respondents said Conservative, 20 percent said Moderate, and 40 percent said Liberal. If the survey results are reliable, we can conclude that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses premises about the actual state of affairs to draw a conclusion about how matters should be.
  B: The argument draws a conclusion that merely restates a premise presented in favor of it.
  C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  D: The argument fails to consider that the survey results might have been influenced by the political biases of the researchers who conducted the survey.
  E: The argument uses evidence that supports only rough estimates to draw a precisely quantified conclusion.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents survey results to draw a conclusion.
  A: The argument does not suggest how things should be, it only suggests what most citizens want.
  B: The argument does not only restate the premise, it draws a conclusion based on the premise.
  C: The argument does not assume that group's preferences are the same as individual preferences.
  D: The argument does not discuss any biases of the researchers who conducted the survey.
  E: The argument does make a precise conclusion based on rough estimates.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument presented relies on a survey to conclude that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40% Conservative, 20% Moderate, and 40% Liberal.
  A: This is not a flaw in the reasoning in this argument.
  B: This is not a flaw in the reasoning in this argument.
  C: This reasoning assumes that the preferences of a group as a whole reflect the preferences of most individual members of the group. This is a flaw in the reasoning in this argument.
  D: This argument presents no evidence to suggest that the survey results were influenced by the political biases of the researchers who conducted the survey. This is not a flaw in the reasoning in this argument.
  E: The conclusion of this argument is not precisely quantified; the argument concludes only that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40% Conservative, 20% Moderate, and 40% Liberal, which supports rough estimates and does not necessarily require precise quantification. This is not a flaw in the reasoning in this argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument presents a survey result about the preference of respondents regarding the political parties.
  A: This does not appear to be a flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
  B: The conclusion of the argument does not merely restate a premise presented in favor of it.
  C: There is a possibility that this conclusion might not hold because different individuals in the group could have different preferences.
  D: There is no information presented in the argument which supports the claim that the survey is influenced by political biases of researchers.
  E: The conclusion of the argument is merely a rough estimate based on the survey results.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument assumes that the preferences of the respondents about Conservative, Moderate, and Liberal political parties reflect how the legislature composition should be.
  A: The argument is not using premises about the actual state of affairs to draw a conclusion about how matters should be. The argument is using preferences to make a conclusion about composition.
  B: The argument does not draw a conclusion that merely restates a premise presented in favor of it.
  C: The argument is assuming that the percentage of the groups who prefer each political party aligns with the percentage of the citizens who prefer each political party. However, this may not be a valid assumption, as many individual citizens may have preferences that vary from the group averages.
  D: The argument does not consider the possibility of research bias.
  E: The conclusion is roughly quantified while the original data is precisely quantified.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument is based on survey results about the preferences of a group of people towards political parties.
A: The argument does not present any premise about how matters should be, so this choice is not the best answer.
B: The argument does not restate any premise, so this choice is not the best answer.
C: The argument uses the preferences of the respondents as evidence for drawing a conclusion about the preferences of the group as a whole, which is not necessarily valid. The preferences of individuals may differ from the preferences of the group to which they belong.
D: The argument assumes the survey results to be reliable without considering the possibility of any research bias. However, this possible bias does not necessarily constitute a flaw in the argument's reasoning.
E: The argument uses rough estimates from the survey to draw a precisely quantified conclusion, which is not necessarily valid. The survey results might not be representative of the general population and the conclusion might not reflect their actual preferences.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The researcher compared joggers who stretch before jogging to joggers who do not stretch before jogging and found no difference in injury rates.
  A: The premise states that both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries. The comparison is between the two groups.
  B: Previous injuries suffered by joggers will probably affect stretching, but they will not affect the conclusion that stretching does not prevent injuries.
  C: The argument does not relate to the causes of jogging injuries.
  D: This choice suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries are more likely to stretch before jogging. But it does not provide evidence to counter the researcher's conclusion.
  E: This statement relates to the question of whether stretching can reduce the severity of injuries, rather than whether stretching can prevent injuries.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The researcher compared a group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal group of joggers who do not stretch before jogging.
- Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
- The conclusion drawn by the researcher is that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries.

Action: Answer("E")  

Explanation: 
- Answer choice A does not address the impact of stretching on injury prevention, but rather is a contextual point that does not impact the conclusion of the researcher. 
- Answer choice B may allow for alternative explanations for why stretching did not prevent injuries, but it does not necessarily disprove the conclusion reached. 
- Answer choice C suggests that most injuries from jogging are not prevented by stretching, but it also does not weaken the researcher's argument in favor of stretching. 
- Answer choice D presents a correlation, but again does not address the conclusion of the researcher.
- The reason why stretching did not prevent jogging injuries may simply depend on the type of exercise in question, so answer choice E which presents evidence that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain types of exercise, weakens the researcher's conclusion suggesting that stretching prior to jogging is not effective for injury prevention.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries based on a comparison of joggers who stretch before jogging and those who do not stretch before jogging.
  
  A: This statement provides evidence that the joggers included in the study were less prone to jogging injuries than joggers not included in the study. This does not have any direct bearing on whether stretching before jogging prevents injuries or not.
  B: This statement suggests that the joggers who have been injured before may have had difficulty in performing stretches. This raises a possible explanation for the lack of difference in injury rates between the two groups of joggers.
  C: This statement suggests that most jogging injuries are caused by mishaps that stretching would have little if any effect on. This raises a possible explanation for the lack of difference in injury rates between the two groups of joggers.
  D: This statement suggests that joggers who are more prone to jogging injuries may have a stronger motivation to perform stretches before jogging. This does not have any direct bearing on whether stretching before jogging prevents injuries or not.
  E: This statement provides evidence that for certain forms of exercise stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that specific exercise. The relevance of this statement to jogging is unclear.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries since both groups of joggers, the ones who stretched before jogging and the ones who did not stretch, had roughly the same number of injuries.
A: This statement could support the researcher's argument, by showing that the overall rate of jogging injuries is higher and hence can't be avoided much through stretching.
B: This statement states that many joggers previously injured experience difficulty in performing stretches, which could affect their injuries later. Hence, this could be a point to weaken the researcher's argument.
C: This statement gives reasons why stretching does not help but it does not challenge the medical researcher's argument regarding two groups having the same number of injuries.
D: This statement is out of context, and it doesn't address the issue of the argument.
E: This statement is outside the scope of the argument; the argument only talks about jogging.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. Both groups of joggers who were compared (those who stretched before jogging vs those who did not stretch before jogging) incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
A: This choice does not weaken the medical researcher's argument.
B: This choice suggests that some joggers who were previously injured incurred difficulty stretching. However, it does not necessarily weaken the medical researcher's argument.
C: This choice suggests that most jogging injuries are caused by mishaps unrelated to stretching. Therefore, it weakens the medical researcher's argument that stretching does not help to prevent injuries.
D: This choice provides information about the relationship between developing the habit of stretching and the likelihood of developing jogging injuries. However, it does not necessarily weaken the medical researcher's argument.
E: This choice suggests that stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise. However, it does not necessarily weaken the medical researcher's argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries specifically in joggers.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. This conclusion is based on the fact that both groups of joggers, one stretching before jogging and one not stretching, incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
A: This statement does not weaken the medical researcher's argument as both groups had the same rate of injuries.
B: This statement talks about the difficulty to perform stretches for those who were previously injured and does not directly challenge the researcher's argument.
C: This statement suggests that stretching may not help in preventing falls, collisions, and other mishaps but we do not know if the injuries recorded in this study resulted from such mishaps or other reasons.
D: If joggers who are more prone to injuries perform stretches before jogging, then the fact that both groups had the same number of injuries may not be due to the lack of effectiveness of stretching, but rather the habit of stretching already being developed in those who are injury-prone.
E: This statement explicitly suggests that stretching beforehand may help reduce injury severity for certain exercise forms which counters the researcher's argument. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries. 
  A: This strengthens the medical researcher's argument because both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries, even though the injuries rate overall was lower.
  B: This suggests that stretching may be beneficial but the joggers had difficulty performing it, so it weakens the medical researcher's argument.
  C: This suggests that stretching may not be helpful at preventing injuries, thus supports the medical researcher's argument.
  D: This suggests that those who perform stretching before jogging are actually more prone to injury, which supports the medical researcher's argument.
  E: This suggests that stretching might be beneficial but only for certain forms of exercise, thus it is irrelevant to the medical researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: Researchers compared a group of joggers who normally do the stretching before jogging with an equivalent group of joggers who do not stretch before jogging to conclude that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
A: This statement does not weaken the argument as it suggests that the sample groups had lower rates of jogging injuries. This statement does not comment on stretching and jogging.
B: This option if true, supports the argument. If injured joggers were unable to stretch, this would not show the effectiveness of stretching.
C: This option if true, would support the argument. If most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps, stretching would have little or no effect. 
D: This option if true, would weaken the argument as it suggests that experienced joggers who have a habit of stretching still incur injuries.
E: This option if true, would weaken the argument as it suggests that stretching beforehand might reduce the severity of injuries resulting from jogging and would contradict the comparison made by the researchers.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The researcher compared joggers who stretch before jogging to joggers who don't stretch before jogging to evaluate the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries.
  Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  
  A: This fact would not necessarily have an effect on the researcher's argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  B: If injuries experienced while performing stretches negatively affected the jogger's ability to stretch effectively, this would weaken the researcher's argument that stretching doesn't prevent injuries.
  C: If most jogging injuries don't result from issues that are addressed by stretching, this would weaken the researcher's argument that stretching doesn't prevent injuries.
  D: If prone joggers develop a habit of stretching before jogging to reduce their likelihood of injury, it would weaken the researcher's argument that stretching doesn't prevent injuries.
  E: This fact is irrelevant to the researcher's comparison of joggers who stretch before jogging to joggers who don't stretch before jogging.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The medical researcher argued that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries. 
  A: This statement provides additional information but does not directly weaken the researcher's argument. 
  B: This statement indirectly indicates that stretching does not cause injuries, but it does not directly weaken the researcher's argument.
  C: This statement suggests that most jogging injuries are not related to stretching, which weakens the researcher's argument.
  D: This statement suggests that stretching is a habit developed by those who are prone to injuries, and there may be other factors that contribute to injuries. This weakens the researcher's argument.
  E: This statement suggests that stretching can reduce injury severity for some forms of exercise. This statement does not directly weaken the researcher's argument.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument above presents a flawed pattern of reasoning by concluding that one group must be larger than another based solely on the fact that more members of the first group are included in a certain category than members of the second group.
  A: The flawed pattern of reasoning in this argument is similar to the argument above because it concludes that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays based solely on the fact that most of the paintings on display are from that century.
  B: This argument presents flawed pattern of reasoning by concluding that the opinion of all Silver Falls residents can be inferred from the opinion of those who participated in the poll.
  C: This argument presents flawed pattern of reasoning by concluding that the proportion of trees in the arboretum means there are more trees of one species in the area.
  D: This argument presents flawed pattern of reasoning by concluding that the number of organic vegetables available at one store is greater than the number available at another store based solely on the fact that more are offered at one than at the other.
  E: This argument presents flawed pattern of reasoning by concluding that more houses than condominiums are for sale based solely on the fact that photos are available for most of the houses but fewer than half of the condominiums.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The argument makes an assumption based on the probability that the number of enrolled sociology majors exceeds the number of psychology majors in the class despite having less information about the total number of students in each major. 
A: This flawed reasoning involves patterns of ownership of paintings and their display in the museum.
B: This flawed reasoning involves assumptions about analyzing opinion polls.
C: This flawed reasoning includes statements regarding the composition of local trees rather than the comparison of groups.
D: This flawed reasoning involves assumptions about the availability of vegetables.
E: This flawed reasoning involves assumptions about the availability of houses and condominiums.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that since most sociology majors are taking the class and most psychology majors are not, there must be a greater number of sociology majors. This does not necessarily hold true.
A: The argument in A is flawed because it assumes that if most paintings on display at the museum are from the twentieth century, there must be few if any from the nineteenth century.
B: The argument in B is flawed because it assumes that those who did not express a preference were not in favor of either option, or that those who agreed with spending more on one option did not also agree with spending more on the other option.
C: The argument in C is flawed because it assumes that the only possible explanation for most trees in the arboretum being local species is that there must be more local trees than exotic trees in the area. 
D: The argument in D is flawed because it assumes that just because most of the vegetables at one store are organic, and most at another store are not, more organic vegetables are available at the former store.
E: The argument in E is flawed because it assumes that just because the Acme Realty website has photos of most houses and fewer than half of the condominiums, there must be more houses than condominiums for sale.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The argument assumes that just because most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology and most of the psychology majors are not taking the same course, there must be more sociology majors enrolled in the course than psychology majors. This assumption is flawed since the argument does not provide any concrete evidence about the total number of sociology and psychology majors enrolled in class. 

A: This argument has an assumption that is flawed similar to the original argument. It assumes that just because most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, there are few, if any, of the twentieth-century paintings owned by the museum. However, there is no evidence that the museum's collection of paintings is the same as the ones on public display.

B: This argument also has an assumption similar to the original argument. It assumes that just because more people said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than on parks, most Silver Falls residents are in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks. This assumption is flawed since the opinion poll may not have included all Silver Falls residents, and there may be residents who support increased spending on both roads and parks.

C: This argument has a similar format to the original argument, but it has a valid assumption. It assumes that just because most of the trees in the San Felipe city arboretum are of local rather than exotic species, there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species in the San Felipe area.

D: This argument also follows a similar format, but the assumption made is valid. It assumes that just because most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, there must be more organic vegetables available at Valley Food than at Jumbo.

E: This argument has a flawed assumption that is most similar to the original argument. It assumes that just because the Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses but of fewer than half of the condominiums that Acme is offering for sale, Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The author is arguing that there are more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class solely based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class but most of the psychology majors are not.

A: The conclusion that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays is based solely on the premise of the high percentage of the twentieth-century paintings on display. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning in a similar way to the argument above.

B: Similar to the argument above, the conclusion is based solely on the premise of the high percentage of the residents who favor increased spending on roads.

C: The premise is the distribution of tree species at the San Felipe city arboretum and the conclusion is about the number of trees in the San Felipe area based on that distribution.

D: The argument is about the relative availability of organic vegetables at two different stores based on the percentage of organic vegetables available at each. 

E: The argument concludes that Acme has more houses than condominiums for sale based solely on the fact that photos of most of the houses are available on the website but photos of fewer than half of the condominiums are available.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presented is flawed.
  A: The argument in choice A makes an assumption that is not necessarily true, but it is not the same as the flaw in the original argument.
  B: The argument in choice B makes the same mistake as the original argument by assuming that a majority in one group implies a majority in another.
  C: The argument in choice C also makes the same mistake of assuming that a majority in one group implies a majority in another.
  D: The argument in choice D, like the original argument, assumes that the proportion of one group (organic vegetables) in a certain store implies a greater overall proportion in that category.
  E: The argument in choice E is similarly flawed by assuming that the proportion of one category on a website implies a greater overall proportion in that category. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument at Morris University assumes that the ratio of sociology majors to psychology majors enrolled in the class is the same as the ratio of sociology majors to psychology majors at the university. This is not necessarily true.
  A: The argument assumes that there is no overlap between the twentieth-century paintings the museum owns and the paintings it displays, which is not necessarily true.
  B: The argument assumes that those who did not respond to the opinion poll had the same opinions as those who did respond, which is not necessarily true.
  C: The argument assumes that the arboretum is representative of the San Felipe area, which is not necessarily true.
  D: The argument assumes that the types and quantities of vegetables available at each store are the same, which is not necessarily true.
  E: The argument assumes that there is no overlap between the houses and condominiums that Acme is offering for sale, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class while most of the psychology majors are not. This conclusion is not necessarily true as the total number of students in the class and the enrollment numbers from other majors has not been taken into account.
  A: The flawed reasoning is assuming that the museum could not simultaneously own both nineteenth-century and twentieth-century paintings.
  B: The flawed reasoning is assuming that those who did not express their preference in the poll do not have an opinion on spending on roads or parks.
  C: The flawed reasoning is inferring the proportion of the two species of trees in San Felipe area based on the local species in the arboretum.
  D: The flawed reasoning is inferring that Valley Food Co-op has more organic vegetables solely based on the fact that most of the vegetables available at the co-op are organic, without taking into account the total number of vegetables that each store offers.
  E: The flawed reasoning is assuming that the houses and condominiums are roughly equally available for sale, when it is possible that there are many more condominiums than houses for sale.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument above assumes that just because most of one group is doing something, that means there are more of that group than any other group in the class.
  A: The argument is similar in that it assumes just because more of one thing is displayed, that means there are few if any of the other thing. 
  B: The argument is similar in that it assumes just because more people are in favor of one thing, that means most of the people hold a specific set of views. 
  C: The argument is similar in that it assumes just because there are more trees of one type, that means most of the trees in the area are of that type. 
  D: The argument is similar in that it assumes just because most of one type of vegetable is available at one store, that means there are more of that type of vegetable at that store than any other store. 
  E: This argument is different from the flawed reasoning in the original argument as it does not make an assumption based on the proportion of the photos on the website. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above presents a flawed pattern of reasoning in order to draw a conclusion based on incomplete and insufficient evidence.
  A: The argument discusses the proportion of paintings on display vs. owned by a museum.
  B: The argument draws a conclusion about people's opinions by solely referring to an opinion poll.
  C: The argument presents a conclusion regarding the arboretum trees based on the proportion of local and exotic trees.
  D: The argument discusses the proportion of organic vegetables available at two different stores.
  E: The argument concludes that there are more houses for sale than condos based on the available pictures on a website.

Topic: Law
Context: Scholar: Recently, some religions have updated the language of their traditional texts and replaced traditional rituals with more contemporary ones. These changes have been followed by increases in attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions. This shows that any such modernization will result in increased numbers of worshipers.
Question: The scholar's reasoning is flawed because the scholar presumes without giving sufficient justification that
Choices:
  A: not every religion can update its texts and replace its traditional rituals
  B: modernization of religious texts and rituals will not involve an alteration of their messages
  C: the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance
  D: making texts and rituals more modern is the only way in which a religion could bring about an increase in attendance at places of worship
  E: the growth in attendance at places of worship affiliated with religions that made their texts and rituals more modern is irreversible
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The scholar believes that modernizing the language of traditional religious texts and replacing traditional rituals with more contemporary ones leads to an increase in attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the flaw in the scholar's reasoning. The scholar does not discuss the ability of religions to update their texts or update their rituals, but rather the effect of the update.
  B: The scholar does not address whether messages of religious texts and rituals are altered in the modernization process.
  C: This is a reasonable assumption made by the scholar that the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
  D: This is not relevant to the flaw in the scholar's reasoning. The scholar does not discuss alternatives ways for a religion to increase the attendance at their places of worship, if any.
  E: The scholar does not address whether the growth in attendance at places of worship affiliated with religions that made their texts and rituals more modern is irreversible.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The scholar argues that updating the language of traditional texts and replacing traditional rituals with contemporary ones has led to increased attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions. 
  A: The argument does not discuss the ability of any particular religion to update its texts and rituals.
  B: The argument does not state or imply that the messages of the religious texts and rituals will remain unaltered.
  C: The argument supports that the modernization of texts and rituals by some religions is correlated to the increase in attendance at their places of worship. However, it doesn't provide conclusive evidence that the modernization is the cause of the increase in attendance.
  D: The argument does not suggest that making religious texts and rituals more modern is the only way to increase attendance at places of worship.
  E: The argument does not provide sufficient evidence or reasoning to support the idea that such growth in attendance is irreversible.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The scholar argues that updating the language of traditional texts and replacing traditional rituals with more contemporary ones increase attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions. The scholar presumes that such modernization is the cause for increased numbers of worshipers.

A: This choice is not relevant to the argument of the scholar and it is not identified as a reason for the scholar's flaw in reasoning. 
B: This choice is also not relevant to the scholar's argument because the alteration of messages is not mentioned in the argument.
C: This statement represents the core of the scholar's argument; however, the causal relationship is not proved or supported with evidence in the argument.
D: This choice is not relevant to the scholar's argument.
E: This choice is incorrect because the argument doesn't provide any evidence on the irreversibility of the growth in attendance at places of worship.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The scholar argues that the updating of traditional texts and substitution of contemporary rituals by certain religions resulted in a surge in the number of people attending places of worship and therefore, any modernization will lead to an increase in worshippers. To evaluate the scholar's argument it is necessary to consider the reasons why there is an increase in attendance in places of worship affiliated with certain religions that have made their texts and rituals more modern.  
A: The option that every religion can update its texts and rituals is an assumption that the scholar does not make or require in their argument. This option is out of context and irrelevant to this argument. 
B: The scholar does not presume the messages of religious texts and rituals did not change during modernization and also does not need to discuss the possible alterations in the message for his argument. Hence, this option is not relevant and can be eliminated.
C: The option makes sense. It questions the causal relationship between modernization and the increase in attendance. The scholar assumes that the increase in attendance at some places of worship is caused by the update rather than the other way around. Thus, this can be a possible challenge to the scholar's reasoning.
D: This option does not have any relevance to the scholar's argument. The scholar does not assume that modernization is the only way in which a religion could bring about growth in attendance.
E: The option suggests that the growth in attendance at places of worship is irreversible. However, this idea is not stated in the scholar's argument. Therefore, this option is not relevant to the scholar's argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The scholar argues that there is a relationship between updating the language of traditional texts and replacing traditional rituals with more contemporary ones. This relationship is shown to lead to increased attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions. The argument asserts a cause-and-effect relationship between the two events.
  A: This fact is irrelevant to the argument made by the scholar.
  B: This aspect of the argument has not been addressed by the scholar and is not relevant to their reasoning.
  C: This statement is the premise upon which the scholar bases their argument.
  D: The argument advanced by the scholar is based on the assumption that all religions that modernize their text and ritual will experience an increase in attendance at their places of worship.
  E: This fact is irrelevant to the argument made by the scholar.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The scholar argues that modernization of religious texts and rituals have resulted in increased attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions. The correctness of this argument shall depend on how well the premises support the conclusion.

A: The given argument does not depend on this assumption. Hence, this option can be eliminated.
B: The given argument does not talk about the alteration of messages of religious texts and rituals, so this option can also be eliminated.
C: This aligns with the given argument where the attendance at places of worship affiliated with religions that modernized their texts and rituals increased, but it is not the only cause. This option is just a specific instance and, hence, incorrect.
D: The given argument does not assert that making texts and rituals more modern is the only way in which a religion could bring about an increase in attendance at places of worship. So, this option can be eliminated.
E: The given argument does not talk about the irreversibility of the growth in attendance at places of worship affiliated with religions that made their texts and rituals more modern. This option cannot be inferred from the given argument. Hence, this option can be eliminated.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument suggests a causal relationship between modernization of religious texts and rituals and an increase in attendance at places of worship.
  A: This option is not relevant to the argument, and it does not address the causal relationship between modernization and increased attendance.
  B: This option is also not relevant to the argument and it also does not address the causal relationship between modernization and increased attendance.
  C: This option is the premise on which the argument is based, and it recognizes a cause-and-effect relationship between modernization and increased attendance. Therefore, this is not the flaw in the argument.
  D: This option is also not relevant to the argument, and it does not address the causal relationship between modernization and increased attendance.
  E: This option is not relevant to the argument, and it does not address the causal relationship between modernization and increased attendance.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The argument states that modernization of traditional texts and rituals of some religions led to an increase in attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions, and hence concludes that any such modernization will result in increased numbers of worshipers. 
  A: The argument does not imply this. 
  B: The argument does not imply this. 
  C: The argument supports this. Hence, this cannot be the flaw. 
  D: The argument does not suggest this. 
  E: The argument does not imply this. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The argument stated above presents an explanation that modernizing traditional religious texts and rituals will lead to an increase of worshipers.
A: This implies that there are religions that cannot update their texts or replace their traditional rituals. However, the argument does not suggest or imply that. This choice is irrelevant to the argument and can be eliminated.
B: This choice assumes that altering the message of the religious texts and rituals is required for its modernization, which is not necessarily true. This does not challenge the author's line of thought and can be eliminated.
C: This is a reasonable explanation for the increase in attendance at places of worship. As it directly supports the conclusion of the author, it is not the flaw in the author's reasoning. Can be eliminated.
D: The author doesn't preclude other ways in which a religion could bring about an increase in attendance at places of worship. Hence this choice doesn't reflect the flaw in the author's reasoning and can be eliminated.
E: The argument does not support the idea that the growth in attendance is irreversible. It is also not essential to the argument to consider whether the attendance is reversible or irreversible. Therefore, this choice is irrelevant to the flaw of the author's reasoning and can be eliminated.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The scholar is making an argument that modernizing religious texts and rituals will result in increased attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions.

### Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Whether or not one can rightfully call a person's faithfulness a virtue depends in part on the object of that personas faithfulness. Virtues are by definition praiseworthy, which is why no one considers resentment virtuous, even though it is in fact a kind of faithfulness-faithfulness to hatreds or animosities.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous.
  B: Virtuous behavior is praiseworthy by definition.
  C: Behavior that emerges from hatred or animosity cannot be called virtuous.
  D: Faithfulness and resentment are obviously different, despite some similarities.
  E: Resentment should not be considered a virtuous emotion.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument states that whether faithfulness can be called a virtue or not depends on the object of the person's faithfulness. The example of resentment is given to further support the idea that faithfulness to some objects is not praiseworthy or virtuous. Therefore, the most accurate conclusion drawn from the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A expresses this conclusion more accurately than the other choices.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The overall conclusion of the argument is that whether or not faithfulness is a virtue depends, in part, on the object of that faithfulness. The argument provides examples of some objects that would not be considered praiseworthy (i.e., hatred and animosity), but it does not suggest that resentment "should not be considered a virtuous emotion" (choice E). Finally, while the argument does note that virtues are praiseworthy (choice B), that point is really just part of the definition of "virtue" and does not capture the conclusion of the argument as a whole.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge: The argument talks about how the object of faithfulness partially determines its virtue. It also mentions how only virtuous behavior is praiseworthy and how faithfulness to hatreds or animosities is not virtuous. 

Explanation: The overall conclusion drawn in the argument is that the virtue of faithfulness depends partially on its object. This conclusion is supported by the example of faithfulness to hatreds and animosities not being considered virtuous. Hence, the correct answer is A. B is discussed in the argument but it doesn't represent the overall conclusion of the argument. C and E are partially true but don't accurately convey the overall conclusion of the argument. D might be true, but it does not conclude the argument.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument is discussing whether faithfulness can be considered a virtue and argues that it partially depends on the object of the faithfulness. Therefore, choice A best summarizes the overall conclusion of the argument. Choice B is too narrow and only discusses one aspect of the larger argument. Choice C correctly identifies one example, but it is not the overall conclusion drawn. Choice D is incorrect since the argument acknowledges the similarities between faithfulness and resentment, and only argues against calling resentment virtuous. Choice E is too narrow and only focuses on one aspect of the overall argument.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The author's main point is that whether or not a person's faithfulness can be considered virtuous depends on the object of that faithfulness; and that virtues are defined by praiseworthy behavior. The argument states that being faithful to hatred is not virtuous, even though it is a kind of faithfulness. This supports the idea that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Therefore, the choice that most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument is A. The other choices are either too narrow, too broad, or not supported by the argument.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses how the virtuousness of a person's faithfulness is determined by the target of that faithfulness. It explains that virtues are praiseworthy, and the object of faithfulness partially determines whether or not faithfulness is a virtue. The example of resentment is used to illustrate how even though it involves a kind of faithfulness, it is not virtuous. Therefore, "The object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous" best expresses the overall conclusion.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The conclusion of the argument is that the object of a person's faithfulness is a determining factor in whether that faithfulness can be considered virtuous, as opposed to faithfulness in itself being a virtue. This is reflected in option A, which states that "The object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous." The other options either overstate or do not accurately reflect the conclusion drawn in the argument.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument discusses how virtues are praiseworthy, and how faithfulness to certain objects can determine whether or not it is virtuous. The argument then provides an example of resentment to show that faithfulness to certain objects is not always considered virtuous. Hence, the overall conclusion is that the object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Choice A best captures this conclusion.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")

Knowledge:
The argument talks about the relationship between faithfulness and virtuousness, and how this depends on the object of that faithfulness. The author also mentions that virtues are praiseworthy, but resentment (faithfulness to hatreds or animosities) is not considered virtuous.

Analysis:
The conclusion of the argument is summed up in the statement, "Whether or not one can rightfully call a person's faithfulness a virtue depends in part on the object of that persona's faithfulness". This statement conveys the idea that the object of faithfulness is one factor that should be considered when determining whether that faithfulness deserves to be called a virtue. This matches with option A, which says "The object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous".

Option B is only a partial statement of the argument; it is true that virtuous behavior is praiseworthy, but this is not the main point of the argument. Option C is a partial reversal of the author's statement that resentment is not virtuous. Option D is also a partial statement of the argument; the author does recognize that faithfulness and resentment are related, but this is not the main point of the argument as a whole. Option E is also a partial statement; it only focuses on resentment, rather than the idea that faithfulness can be virtuous or not depending on its object. 

Therefore, A is the best answer choice.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The argument in the text discusses how the object of a person's faithfulness affects whether it is considered a virtue. The author argues that virtues are praiseworthy, so faithfulness to something virtuous is laudable, while faithfulness to something harmful- like resentment- is not. So, the conclusion is that the object of a person's faithfulness affects whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. Option A most accurately summarizes this conclusion. The other options are either too broad, too specific, or miss the point of the argument.

Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: The information in the passage most helps to answer a which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: What laboratory experiments were conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs?
  B: What was the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1 987?

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale. This concept refers to the phenomenon where the bigger a business is, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more productive the business can become. This is illustrated by the example of a pin factory in the passage.
  A: This example does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. Instead, it describes a reduction in productivity due to relaxed standards.
  B: This example does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. Instead, it describes a more efficient division of labor within a bee colony.
  C: This example does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. Instead, it describes an increase in capacity due to a scheduling change.
  D: This example does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. Instead, it describes an increase in productivity due to technology.
  E: This example does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. Instead, it describes the division of labor and growth of an ant colony.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The second paragraph of the passage describes that "increasing returns to scale" mean that the bigger a business is, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more productive it can be per worker.
  A: This choice describes a decrease in productivity (relaxing the standards) and a decrease in the number of employees (employing fewer editors), which is opposite to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This choice describes a way to improve the efficiency of a bee colony, but it does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale in a business.
  C: This choice describes a way to increase the number of students in a school building, but it does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale in a business.
  D: This choice describes an improvement in technology which leads to an increase in productivity per trap, which is similar to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  E: This choice describes an increase in the number of ant colonies, but it does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale in a business.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as the phenomenon where the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output per worker can be produced. This results in a natural tendency towards monopoly, as larger firms can achieve economies of scale and hence lower costs than smaller firms.
  A: The scenario describes a decrease in productivity, as the publishing house is able to employ fewer editors.
  B: The scenario describes a reallocation of resources, but it does not involve increasing returns to scale.
  C: The scenario describes a way to increase capacity, but it does not involve increasing returns to scale.
  D: The scenario describes a technological improvement that leads to greater productivity, but it does not involve increasing returns to scale.
  E: The scenario describes an increase in output resulting from the division of labor in a larger organization, which is an example of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as the concept where the bigger the firm, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more productive each worker is. 
  A: This example describes decreasing returns to scale because the company is able to employ many fewer editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. 
  B: This example describes division of labor, not increasing returns to scale. 
  C: This example describes how a school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation. This is an example of increasing returns to scale because the more students the district accommodates, the more productive it is. 
  D: This example describes advances in technology that make the doors to lobster traps easier for lobsters to get through, which would lead to decreasing returns to scale. 
  E: This example describes division of labor, not increasing returns to scale. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as the concept that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more products the factory can produce per worker. This creates a natural tendency toward monopoly, but for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. The idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  
A: This answer choice describes a reduction in productivity, which is the opposite of increasing returns to scale.
B: This answer choice describes a bee colony that is able to collect more nectar because it is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This is related to the idea of specialization and the increased efficiency that comes with it, but it does not involve the concept of increasing returns to scale.
C: This answer choice describes a school district that is able to accommodate more students by switching to year-round operation, but it does not involve the concept of increasing returns to scale.
D: This answer choice describes the lobster industry as a whole being able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps because of advances in technology. This is related to the idea of increased productivity, but it does not involve the concept of increasing returns to scale.
E: This answer choice describes a large ant colony dividing and producing two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. This is related to the idea of increasing returns to scale because the two colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes that increasing returns to scale lead to larger firms being able to achieve lower costs than smaller firms, which can lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly. This is opposed to the concept of the invisible hand, which requires many competitors in each industry to prevent anyone from exerting monopoly power.
  A: This scenario does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale discussed in the passage. It describes a scenario where productivity is increased by relaxing standards, which is not related to the size of the operation.
  B: This scenario does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale discussed in the passage. It describes a scenario where the bee colony is able to divide labor to collect more nectar, but it does not relate to the size of the operation.
  C: This scenario does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale discussed in the passage. It describes a scenario where the school district increases the number of students it can accommodate by switching to year-round operation, but it does not relate to the size of the operation.
  D: This scenario best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale discussed in the passage. The lobster industry is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. This allows the industry to produce more per worker as the size of the operation grows.
  E: This scenario does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale discussed in the passage. It describes a scenario where two ant colonies grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies, but it does not relate to the size of the operation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage describes increasing returns to scale as the phenomenon where the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. Increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. For the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D") 
Choice D best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale. The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. This is an example of how the efficiency of the industry has increased with the same number of traps, as a result of technological improvements.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that the bigger a firm gets, the more efficient it becomes, leading to lower cost per unit of output. This concept is illustrated by the example of the pin factory, where more specialization leads to higher productivity per worker. However, this can lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly, which can be opposed to the idea of many competitors in each industry, necessary for the invisible hand to work properly.
A: This choice describes a decrease in productivity, not an increase, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
B: This choice describes an increase in efficiency, but it is not related to the size of the bee colony or its workers, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
C: This choice describes an increase in the total number of students accommodated, but it is not related to the size of the school district or its workforce, so it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
D: This choice describes an increase in productivity due to advances in technology, which could be related to the concept of increasing returns to scale. However, the passage describes increasing returns to scale as the result of specialization, not technology, so this choice is not the best illustration of the concept.
E: This choice describes an increase in the total number of ants in the colony due to the division of labor, which is similar to the example of the pin factory. As such, this is the best illustration of the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as the concept that "the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker." This is in opposition to the idea of diminishing returns, where "each additional unit of labor or capital produces less output than the previous unit did."
  A: The example given has to do with relaxing standards, which is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: The example given has to do with specialization (guarding nectar sources), but it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: The example given has to do with increasing the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building, but it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D: The example given has to do with advances in technology that make it easier to catch lobsters, which increases the amount of lobsters the industry can catch. This is an example of increasing returns to scale because the same number of traps can catch more lobsters, leading to greater output without a proportional increase in inputs.
  E: The example given has to do with the division of a large ant colony into smaller colonies, which together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. This is an example of increasing returns to scale because the division of the colony allows for greater specialization and efficiency, leading to greater output without a proportional increase in inputs.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes that increasing returns to scale leads to larger businesses having a competitive advantage over smaller businesses because of the specialization of labor and lower costs. This can lead to monopolies, which are not ideal for the invisible hand to work properly. The passage also states that the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. 
A: This example does not illustrate increasing returns to scale, as it describes a decrease in productivity, not an increase.
B: This example does not illustrate increasing returns to scale, as it describes the division of labor in a bee colony, not in a business.
C: This example does not illustrate increasing returns to scale, as it describes a way to increase capacity, but not productivity.
D: This example illustrates increasing returns to scale, as it describes how advances in technology can lead to catching more lobsters with the same number of traps, resulting in higher productivity.
E: This example does not illustrate increasing returns to scale, as it describes a way to increase the number of colonies, but not the productivity of each colony.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how it is structured like a jazz performance. 
  A: This statement is in agreement with the author's assertion that Morrison has simulated the style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: This statement is not related to the author's assertion about Jazz being the first novel to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  C: This statement is too broad and does not specifically address the author's assertion about Jazz.
  D: This statement is too general and does not specifically address the author's assertion about Jazz being structured like a jazz performance.
  E: This statement is not related to the author's assertion about Jazz being the first novel to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel "Jazz" and its connection to jazz music.
  The passage compares the structure of the novel to the structure of a jazz composition, in which individual musicians improvise solos within the fixed framework of the composition.
  The passage suggests that Morrison achieves a similar effect by allowing her characters to speak in first-person sections set off by quotation marks within the overarching narrative structure.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, particularly jazz music.
  The author argues that the novel's structure is analogous to the structure of jazz music, with a collective narration that allows for individual character voices and improvisation within a fixed scope.
  The author contrasts this with the traditional structure of novels, which typically have a single, consistent narrative voice.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if which one of the following were true? 
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music. 
  This statement is irrelevant to the author's assertion about Toni Morrison's Jazz, which is about using jazz music as a structuring principle for a novel. The author does not discuss other novelists who may have used music as a basis for their work. Therefore, this choice would not call into question the author's assertion.
Response 3:

Action: Answer("B")  
The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music. This is because the passage specifically states that "none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz". Therefore, if it were true that a small number of African American novelists had based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, the author's claim that none had done so before Morrison would be called into question.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts
  B: to present evidence that undermines a theory

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.

  B: According to the passage, researchers' funding is often contingent on whether they can produce a patentable product.
  C: According to the passage, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. However, the passage also states that scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable.
  D: The passage does not mention that university researchers believe their intellectual labor is being unfairly exploited by universities that partner with for-profit corporations.
  E: The passage does not mention that most researchers prefer a competitive model of scientific research to a communal model.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer. 
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. 
  Molina and Rowland's advocacy of dramatic policy changes led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. 
  CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The passage provides information that the depletion of the ozone layer can lead to excessive absorption of ultraviolet light, which contributes to skin cancer. It also explains that regulating the use of CFCs, which contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, led to the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals. Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the information in the passage is that "Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer."
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery that CFCs deplete the ozone layer, which contributes to skin cancer. 
  A: The passage does not support this statement. There is no indication that there is little or no ozone destruction without chlorine in the stratosphere. 
  B: The passage mentions that ultraviolet light contributes to skin cancer but does not suggest that it is the primary cause. 
  C: The passage discusses CFCs as a chemical that results in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere, but it does not suggest that other chemicals cannot do so. 
  D: The passage supports this statement, as it notes that the depletion of the ozone layer contributes to skin cancer, and regulating the use of CFCs helps to prevent this. 
  E: The passage does not support this statement. There is no indication that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Ultraviolet radiation contributes to skin cancer.
  - Ozone is a protective layer against ultraviolet radiation.
  - Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  - Molina and Rowland's research showed how CFCs result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere, which is devastating to the ozone layer.
  - The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  - Molina and Rowland's advocacy led to the development of an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The passage discusses the relationship between the depletion of the ozone layer and skin cancer caused by ultraviolet radiation. While the passage explains how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, leading to an increase in ultraviolet radiation and a higher incidence of skin cancer, it does not suggest that regulating the use of CFCs directly lowers the incidence of skin cancer. Rather, it suggests that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer by reducing the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches the Earth's surface due to the depletion of the ozone layer. Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that "Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer."

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" (lines 18-19) for which one of the following reasons?
Choices:
  A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics
  B: to illustrate the influence of religion on the historical development of art
  C: to present an example of the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist
  D: to show how an artist can subvert the ideals of the patron
  E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics. The passage explains that historically, there were two different ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites," and that the second way is preferred by sociohistorical critics because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of how such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. The example of Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments commissioned by Pope Julius II is used to illustrate this point. Therefore, the correct answer is A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics. Specifically, the author is discussing the second way that art was "produced by and for political and social elites," which was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life. In this case, Raphael's frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II to decorate the Vatican apartments, and they were intended to reflect the ideals and power of the papacy. The author uses this example to explain how sociohistorical critics analyze art that was produced for and by the elite, looking for ways in which the art embodies the ideology of the patrons. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics. Specifically, the example is used to illustrate the second way in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites," which is to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life. The author goes on to explain that this type of art enables sociohistorical critics to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics. Specifically, the author explains that some works of art were created to express and mirror the ideals and way of life of the elite, and that sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with this type of art because it allows them to analyze the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, regardless of the identity of the artist.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics. The passage explains that sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze art produced by political and social elites that expressed and mirrored their ideals and way of life. The frescoes in the Vatican apartments were commissioned by Pope Julius II, who was a member of the political and social elite, and they reflect the ideals and way of life of the Catholic Church, which was the dominant institution of the time. Therefore, the frescoes provide an example of the kind of art that sociohistorical critics are interested in studying.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The author explains that the second way art was produced for political and social elites was to create a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments commissioned by Pope Julius II. However, the author goes on to explain that the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures, and that sometimes the more talented artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Therefore, the author is showing that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. Answer("A") is incorrect because Raphael's frescoes are not used as an example of elitism in art, but rather to show that there are exceptions to the pattern of artist/patron relationships. Answer("B") is incorrect because the author does not mention religion as a factor in the historical development of art in this passage. Answer("C") is incorrect because the author explains that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites" and that Raphael's frescoes do not represent the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist. Answer("D") is incorrect because the author does not mention that Raphael subverted the ideals of Pope Julius II.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The author contrasts the two different ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites," and mentions Raphael's frescoes as an example of the first way, where a member of the elite engages an artist to produce something for display that reflects credit on one's taste, rather than a work that expresses and mirrors one's ideals and way of life. Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example of an artist/patron relationship that does not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The author explains that the frescoes were created to express and mirror Pope Julius II's ideals and way of life, rather than being produced simply for display or to impose the patron's ideals. Therefore, the answer is E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

The author cites Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example of an artist/patron relationship that does not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The frescoes were created to express and mirror the ideals and way of life of the patron, Pope Julius II, rather than being commissioned by him to display his taste. Therefore, the answer is E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, and they expressed and mirrored his ideals and way of life. However, the author notes that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings, and some of this art endured. Therefore, the author is suggesting that not all art produced by and for political and social elites can be analyzed in the same way by sociohistorical critics. Answer choice (E) accurately reflects this idea.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?
  C: What kinds of messages and pieces of wisdom are most often communicated by proverbs in the English-language tradition?

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

  The passage discusses two theories about how neurons communicate: one involving electrical impulses and one involving neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitter theory is gradually gaining acceptance due to new evidence about the structure of receptors. The discovery of different varieties of receptors in the neurotransmitter-gated ion channel family raises the possibility of selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the interpretation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans, which are used to identify areas of the brain that are active during cognitive tasks. 
  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. 
  In the case of FMRI, what is actually depicted is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. 
  This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. 
  The modular theory of mind, which underlies the use of FMRI in psychology, may not accurately reflect the nature of mental processes in the brain.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The manner in which FMRI scans are typically interpreted is most analogous to the way in which a store might launch a yearlong advertising campaign and have an increase in shoppers only during the summer, leading one to conclude that the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. In both cases, a baseline measurement is taken and then subtracted from a measurement taken during a specific condition (e.g., a cognitive task in the case of FMRI, or a summer shopping season in the case of the store). The resulting difference is then interpreted as the effect of the specific condition, but this interpretation may be flawed if the baseline measurement is not truly representative of the brain or shopping activity as a whole.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the method of interpreting FMRI scans of brain activity.
  The FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use.
  The FMRI scans are the result of a subtraction: the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to show the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Option B is the most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted. 
  Just as advertisements may have affected all shoppers who visited the store throughout the year, not just the summer shoppers, the entire brain is active in both conditions. 
  The subtraction method used to interpret FMRI scans of brain activity obscures this fact and gives the false impression of neat functional localization.

  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  What is actually depicted in the scan is the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The subtractive method used to interpret FMRI scans obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.

  William Uttal contends that the mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
Action: Answer("B") 
The manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is most analogous to how a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. In both cases, a difference between two conditions is measured (the control condition and the on-task condition for FMRI, and the time period before the advertising campaign and during the campaign for the store), and the difference is assumed to be due to a specific cause (the cognitive task in FMRI and the advertising campaign in the store). However, there may be other factors at play that are not being accounted for.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI depicts the differential rate of oxygen use by subtracting a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The manner in which FMRI scans are interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs, is most analogous to the way a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. Just as the FMRI scan subtracts a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question, the store would subtract the number of shoppers it typically sees during the summer months from the number of shoppers it saw during the yearlong advertising campaign to isolate the effect of the advertising campaign on summer shoppers.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage explains that FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.

Just as the FMRI scan subtracts the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task, the increase in shoppers during the summer is attributed to the advertising campaign by subtracting out any other factors that could have influenced the increase in shoppers, such as the seasonality of shopping habits.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology as a research method, which depends on the premise of the modular theory of mind, but there is a critique of this theory as mental activity may not be decomposable into independent modules.

  FMRI scans are usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs, is most analogous to option B. The FMRI scans are interpreted by taking a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. Similarly, in option B, the store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. This interpretation obscures the fact that advertising may have had some impact on shoppers in other seasons as well.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins
  B: endorse a claim simply because it is widely believed
  C: accept a claim for the sake of argument
  D: attempt to resolve an apparent paradox
  E: assert that their positions are supported by data

  The author of passage A argues that wealth does not lead to greater happiness, and that people's happiness depends on how they compare themselves to others.
  The author of passage B argues that earning more money makes people feel more successful, which leads to greater happiness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses research that reveals a paradox about happiness and wealth. The author explains the paradox by pointing to two phenomena, habituation and rivalry, that push up the norm of income against which people compare themselves. The author also discusses how people compare themselves to their "reference group" and how this is crucial for happiness. The author concludes that the level of happiness has not grown as societies have grown richer. 
  Passage B counters the Solnick and Hemenway study by arguing that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful and have created value. The author argues that wanting to create value benefits society and that it brings happiness. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author of passage A argues that richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society, but over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. The author explains that people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. And people compare themselves with their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness.
  The author of passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version teaches about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture.
  The second version adopts a neutral stance and uses Western scientific methods to study different cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that the Western scientific perspective is not adequate for understanding non-Western cultures.
  They argue that the methods of the cultures studied should be used for understanding them.
  The question asks for the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  Choice D is not related to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. The passage discusses the use of Western scientific methods to study other cultures, not the achievements of Western societies. Therefore, it cannot be the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 
  Choices A, B, and C do not offer a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education because they do not address the issue of the Western scientific perspective being inadequate for understanding non-Western cultures.
  Choice E is already mentioned as a premise in the passage and does not provide an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 
  Therefore, none of the choices provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. The first version advocates for teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture. The second version holds that multicultural education should adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The second version is criticized for using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures, which is seen as distorting and an expression of cultural chauvinism.
A: This statement does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education and does not provide any new information that could contradict the criticism.
B: This statement might suggest that it is possible to find similarities among non-Western value systems, but it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education and does not provide any new information that could contradict the criticism.
C: This statement suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying other cultures, which might be seen as a way to address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. If the second version of multicultural education also allowed for the use of non-Western methods to study other cultures, this could be seen as a way to achieve genuine understanding. However, this statement is not strong enough to provide the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
D: This statement is not relevant to the discussion of multicultural education and does not provide any new information that could contradict the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
E: This statement supports the idea that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, which is consistent with the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. However, it does not address the criticism directly and does not provide any new information that could contradict the criticism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version of multicultural education claims that students should learn about other cultures but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture.
  Critics of the first version argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Critics of the second version argue that the Western scientific heritage is already value-laden and using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures is distorting.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. The first version holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. The second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.

A: This answer choice is not relevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
B: This answer choice is not relevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
C: This answer choice does not provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. It merely suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.

E: This answer choice does not provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. It merely suggests that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, but from within the context of the majority culture.
  The second version of multicultural education differs from the first in that it adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still uses Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures.
  Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon a system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical, and that this method is not appropriate for understanding non-Western cultures.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
None of the choices provides a strong objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education. However, choice E states that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, which is a key point in the passage.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education: one that teaches about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values, and another that adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures but still uses Western scientific methods to study other cultures. 
  Critics argue that the second version is not different from the first because Western scientific methods are already value-laden and cannot adequately understand non-Western cultures. 
  The question asks for the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation: 
  Option E is the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education because it directly challenges the idea that understanding other cultures from a neutral stance is impossible. If genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, then adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures would be an important step towards achieving that understanding. This objection suggests that the second version of multicultural education is different from the first, and that adopting the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology can be a way to achieve genuine understanding of other cultures.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education, the first of which promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture's values.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture.
  The second version holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Critics of the second version argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage introduces two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version of multicultural education advocates teaching about other cultures while approaching them with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture.
  The second version of multicultural education advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures while still using the methods of Western social sciences.
  Critics of the second version argue that adopting the methods of Western social sciences to understand non-Western cultures is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The objection is that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.

The passage provides the most support for inferring that all complete corridos have some lines in common, as described in the passage: "the corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of 'Gregorio Cortez' is translated as follows: 'Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez.' The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme."
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage is about corridos, a type of narrative folk song that has its roots in the Border region between Mexico and the United States.
  Corridos narrate stories that deal with subject matter specific to the Border region, and they are characterized by their use of familiar linguistic and thematic conventions.
  Corridos are composed of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another, and the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida, is a set convention with variable lines.
A: The passage does not provide any support for inferring that "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings. In fact, the passage mentions that corridos were sung at social gatherings to commemorate significant local happenings.
B: The passage mentions that "El Corrido de Kiansis" is the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, which suggests that there are corridos that exist in complete form. However, the passage does not provide enough information to infer that most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
C: The passage states that corridos are composed of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another, and that the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida, is a set convention with variable lines. This supports inferring that all complete corridos have some lines in common. 
D: The passage states that the despedida is a set convention with variable lines, and that the fourth line carries the name of the corrido or expresses its subject, while the second line varies according to exigencies of rhyme. This supports inferring that most corrido variants have different despedidas. 
E: The passage mentions that "El Corrido de Kiansis" records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s, and that corridos consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. This suggests that "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed by someone from the Border region, and does not support inferring that it was composed by someone not from the Border region.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that corridos are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain, and that corridos flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s. Corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. Corridos are sung in Spanish and take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Corridos use highly conventional and readily recognizable imagery to reflect and strengthen the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida, is a set convention, with the first and third lines being the same across different corridos. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

C: The industrialist's decision to continue to illegally discharge a pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant would be a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because he is motivated to avoid the cost of treatment and he believes that the likelihood of getting caught is low.
D: The government official's decision to risk prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family would be a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because she is motivated to maximize her overall satisfaction or expected utility and believes that soliciting bribes is the best way to achieve this goal.
E: The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair would be the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because it is an impulsive crime of passion and his decision-making process is not based on a rational evaluation of the likely outcomes of his actions. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the utility maximization principle, which holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility, and that the expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. The passage also suggests that the decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  
A: The waiter is concealing a large part of his tip income from the government in order to reduce his taxes. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the waiter is attempting to maximize his overall satisfaction or expected utility by reducing his tax burden. 
B: The motorist is avoiding speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the motorist is attempting to maximize her overall satisfaction or expected utility by avoiding the cost of losing her driver's license.
C: The industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the industrialist is attempting to maximize his overall satisfaction or expected utility by avoiding the cost of treating the pollutant.
D: The government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the government official is attempting to maximize her overall satisfaction or expected utility by seeking additional income to support herself and her family.
E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This action is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the worker is not attempting to maximize his overall satisfaction or expected utility. Rather, he is responding impulsively to his emotions and sense of injustice.

  C: An industrialist continuing to illegally discharge pollutants because the cost of treatment exceeds the fine is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as the expected utility from continuing to discharge pollutants, given the chance of getting caught and fined, may exceed the expected utility from treating the pollutants.
  D: A government official risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because of inadequate government salary is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as the expected utility from soliciting bribes, given the chance of getting caught and prosecuted, may exceed the expected utility from not soliciting bribes and struggling financially.
  E: A worker physically assaulting his former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as the expected utility of this action, given the chance of getting caught and punished, is unlikely to exceed the expected utility from not assaulting the supervisor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the utility maximization principle, which holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. According to the utility maximization principle, a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: The utility maximization principle suggests that individuals will behave rationally, choosing the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. In the case of a worker physically assaulting his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair, the assault is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives. It is an impulsive act of aggression and not a calculated response to maximize expected utility. Therefore, the least appropriate description of a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is E.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the historical production and commissioning of art by the elite classes, and the ways in which sociohistorical critics analyze such art. It also mentions the potential limitations of the sociohistorical approach and the possibility of subversion by artists.
A: The answer is partially correct in that it mentions the historical commissioning of art by the governing and well-to-do classes, but it does not accurately represent the main point of the passage.
B: The answer is partially correct in that it critiques a simplistic view of sociohistorical interpretations of art, but it does not accurately represent the main point of the passage.
C: The answer is not supported by the passage and is not accurate.
D: The answer accurately represents the main point of the passage in that it discusses the need for sociohistorical critics to engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify their claims about the embodiment of elite ideals in works of art.
E: The answer accurately represents the main point of the passage in that it discusses the two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

The main point of the passage is that sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic. The author argues that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites," and that the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. The author also suggests that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings, but that sociohistorical critics must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis to claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved. Therefore, the best answer is B.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the historical production of art by and for political and social elites, as well as the different ways that art was produced and the difficulties that sociohistorical analysis faces in interpreting such art. 
  A: This choice accurately reflects some of the information presented in the passage, but it does not capture the main point of the passage, which is more concerned with the difficulties of sociohistorical interpretation than with the identity of the patrons who commissioned art.
  B: This choice accurately reflects the main point of the passage, which is that sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim to reveal the ideals and values of the elite are overly simplistic and must engage in a subtle analysis of how art embodied such ideals.
  C: This choice is not accurate, as the passage does not suggest that patrons were primarily interested in reputation or that they were uninterested in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: This choice accurately reflects the main point of the passage, which is that sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify their claims that works of art embody the ideals of the elite, despite conflicting evidence and the possibility that artists may have subverted these ideals.
  E: This choice accurately reflects some of the information presented in the passage, but it does not capture the main point of the passage, which is more concerned with the difficulties of sociohistorical interpretation than with the different ways that art was produced.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage discusses the ways in which art was produced for the elite classes, and it critiques the idea that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite. The passage argues that sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite, and it discusses the limitations of the aristocracy and the middle class in producing enduring art. Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is that sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic. Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on the historical commissioning of art by the governing and well-to-do middle classes, rather than on the main point of the passage. Choice C is incorrect because it makes a generalization about patrons of the arts that is not supported by the passage. Choice D is incorrect because it is too narrow in its focus on the methods used by sociohistorical critics to justify their claims. Choice E is incorrect because it is too broad and general, and does not capture the main point of the passage.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how art historically was produced by and for political and social elites, and how sociohistorical critics analyze this art. 
  A: This choice is partially correct in that the passage discusses how historically art was commissioned by the governing and well-to-do middle classes, but it misses the main point of the passage, which is about how sociohistorical critics analyze art produced by and for elites.
  B: This choice is partially correct in that it discusses the limitations of sociohistorical interpretations of art, but it misses the main point of the passage, which is about how sociohistorical critics analyze art produced by and for elites.
  C: This choice is not correct. The passage does not discuss how patrons of the arts are interested in their reputation or in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: This choice is partially correct in that it discusses how sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify their claims, but it misses the main point of the passage, which is about how sociohistorical critics analyze art produced by and for elites.
  E: This choice is correct. The passage discusses the two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes historically had art produced for them, and how sociohistorical critics analyze this art.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the historical production of art by and for political and social elites, and the different ways in which this occurred. It also discusses the challenges of analyzing this art from a sociohistorical perspective. 
  A: This choice is partially correct, but it does not accurately express the main point of the passage, which is not limited to the historical commissioning of art by different social classes.
  B: This choice is also partially correct, but it focuses on a critique of one particular interpretation of art, rather than on the broader themes of the passage.
  C: This choice is not supported by the passage, which does not suggest that patrons were primarily interested in enhancing their reputations.
  D: This choice accurately expresses the main point of the passage, which is that sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify their claims about the relationship between art and elite ideals.
  E: This choice is partially correct, but it does not accurately express the main point of the passage, which is not limited to the two ways in which art was produced for the elite. 
Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increased size and specialization, while the Invisible Hand depends on many competitors in each industry to prevent the exertion of monopoly power. Increasing returns to scale, which are associated with the Pin Factory, create a natural tendency toward monopoly, while diminishing returns to scale allow for many competitors to exist in each industry.
A: This answer choice provides evidence that there can be larger businesses in an industry that do not exert monopoly power in all regions, but it does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power described in the passage. 
B: This answer choice describes a potential drawback of worker specialization but is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power or the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
C: This answer choice provides evidence that businesses can collude to set prices even if they are not true monopolies, but it does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power described in the passage. 
D: This answer choice suggests that the size at which businesses begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies by industry, which undermines the idea that increasing returns to scale inevitably lead to monopoly power. 
E: This answer choice provides evidence that increasing specialization can have drawbacks that offset any gains in productivity, which undermines the idea that increasing specialization inevitably leads to increasing returns to scale and monopoly power. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because larger businesses can achieve lower costs than smaller businesses. This means that if returns to scale are increasing, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. For the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. 
A: This statement suggests that there are some larger businesses that are not able to exert monopoly power, while smaller businesses in other regions can. This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
B: This statement is about worker salaries and does not address the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
C: This statement supports the claim that larger businesses tend to drive smaller businesses out of business, leading to fewer competitors and a tendency toward monopoly. Therefore, this statement strengthens the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
D: This statement suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies from industry to industry. This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
E: This statement suggests that there may be other factors that offset the gains in productivity achieved by making workers more specialized. This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

A: This statement suggests that even with larger businesses in the industry, smaller businesses may still have monopoly power in certain regions. This does not undermine the author's argument that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, leading to fewer competitors and increased monopoly power. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.
B: This statement is about the salaries of workers, and does not impact the author's argument that increasing returns lead to monopolies. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.

D: This statement suggests that the size at which a business begins to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This indicates that not all industries will experience the same natural tendency towards monopoly, as some may require a larger size to achieve increasing returns. This undermines the author's argument that increasing returns always lead to monopolies and the need for many competitors in each industry. Therefore, the best answer is Answer("D").
E: This statement suggests that there may be other factors offsetting the gains in productivity achieved by making workers more specialized, thus undermining the argument about the benefits of increasing returns.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how Katherine Dunham was a pioneer in the field of dance ethnology in the 1930s, and how her approach to research diverged from the prevailing methodology at the time. 
  Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, but she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. 
  
  A: The passage does not suggest that injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised Dunham's research. 
  B: The passage does not suggest that Dunham's skill in performing Caribbean dances improved with experience. 
  C: The passage suggests that Dunham's approach to research, which involved extensive personal investment in fieldwork and participation in the dances she was observing, diverged from the prevailing methodology at the time, which emphasized detachment. The passage does not, however, make a general statement about whether extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor. 
  D: The passage does not make a direct statement about whether researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner. 
  E: The passage suggests that dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists had not been trained in dance and experts in dance had not been trained in the methods of social research. The passage does not suggest that colleagues in anthropology assumed that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.

Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how Katherine Dunham, with her training in anthropology and choreography, was able to successfully bring traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into North American and European choreography. 
  The colleagues mentioned in line 33 advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, but Dunham generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself.
  The passage does not provide evidence for any of the choices.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  They advised her not to become too closely involved because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Dunham eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself.
  Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
Action: Answer("C")  
The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with statement C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor. The passage states that Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography. Her approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. However, through her extensive personal investment in the fieldwork, Dunham was able to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices and learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the problems created by the power of juries to nullify, and it argues that juries are not well-suited for this power.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can serve important functions, such as providing a safety valve and indicating problems with the law.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it. Passage A argues that juries are not well-suited for the power of nullification and that they are not legislators, while Passage B argues that jury nullification can serve important functions, such as indicating problems with the law. The interpretation of the law is a significant power, and it is not clear from the passages whether the authors would agree on whether juries should have this power. Therefore, the best answer is D.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues against the power of jury nullification, stating that it creates problems and juries may not have sufficient evidence or be qualified to make such decisions.
  Passage B argues in favor of jury nullification as a safety valve against overzealous officials, and as a means of indicating to the legislature that a law may be unjust.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by the jury's power to nullify, and argues that the jury is not a suitable body to interpret the law.
  Passage B argues that the jury can act as a safety valve if police and prosecutors become overzealous, and that nullification can indicate to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains the potential problems with jury nullification and argues that the jury is not a proper body to change or interpret the law.
  Passage B acknowledges the potential usefulness of jury nullification in certain circumstances, such as when a law is unjust or when a case is too trivial.
  A: Both passages mention that juries are not required to explain their verdicts. However, only Passage A discusses problems created by this lack of information.
  B: Both passages acknowledge that the proper reach of the criminal laws is a matter for reasonable people to disagree on. However, only Passage A argues that disagreements should take place in public, where they can be scrutinized and debated.
  C: Passage A argues that juries are unelected, unaccountable, and have no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. However, Passage B does not make any claims about the relative bias of elected officials and jurors.
  D: Passage A argues that jurors are not legislators and should not interpret the law. However, Passage B acknowledges that juries can use their discretion to decide whether a case is too trivial or extenuating for a conviction.
  E: Passage B acknowledges that police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue. However, neither passage argues for or against reducing this discretion. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by the jury's power to nullify, and argues that it is not a good idea for juries to have this power.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful function, and that it can help to identify problems with the law.
  A: Both passages seem to agree that juries are not required to explain their verdicts, but do not seem to disagree about whether they should be more forthcoming.
  B: Both passages seem to agree that reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws, and that the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated.
  C: The passages do not make any direct comparisons between elected officials and jurors in terms of bias, and therefore do not disagree on this point.
  D: The passages seem to disagree on this point. Passage A argues that jurors are not legislators, and that their power to nullify is problematic because they are not elected or accountable, and may not have sufficient evidence to make a reasoned decision. Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful function, and that it can help to indicate to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.
  E: Passage A does not discuss the issue of police and prosecutors' discretion, but argues against the jury's power to nullify. Passage B suggests that the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to the use of CFCs.
  Molina and Rowland's research showed how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is devastating as it reduces its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer can continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
Action: Answer("E")  
Based on the passage, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. The passage explains that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, and that the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Therefore, testing whether a potential replacement for CFCs breaks down into its components under ultraviolet radiation could help determine whether it would also damage the ozone layer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. 
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  To determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, it would be most useful to test the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine. As described in the passage, chlorine is one of the constituent elements of CFCs that is particularly damaging to the ozone layer. Testing whether a chemical would react with chlorine would help determine whether it would have similar harmful effects on the ozone layer as CFCs.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the release of chlorine into the stratosphere, which reacts with ozone molecules.
  The passage also mentions an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  According to the passage, the depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the release of chlorine into the stratosphere, which reacts with ozone molecules. Therefore, testing a chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be the most useful experiment for determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to the use of CFCs.

  The Montreal Protocol of 1987 led to the ban of ozone-depleting gases.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  Of all the experiments mentioned, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. This is because the depletion of ozone is caused by the breakdown of CFCs into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when they are subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, testing whether a chemical would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would help determine whether it could be a suitable replacement for CFCs.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the damage caused to the ozone layer by CFCs.
  Molina and Rowland showed that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
Action: Answer("E")  
Based on the passage, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which chemically react with ozone, both destroying the ozone and regenerating the chlorine atoms. 
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. 
Action: Answer("E") 
Based on the passage, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. This is because the depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the release of CFCs into the atmosphere, which break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, if a chemical were to break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, it could potentially pose a similar threat to the ozone layer.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the impact of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer and how CFCs chemically react and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. The passage also mentions that Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response and that an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) was developed to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.

Analysis:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. The passage does not provide information on any specific chemical that could replace CFCs. However, based on the passage, a chemical that could replace CFCs would need to be environmentally friendly and not contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer. The passage also discusses how CFCs chemically react and deplete the ozone layer, so it would be important to test whether a replacement chemical would have a similar reaction.

Action: Answer("E")  
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs and the resulting damage to the ozone layer's ability to shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  Molina and Rowland's research showed that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, and that the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  The passage discusses the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Action: Answer("E") 
Based on the passage, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. This is because the depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the breakdown of CFCs into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, testing a potential replacement chemical's susceptibility to breakdown into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be a key factor in determining its safety with respect to the ozone layer.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, who showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  The passage also mentions that the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. 
  The passage states that an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) was developed to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Action: Answer("E")  
Based on the passage, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. This is because CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere, which is devastating to the ozone layer. Therefore, testing whether a potential replacement for CFCs breaks down into its components under similar conditions would be a crucial factor in determining its suitability as a substitute.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere.
  The depletion of the ozone layer diminishes its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland were pioneers in researching and advocating against the use of CFCs.
  The Montreal Protocol of 1987 was developed to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Action: Answer("E") 
Based on the passage, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Popper's views on the power of negative evidence and how scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. It also explains that when a prediction fails, there is usually more than one possible explanation.
  Passage B discusses how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. When their predictions were incorrect, they changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Later, when predictions for the orbit of Mercury were not borne out, they hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  Passage B discusses how astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Mercury, which they called Vulcan, to explain why predictions for the orbit of Mercury were not borne out. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. This illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A, because the scientists were unable to account for the discrepancy between their predictions and the observed orbit of Mercury, and there was more than one possible explanation for the failure of their prediction.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, which is the power of negative evidence.
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus and Mercury using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  A: Uranus is the planet whose orbit was being predicted, but it does not illustrate a disturbing force.
  B: The sun is one of the auxiliary assumptions used by astronomers to predict the orbit of Uranus, but it does not illustrate a disturbing force.
  C: Neptune is the planet that astronomers discovered close to Uranus, which helped bring their calculations into alignment with their observations. It does not illustrate a disturbing force.
  D: Mercury is the planet whose orbit was being predicted using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. Astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet called Vulcan to explain the observations, which was never found. This illustrates a disturbing force as described in passage A.
  E: The moon is not relevant to the context of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's philosophy of science, specifically his notions of positive and negative evidence and the search for negative evidence.

  Disturbing forces are mentioned in Passage A as one of the auxiliary premises that scientists use to derive predictions from theories. 
  Disturbing forces are not directly mentioned in Passage B, but the passage does discuss auxiliary assumptions, which are similar to auxiliary premises in that they are additional assumptions that scientists use to derive predictions from theories.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science, where he argues that negative evidence is more valuable than positive evidence. He believes that scientific theories should make predictions that are testable, and that searching for evidence that would disprove theories is at the heart of scientific research.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and Neptune, and the attempts to predict their orbits using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. When the predictions failed, scientists hypothesized the existence of another planet, which was later discovered.
  
Analysis:
  This question asks about a specific concept mentioned in passage A (line 26), which is "disturbing forces". This concept refers to additional "auxiliary" premises that scientists need to consider when deriving a theory's predictions, including the correct functioning of instrumentation and the absence of disturbing forces. The question asks for an example of a disturbing force in passage B.

Knowledge:
  A: Uranus is the planet being discussed in passage B, but it is not an example of a disturbing force.
  B: The sun is one of the auxiliary assumptions used in predicting the orbit of Uranus, but it is not an example of a disturbing force.
  C: Neptune is the planet that was discovered in the precise place where scientists hypothesized another planet would be, but it is not an example of a disturbing force.
  D: Mercury is the planet whose orbit was predicted using Newton's laws, but the predictions were not borne out. The discovery of Einstein's general theory of relativity later explained the discrepancies in the predictions, but Mercury is not an example of a disturbing force.
  E: The moon is not mentioned in either passage A or passage B.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes how when an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation, and that positive evidence is never conclusive, but negative evidence rarely is either.
  Passage B describes how when astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus, they made their predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  In Passage B, the astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets when they found that their predictions for the orbit of Uranus were incorrect. They concluded that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Later, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations. This illustrates a disturbing force, as described in Passage A, because the existence of Neptune was an additional "auxiliary" premise that the astronomers needed to take into account when deriving their predictions for the orbit of Uranus.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A explains that scientists usually need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. 
  Passage B explains that one of the auxiliary assumptions that astronomers had when predicting the orbit of Uranus was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.

They changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  In Passage B, Neptune most clearly illustrates a disturbing force. The astronomers' original assumption was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus, but when they made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. They changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. They later found Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science, particularly his ideas about the power of negative evidence and the search for evidence that would disprove theories.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the attempts by astronomers to predict its orbit, which involved auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. When the predicted orbit was found to be incorrect, astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets in the vicinity of Uranus.
  A disturbing force, as described in passage A, is one of the diverse additional "auxiliary" premises that scientists often need to use to derive a theory's predictions. Disturbing forces refer to any factors that may affect the accuracy of the predictions, such as the presence of other planets or gravitational forces.
Action: Answer("C")  
The astronomers in Passage B changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets in the vicinity of Uranus when they found that the predicted orbit was incorrect. Later, they hypothesized the existence of another planet, Vulcan, in the vicinity of Mercury to explain the discrepancies between the predicted and observed orbits. These assumptions about the existence of other planets are examples of auxiliary premises that could be affected by disturbing forces. Of the answer choices, Neptune is the only one mentioned in Passage B as an auxiliary assumption that was changed by the astronomers due to the discrepancies in their calculations, making it the most likely answer.

Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes how auxiliary premises are used in scientific research to derive a theory's predictions, and how disturbing forces can affect the accuracy of a prediction. 
  Passage B describes how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. They changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets to explain the failure of their prediction, and later discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations. They also hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Mercury, which they called Vulcan, but it was never found. 
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  In passage B, Mercury most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A. The astronomers' predictions of Mercury's orbit were not borne out, leading them to hypothesize the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan.

This failure of prediction could have been due to the presence of a disturbing force affecting Mercury's orbit, or to an error in one of the auxiliary assumptions used in the prediction.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science, particularly his ideas about the power of negative evidence and the search for evidence that would disprove theories.
  Passage B discusses the attempts of astronomers to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury, and the hypotheses they developed to explain the failure of their predictions.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?
Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission.
  The products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Meitner was the one who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: According to the passage, the physicists had a specific expectation regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, and this expectation was a significant factor that caused them to overlook that they were actually splitting atoms. Therefore, if the physicists had not had particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, then they would have been more likely to realize that atoms were being split. Choice B suggests that the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, so it would have been the most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. The other answer choices are not supported by the passage.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939.
  Researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and submitted her conclusion for publication.
  The relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  
A: The passage does not suggest that the physicists using the same research techniques would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
B: If the physicists had not had particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they might have been more open to the possibility of nuclear fission. However, the passage does not suggest that this would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
C: Earlier, before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. However, the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. Therefore, this option is not correct.
D: More physicists concentrating on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium might have led to more discoveries and a quicker realization of nuclear fission. Therefore, this option is correct.
E: The passage does not suggest that conducting experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how scientists discovered nuclear fission, which is the splitting of the nuclei of atoms.
  The discovery was made between 1934 and 1939, and involved several physicists in Italy and Germany.
  The scientists had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that led to the recognition of nuclear fission.
  The scientists were not even receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in the context of their experiments.
  Meitner and her research partner Otto Hahn identified barium as one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium, which would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism they envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: According to the passage, the scientists conducting the experiments had an expectation that the by-products of the neutron bombardment of uranium would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. This expectation, along with the difficulties in precise chemical analyses, contributed to the delay in recognizing that the nuclei of atoms were being split. Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, it would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. Choice (B) is the best answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The discovery of nuclear fission took several years and was hindered by researchers' expectations and the difficulties of working with highly radioactive materials.
  A: The use of similar research techniques by the physicists would not have had a significant impact on their ability to realize that atoms were being split.
  B: The physicists did have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, which hindered their recognition of the significance of the results.
  C: Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart before the neutron-bombardment experiments, but researchers were not receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  D: It is not clear how more physicists concentrating on obtaining experimental results would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  E: Conducting experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium would not have led to the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how scientists discovered the process of nuclear fission, which involved splitting atoms.
  The scientists conducting the experiments had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that allowed scientists to realize they were splitting atoms.
  The discovery of nuclear fission took place between 1934 and 1939, and it took some time for scientists to realize what they had discovered.
A: The physicists using the same research techniques is not relevant to the question of how to reduce the amount of time to realize atoms were being split.
B: The physicists did have expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, and this expectation hindered their ability to recognize that atoms were being split.
C: Some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, but the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. Therefore, the physicists were aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
D: This answer choice is too vague to determine whether it would have reduced the amount of time to realize atoms were being split.
E: There is no mention in the passage of physicists conducting experiments in neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium. Therefore, this answer choice is not relevant to the question. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing. Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  
A: The passage does not mention anything about the research techniques of the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium. Hence, it cannot be concluded that this would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
B: The passage mentions that the expectation that the by-products would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition had prevented the researchers from identifying the products produced by the neutron bombardment of uranium as something other than elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Hence, if the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, then it could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. 
C: The passage mentions that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated. Hence, the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms. Therefore, this choice cannot be the answer.
D: The passage does not mention that the number of physicists involved affected the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. Hence, it cannot be concluded that more physicists concentrating on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
E: The passage only talks about the neutron bombardment of uranium. Hence, it cannot be concluded that conducting experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

  When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The passage states that the products of the experiments remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products (choice B), they would have been more open to recognizing that they were witnessing nuclear fission.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how the discovery of nuclear fission was made, and how it took several years before physicists realized what they had accomplished.
  Physicists had been conducting experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium, but did not initially recognize that they were splitting atoms.
  Lise Meitner was the physicist who recognized the significance of the data, and coined the term "nuclear fission".
  
A: The passage does not provide any information about the research techniques used by the physicists. Therefore, it is unlikely that this would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
B: The passage states that researchers were not receptive to the possibility that atoms were being split, and had particular expectations about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. Therefore, if the physicists had not had particular expectations about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they may have been more likely to recognize that atoms were being split. This could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. 
C: The passage states that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, but the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.

  The passage explains that Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, recognizing that researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  The passage also explains that researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in that context. 

Analysis: 
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. 
  Option A is irrelevant because the research techniques used by the physicists are not discussed in the passage as a factor in recognizing nuclear fission.
  Option B is also irrelevant because the passage explains that researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in that context, so their expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products would not have affected their recognition of nuclear fission. 
  Option C is also irrelevant because the passage explains that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, but the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. Therefore, the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  Option D is also irrelevant because the passage does not suggest that more physicists would have helped in recognizing nuclear fission. 
  Option E is also irrelevant because the passage only discusses the neutron bombardment of uranium. 

Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Three positions are presented and each is elaborated in detail.
  B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.

  D: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be superior to the first two.
  E: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be inferior to the second.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage presents three positions on the relationship between literature and reality. The first two positions are presented in the first sentence, and then the passage goes on to explain Dostoyevsky's position, which is presented as a third alternative. Throughout the passage, Dostoyevsky's position is differentiated from the first two in detail. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage presents three positions on Russian literary criticism, but it focuses on the third position taken by Dostoyevsky. The first two positions are briefly described, but the majority of the passage is dedicated to explaining how Dostoyevsky's position differed from the first two. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the material presented in the passage is that three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. Choice B is the best answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses three different positions on the role of literature in society during Dostoyevsky's time in Russia. 
  The first position is that art should stand above the present and the everyday. 
  The second position is that art should find its sources in concrete reality and contribute to the creation of a new society. 
  The third position, which Dostoyevsky takes, is that reality is literature's crucial source, but reality is not limited to the tangible and there is no distinction between fantasy and reality. The task of the writer is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. 
  Dostoyevsky criticizes the second position for insisting that art must serve a particular political view and the third position for requiring that art must be useful to people and society.
Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and its explanation of altruism from an evolutionary standpoint.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for being a "conspiracy theory" that imputes an interest to the agent of the behavior that is not openly acknowledged or aware of.
Action: Answer("D") 
The statement "Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" (line 12-13) from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it suggests that evolutionary psychology attributes ulterior motives to genes that are not acknowledged by the individual exhibiting the behavior. The statement implies that genes are acting in a way that appears unselfish, but in reality, they are promoting their own self-propagation. This is similar to how a conspiracy theory attributes hidden motives to individuals or groups that are not openly acknowledged.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the application of evolutionary theory to the study of human behavior.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for attributing hidden motives to agents of behavior.
  A: This assertion describes the method of evolutionary psychologists, but it does not exemplify the conspiracy theory critique.
  B: This assertion describes a problem for evolutionary psychology, but it does not exemplify the conspiracy theory critique.
  C: This assertion describes a behavior, but it does not exemplify the conspiracy theory critique.
  D: This assertion exemplifies the conspiracy theory critique by suggesting that seemingly altruistic actions may actually be motivated by genes' interests in promoting their own self-propagation.
  E: This assertion describes a characteristic of early human societies, but it does not exemplify the conspiracy theory critique.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how evolutionary psychology explains human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals and the proliferation of genetic material.
  Passage B claims that evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
Action: Answer("D")  
The assertion that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish (option D) most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory". In passage A, the author explains how genes that promote their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother rushing to help her injured child. Passage B criticizes the idea that interests in the proliferation of genes necessarily explains behavior, suggesting that there are often multiple explanations for a behavior. The idea of genes promoting self-propagation through apparently unselfish behavior can be seen as an example of an explanation that imputes an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and how it explains human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution. It suggests that apparently altruistic behavior may in fact promote the self-propagation of genes.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology, calling it a "conspiracy theory" because it imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) to the agent of behavior that the agent is not aware of.
Action: Answer("D") 
The assertion in Passage A that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish (choice D) most clearly exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory." The idea that genes are promoting their own self-propagation through apparently unselfish actions suggests that there is an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior is not aware of, which is what the author of Passage B criticizes about evolutionary psychology.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses how evolutionary psychology examines human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution.
  The author of Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it attributes an interest (the proliferation of genes) to the agent of the behavior that the agent is not necessarily aware of or does not openly acknowledge.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A describes evolutionary psychology as a way of explaining human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution.
  Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of.
  The author of Passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology for inferring motives that cannot be shown to be decisive.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolution as a way to explain human behavior, particularly altruism.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for explaining behavior in terms of an interest in gene propagation that is not openly acknowledged or even aware by the agent of the behavior.
  A: This statement describes the approach of evolutionary psychology, but it does not exemplify what the author of passage B means by calling it a "conspiracy theory".
  B: This statement describes a problem that evolutionary psychology seeks to address, but it does not exemplify what the author of passage B means by calling it a "conspiracy theory".
  C: This statement describes an example of altruism, but it does not exemplify what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  D: This statement exemplifies what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it suggests that genes are promoting their own self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, which implies that individuals are not fully aware of the motivations behind their behavior.
  E: This statement describes a characteristic of early human societies, but it does not exemplify what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A describes how evolutionary psychology explains human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior.
  Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. 

Action: Answer("D") 
The assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is "Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" because it implies that genes are manipulating human behavior for their own benefit without the individual's awareness or acknowledgment, which is similar to the idea of a conspiracy theory.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology examines human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution.
  The author of passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
  Passage A describes how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes evolutionary psychology's approach to explaining human behavior from the perspective of evolution.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing an interest in gene proliferation to explain behavior without sufficient evidence.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish. The idea that apparently altruistic behaviors are actually mechanisms for promoting the propagation of genes could be seen as a hidden agenda or interest that evolutionary psychology imputes to human behavior without sufficient evidence.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the music of Arnold Schoenberg and its evolution over time. It also compares Schoenberg to Beethoven in terms of their impact on music and their reception by listeners.

Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
The main point of the passage is that Schoenberg's music, though often controversial and difficult for listeners to appreciate, is worthy of admiration for its expressive range and technical innovations. The passage compares Schoenberg to Beethoven in terms of the challenges their music presented to listeners and the time it took for their most challenging works to become popular. However, the passage does not argue that Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven, nor does it suggest that Schoenberg's music is still widely regarded as shrill and incoherent. The passage also discusses the 12-tone technique, but it does not present this as Schoenberg's most important contribution to music. Finally, the passage does not suggest that Schoenberg's music was not accepted as quickly as Beethoven's because of the availability of recordings.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the controversial nature of the music of Arnold Schoenberg, particularly in relation to the ways in which it pushed the boundaries of traditional tonality and extended the expressive range of music. The passage also highlights the technical mastery of Schoenberg's music and the emotional states it conveys.
A: The passage does mention that some listeners have found Schoenberg's music to be shrill and incoherent, but this is not the main point of the passage, which emphasizes the importance of Schoenberg's contributions to the development of music.
B: The passage does compare Schoenberg's accomplishments to those of Beethoven, but it does not argue that Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives
  E: eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases

  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not a reliable criterion to guide policy decisions. The author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. 
A: The author does not express chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities.
B: The author is concerned that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would not lead to excessive government regulation.
C: The author expresses skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
D: The author argues that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives. However, the author also suggests that this principle should be subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
E: The author is not eager to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the difference between lay and expert judgments about risk, focusing on the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk, and argues that judgments about voluntariness are of little utility in guiding policy decisions. The author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the difference between lay and expert judgments about risk.
  The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain
  C: an editorial in a contemporary newspaper from the Lower Rio Grande Border

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage suggests that some researchers are concerned that patenting biological materials may restrict access to them, or result in the patent holder charging high fees for their use.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology, specifically the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI). The method subtracts a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while a subject is performing a cognitive task, with the difference between the two measurements representing the metabolic activity associated solely with the task. The author critiques the modular theory of mind, which posits that mental activity can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions. The author argues that mental processes are likely properties of a more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain, making the idea of neat functional localization problematic.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The author would be most likely to agree with the statement that the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized. The author argues that the modular theory of mind is problematic because it assumes neat functional localization, which is not necessarily supported by the evidence. The subtractive method, by highlighting differences in localized brain activity, may create an illusion of neat functional localization that supports the modular theory of mind.
Response 5:
Knowledge:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce brain scans that depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain. It notes that the method subtracts out all the distributed brain functions and produces striking images of the brain at work. It also suggests that the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules or components instantiated in localized brain regions, may not be valid.
  
Analysis:
  The author of the passage is critical of the modular theory of mind and suggests that the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise from its use in medical diagnosis. The author also notes that the subtractive method used in FMRI obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and on-task conditions, and that it creates an illusion of neat functional localization. Given this analysis, the author would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?

Action: Answer("D")
Choice D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized. 
  This choice presents a view that the author would be critical of, suggesting that the subtractive method supports the modular theory of mind. The author argues that the method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and creates an illusion of neat functional localization. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  
The other choices are not discussed in the passage and are therefore incorrect:
Choice A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
Choice B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
Choice C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
Choice E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology research and the modular theory of mind, which posits that mental processes are separate and distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions. However, the author critiques this theory and argues that mental activity may be a more general activity distributed throughout the brain.

  The passage also critiques the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. The author argues that this premise may be invalid because mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. The author also argues that the subtractive method used in FMRI obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
The author would most likely agree with statement D: "The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized." The author argues that the modular theory of mind may be invalid because mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. The author also argues that the subtractive method used in FMRI gives a false impression of neat functional localization, which is a key tenet of the modular theory of mind. Therefore, the author would likely agree that the subtractive method supports the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion of localized brain functions.

B: The passage does not support the claim that the modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero. Therefore, B is not the correct answer.
C: The passage explains that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. This is supported by the passage and is the correct answer.
D: The passage explains that the subtractive method used in FMRI involves taking baseline measurements of oxygen use in the control condition, which are then subtracted from the on-task measurements. The passage does not suggest that the baseline measurements show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. Therefore, D is not the correct answer.
E: The passage does not specifically mention anger or any other specific emotion. Therefore, E is not the correct answer.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage discusses research into the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which has led to the discovery of a new class of protein pathogens known as prions. The main point of the passage is that prions are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material and are responsible for causing CJD. Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not focus on the production of protein molecules in general. Choice C is incorrect because the passage only suggests that prions may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions, but this possibility has yet to be fully explored. Choice D is incorrect because the passage mentions that the discovery of prions was initially met with skepticism, but subsequent research has supported the conclusion that they are a new class of infectious pathogens. Choice E is a restatement of the main point of the passage.
Response 1:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use

It suggests that the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, may not be valid.
A: The passage suggests that the idea of independent modules of mental activity is not necessarily valid, and does not support the claim that different areas of the brain are responsible for independent modules of mental activity.
B: The passage does not suggest that mental processes are essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason. Rather, it suggests that separating emotion from reason is not a clear-cut distinction.
C: The passage does not suggest that mental processes are generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use.
D: The passage describes the subtractive method used to produce brain scans, but does not suggest that this method is used to detect mental processes.
E: The passage suggests that mental processes are features of a general mental activity that is spread throughout the brain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and the use of brain scans to study mental activity.
  Psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  A: This choice is incorrect. The passage argues against the idea that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules.
  B: This choice is partially correct but does not accurately reflect Uttal's argument. The passage argues against cleanly separating emotion from reason-giving and suggests that the mental processes are more complex than an amalgamation of the two.
  C: This choice is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that mental processes are generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use.
  D: This choice is incorrect. The passage discusses the subtractive method of brain scans but does not suggest that it is the only way to detect mental processes.
  E: This choice is correct. Psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology and the modular theory of mind. The modular theory of mind is a premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. Psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  
A: The passage states that the modular theory of mind is a premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. Psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. Therefore, A is incorrect.
B: The passage mentions that the separation of emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience, but it does not support that the various mental processes are essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason. Therefore, B is incorrect.
C: The passage does not mention that the various mental processes are generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use. Therefore, C is incorrect.
D: The passage mentions that the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but it does not support that the various mental processes are detectable using brain scans enhanced by means of the subtractive method. Therefore, D is incorrect.
E: The passage states that psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. Therefore, E is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage discusses William Uttal's critique of the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions. Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
A: This choice is the opposite of what Uttal contends. He does not believe that mental processes are independent modules based in different areas of the brain.
B: This choice describes Uttal's view in part, but it does not fully capture his argument. Uttal argues that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules; he does not claim that they are an amalgamation of emotion and reason.
C: This choice is not supported by the passage. The passage does not discuss the uniformity of rates of oxygen use associated with mental processes.
D: This choice describes the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but it does not relate to Uttal's argument about the nature of mental processes.
E: This choice accurately reflects Uttal's view, which is that mental processes are features of a general mental activity that is spread throughout the brain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the modular theory of mind, which holds that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. Psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  
A: Independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain is the premise of the modular theory of mind, which is challenged by Uttal. The passage states that "It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules."
  
B: The passage does not state that the various mental processes are essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason.
  
C: The passage does not discuss whether mental processes are generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use.
  
D: The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce brain scans, but it does not say that this method detects mental processes.
  
E: Correct. According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. The passage states that "But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that 'light up,' in response to various cognitive tasks?" and "This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?" which suggests that the modular theory of mind is still attractive because of the way it is illustrated by brain scans produced using the subtractive method.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that people's behavior is caused by the operations of their brain, and that free and rational moral choices may be delusions.

  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
  Passage B argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, regardless of whether they are determined by causality.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that a person's behavior is caused by the operations of their brain and that this changes the way we think about the law, suggesting that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution. 
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism, and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions. It suggests that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, and that actions originating from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument of passage A is that neuroscience changes the way we think about the law, suggesting that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution.
  The argument of passage B is that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism, and actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.
  A: Mental disorder is mentioned in passage B as an example of a situation in which actions may be constrained, but it is not a key concept in the argument of passage B. 
  B: Free choice is a key concept in the argument of passage B, but it is also mentioned in the context of self-delusion in passage A. 
  C: Causality is a key concept in both passages. 
  D: Self-delusion is mentioned in the context of free and rational moral choice in passage A, but it is not a key concept in the argument of passage B. 
  E: Moral responsibility is mentioned in the context of retribution in passage A, but it is not a key concept in the argument of passage B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that the operations of the brain are the only cause of behavior and suggests that retribution should be abandoned in favor of deterrence.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.
  A: Mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B as an example of a constraint on action, but it is not a concept that plays a role in the argument of Passage A.

  C: Causality is a concept that is discussed in both passages, but it is more central to the argument of Passage B.
  D: Self-delusion is a concept that is discussed in Passage A as a possibility when people believe they are making a free and rational moral choice, but it is not a concept that plays a role in the argument of Passage B.
  E: Moral responsibility is a concept that is discussed in Passage A as a justification for retribution, but it is not a concept that plays a role in the argument of Passage B.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that humans are not entirely rational and that their behavior is influenced by their brain, including emotional centers, which may lead to self-delusion.
  The author of Passage A argues that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution in favor of deterrence.
  Passage B argues that free will and determinism can coexist, and distinguishes between free and constrained actions.
  Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Ayer does not discuss the brain's role in his theory.

Action: Answer("A") 
Choice A, mental disorder, is mentioned in Passage B but not in Passage A. Passage B mentions mental disorders such as kleptomania as an example of a constrained action, which is caused by external sources, while free actions are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder).
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that one's behavior is solely determined by the operations of one's brain and that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it can coexist with determinism. Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.

Action: Answer("B") 
The concept of free choice is discussed in passage B, but not in passage A. Passage A focuses on how behavior is determined by the brain and how the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that the operations of the brain cause behavior and that some people may be deluding themselves into thinking they are making free and rational moral choices. Therefore, the criminal justice system should focus on deterrence rather than retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and argues that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely as long as their actions are not constrained.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:

  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will, and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  A: Mental disorder is mentioned in passage B as an example of a condition that can constrain actions, but it is not a central concept in the argument of either passage.
  B: Free choice is central to the argument of passage B, which distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
  C: Causality is important to both passages, as they both deal with the relationship between the brain and behavior, and the question of whether behavior is causally determined.
  D: Self-delusion is mentioned in passage A as a possibility, but it is not a central concept in the argument of either passage.
  E: Moral responsibility is mentioned in passage A as a concept that should be abandoned, but it is not a central concept in the argument of passage B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that a person's behavior is caused by the operations of their brain, and that people may not be making free and rational moral choices even though they believe they are. This suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of punishing bad people for their immoral acts.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will, and argues that actions can still be considered free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which was achieved through experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted between 1934 and 1939.
  In 1938, Meitner discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, and her research partner Otto Hahn informed her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, which would have been impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and how the evidence for it was present for some time but was not fully recognized until Lise Meitner connected the theoretical dots.
  A: This choice refers to the experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which provided evidence for nuclear fission but were not fully understood until Meitner's contribution. It is a correct statement but not the most nearly equivalent to the author's use of "relevant evidence".
  B: This choice refers to Meitner's research related to the discovery of nuclear fission, but it is not the most nearly equivalent to the author's use of "relevant evidence".
  C: This choice refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. This evidence was crucial in identifying the products of nuclear fission, and it was the key piece of evidence that Meitner used to recognize the significance of the data. Therefore, this choice is the most nearly equivalent to the author's use of "relevant evidence".
  D: This choice refers to the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus. This fact was noted by Hahn and was a clue that nuclear fission had occurred, but it was not the key piece of evidence used by Meitner to recognize the significance of the data.
  E: This choice refers to the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long, but it is not the most nearly equivalent to the author's use of "relevant evidence".
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The relevant evidence had been present for some time, but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The evidence was related to splitting uranium atoms.
A: The results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 are part of the evidence, but not the only relevant evidence.
B: The results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938 are part of the evidence, but not the only relevant evidence.
C: The clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium is part of the evidence, but not the only relevant evidence.
D: The fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus is part of the evidence, but not the only relevant evidence.
E: The fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long is not the relevant evidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The author discusses how, between 1934 and 1939, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but without recognizing what they were witnessing. Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939. Otto Hahn wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occurred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus. Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage talks about the discovery of nuclear fission and how it was achieved after a sequence of experiments that provided evidence of its occurrence. The relevant evidence was present for some time, but the right conceptual link was lacking. 
A: The results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 contributed to the evidence, but it is not equivalent to the "relevant evidence" the author refers to.
B: The results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938 contributed to the evidence, but it is not equivalent to the "relevant evidence" the author refers to.
C: The clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium is part of the evidence, but it is not equivalent to the "relevant evidence" the author refers to.
D: The fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus is part of the evidence, but it is not equivalent to the "relevant evidence" the author refers to.
E: The fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long is not equivalent to the "relevant evidence" the author refers to. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The author discusses how scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing. It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations. 
A: This choice refers to the experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939. These experiments provided a lot of evidence, but it was not until Meitner's theoretical connection that the significance of the data was understood. This choice is too broad.
B: This choice refers to Meitner's experiments in 1938. These experiments produced a puzzling group of radioactive substances, but it was not until Hahn's result that the significance of the data was understood. This choice is too narrow.
C: This choice refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. This was the surprising result that Hahn wrote to Meitner about. It was Meitner who recognized the significance of this data. This choice is a possible answer.
D: This choice refers to the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus. This fact was noted by Hahn and provided evidence that uranium atoms were being split. This choice is a possible answer.
E: This choice refers to the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long. This is a fact mentioned in the passage, but it is not the evidence that was relevant to the discovery of nuclear fission. This choice is too broad.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses how scientists had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939 through neutron-bombardment experiments on uranium.
  The researchers had produced a puzzling group of radioactive substances, but they remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  In 1938, Lise Meitner discovered that one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
  Meitner was the one who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
Action: Answer("A")

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum

  The last paragraph of the passage talks about how wampum belts were used to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans caused by a disease agent called prion, which is a new type of protein pathogen that lacks nucleic acid. Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: The passage discusses the contradiction between the idea of increasing returns to scale (as represented by the Pin Factory) and the idea of the Invisible Hand. It notes that, for the Invisible Hand to work, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. The passage goes on to explain that, until recently, economists had failed to account for the increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries. This is the main point of the passage. Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, which are two concepts in economic theory that are opposed to each other. The Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale, where larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, whereas the Invisible Hand represents the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. The passage explains that for almost two centuries, economists have assumed that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing, because it was easier to represent diminishing returns using numbers and equations. Only since the late 1970s has the concept of increasing returns to scale become more mainstream in economic thought. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction inherent in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Although the Pin Factory illustrates the benefits of increasing returns to scale, these returns can lead to monopoly, which is opposed to the idea of the Invisible Hand, which requires many competitors in each industry. The assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, but this assumption does not reflect the reality of many industries. Economists have failed to account for increasing returns because they have been unable to represent them mathematically. Recently, however, economists have found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable. Therefore, choice E, which states that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries, most accurately expresses the main point of the passage.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand concepts in economic theory, and how the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. It explains that the Pin Factory concept reflects the increasing returns to scale that characterize many enterprises, and that until recently, economists failed to account for these increasing returns. Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Thus, the correct answer is E.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction between the two concepts of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory. The Pin Factory concept emphasizes the increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand concept assumes diminishing returns. The passage explains that mainstream economic thought has historically emphasized the latter because it could be described with mathematical rigor, while the former was difficult to model mathematically. However, recent developments in mathematics have enabled economists to account for increasing returns to scale, which are common in many industries. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that until recently, economists have failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Choice (E) accurately expresses this main point.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory, and how the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, making it difficult for economists to incorporate the concept of increasing returns. The passage explains how recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously, and how economists have failed to account for increasing returns until recently. Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Choice E accurately reflects this main point.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The main point of the passage is that until recently, economists have failed to account for the increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries, due to the fact that the Pin Factory concept is notoriously hard to represent mathematically. The passage discusses how this contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand has existed since the publication of Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations in 1776, and how the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries. The passage explains how it wasn't about ideology, but rather about the difficulty of representing increasing returns mathematically. Therefore, the most accurate choice is E.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the tension between the concept of the "Pin Factory" (increasing returns to scale) and the "Invisible Hand" (diminishing returns to scale) in economic theory. The author argues that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries and that it was only recently that economists found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable. Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is that economists, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Choice E is the best answer.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes the historical development of economic theory with respect to the relationship between increasing returns to scale and the invisible hand of the market. The main point of the passage is that, until recently, economists have largely failed to account for the role of increasing returns in economic thought, due in part to the difficulty of modeling them mathematically. The passage also explains how the invisible hand of the market depends on the assumption of diminishing returns, rather than increasing returns, in order to work properly. Therefore, the best answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: The passage discusses the contradiction between two economic concepts, the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and the historical dominance of the concept of diminishing returns over increasing returns. The passage explains how the dominance of diminishing returns was due to the difficulty of representing increasing returns mathematically. The underground river of increasing returns has surfaced recently in economic thought. Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. So, the correct choice is E.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")  
Knowledge: The passage discusses the reasons for the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the North between 1915 and 1960. The passage argues that the Great Migration was triggered by several factors, including increased labor demand in the North due to World War I, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and the North-South income gap. The passage also argues that earlier migrants facilitated later migration by reducing the physical costs of moving and providing a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants. The main point of the passage is that in migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants. Thus, Answer("D") is the correct answer.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The relationship between the mechanical components necessary for a car to run and the features that give a car its distinctive look is the most closely analogous to the relationship between plants' primary and secondary substances. Just as a car can run without its distinctive features, plants can grow without secondary substances. However, just as a car's distinctive features give it its unique characteristics, secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Similarly, mechanical components are necessary for a car to run, while primary substances are necessary for plants to grow and function properly.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the different ways that art was historically "produced by and for political and social elites." 
  The sociohistorical critics, like Taruskin, prefer to analyze art produced in a way that expressed and mirrored the elites' ideals and way of life.
  In order for this analysis to work, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. 
  A great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  
Analysis: 
  The question asks which view Taruskin's position commits him to. The passage describes Taruskin's preference for analyzing art produced in a way that expressed and mirrored the elites' ideals and way of life. However, the passage also suggests that the elites' taste has not always been apt to produce art that endures, and that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Therefore, it is unlikely that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite in some way.

The passage also suggests that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings, and that the sociohistorical critic must engage in an analysis to claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

  The passage discusses two different ways in which art was produced by and for political and social elites.
  The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. 
  Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which art was historically produced by and for political and social elites. The author notes that there are two ways that art was produced by elites: (1) by commissioning a famous artist to produce something for display, and (2) by creating a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life. The author argues that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct an analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. The author notes that for this kind of analysis to work, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which art historically was "produced by and for political and social elites." The two ways were (1) for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display, and (2) to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life. The sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. 
  The passage does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite.
  The passage does not suggest that the most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  The passage suggests that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite may actually support that ideology in some way, but not necessarily if it endures.
  The passage does not suggest that typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Taruskin's view on how art historically was "produced by and for political and social elites" and the two different ways it was done.
  The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display, while the second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, as it enables them to analyze the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.

Analysis:
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to a view that the sociohistorical critics like him prefer to analyze the art produced by the elites that embodied their ideology. However, it does not suggest that Taruskin believes that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways. Nor does it suggest that he believes that the most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite. Additionally, the passage does not suggest that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way. It also does not suggest that typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes. Finally, the passage does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research and the difficulty of conducting research into dance due to the lack of experts in both dance and social research. 
  The passage suggests that Katherine Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques into modern North American dance was due in part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography, and her approach to research which involved participating in the dances herself. 
  The passage does not suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it, nor does it suggest that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research in the past.
  Anthropologists advised Dunham not to become too involved in the dances she was observing.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  Her prolonged immersion in the dances allowed her to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices and to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others.
  Her work was crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right. 

Action: Answer("B") 
The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. This is supported by the fact that dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists did not have the necessary training in dance to understand dance techniques.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance. 
  The passage also describes how dance had been neglected as an area of social research prior to Dunham's work in the field of dance ethnology in the 1930s.
  
Action: Answer("B")
The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with choice B, which states that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. The passage notes that most social scientists at the time gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. This suggests that dance was not recognized as a legitimate area of inquiry. The passage also notes that experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research, which supports the idea that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research in the past.
  The prevailing view at the time was that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Katherine Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. This is because the prevailing view at the time was that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment, which implies that knowledge of dance traditions is not necessary for data gathering. However, the passage goes on to explain that Dunham's approach to research diverged from this methodology and that her success in bringing traditional dance techniques into the mainstream of modern North American dance was due to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the neglect of dance as an area of social research prior to Katherine Dunham's work.
  Anthropologists advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with choice B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.

Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research in the 1930s, and the challenges faced by anthropologists in studying dance due to the lack of expertise in both dance techniques and social research methods. The passage also describes Dunham's success in developing a new research-to-performance method that allowed her to incorporate traditional Caribbean dance forms into modern North American ballet.

Analysis: 
  The question asks about the perspective of the "peers" mentioned in the passage, who are described as social scientists with a preference for "scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry." The passage suggests that these peers would have been skeptical of the study of dance as a cultural phenomenon, and that they may have discouraged anthropologists from participating in dances themselves. The correct answer will reflect this skepticism.

Action: Answer("B") 
  This choice is not supported by the passage, which describes the challenges faced by anthropologists who were not well versed in dance traditions. It is unlikely that the "peers" mentioned in the passage would have agreed with this statement.

  Answer("C") This choice is also not supported by the passage, which describes Dunham's success in developing a new research-to-performance method that allowed her to incorporate traditional Caribbean dance forms into modern North American ballet. This suggests that research into dance as a cultural form can be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.

  Answer("D") This choice is not supported by the passage, which does not suggest that experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.

  Answer("E") This choice is not supported by the passage, which describes Dunham's success in studying traditional dances of African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures, and in incorporating these techniques into new forms of ballet. This suggests that dance forms are not too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.

  Answer("A") This choice is not directly addressed by the passage, which does not suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.

The correct answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. This statement is not supported by the passage, and is unlikely to have been agreed upon by the "peers" mentioned in the passage.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the history of dance ethnology and Katherine Dunham's contributions to the study of dance. 
  The peers mentioned in line 22 are social scientists who neglected dance as an area of social research in the past.
  The passage suggests that the prevailing methodology in the past was to conduct research from a position of complete detachment.
Action: Answer("B")

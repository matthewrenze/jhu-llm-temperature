Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research on happiness and wealth, including the phenomenon of rivalry in which people compare their income to a norm and their happiness is affected by their relative position compared to others. 
  Passage B argues that the desire to create value is behind the desire to earn more money and show material wealth, and that this desire is not necessarily egocentric or ignoble. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The authors in both passages discuss the phenomenon of people comparing their income with some norm to determine their level of happiness, and the importance of feeling successful and creating value in contributing to happiness.
  The authors do not describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "altruistic" or "primitive".
  The authors do not use the terms "insular", "cosmopolitan", "happy", "miserable", "misguided", or "lucky", to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  The authors do not explicitly describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "egocentric", but they suggest that people's desire to create value and feel successful by earning more money does benefit society and is not necessarily a negative or selfish motivation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B are discussing the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Passage A suggests that people compare their income with some norm and that rising income and habituation and rivalry push up the norm. 
  Passage A also suggests that people compare themselves with others who are most like them to determine their level of happiness.
  Passage B suggests that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful and that wanting to create value benefits society. 
Action: Answer("D")  
Based on the language used in the passages, the authors seem to have different opinions about a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors. Passage A suggests that this person is misguided in overinvesting in material possessions at the expense of leisure, while Passage B suggests that this person is admirable because he or she wants to create value and benefit society. Therefore, the pair of terms that best fit these descriptions are "misguided" and "admirable," making Answer D the correct choice.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The two passages discuss the relationship between income and happiness.
  Passage A suggests that people's level of happiness depends on how their income compares to that of others in their reference group.
  Passage B suggests that people feel happy when they feel successful and have created value, and that wanting to earn more than others is evidence of a desire to create value.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between income and happiness, and how people compare themselves with others for happiness.
  Neither passage A nor passage B uses the terms "insular," "cosmopolitan," "altruistic," "egocentric," "happy," "miserable," "misguided," "admirable," "lucky," or "primitive" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between money, happiness, and social comparison.

  Neither passage describes a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors using any of the given pairs of terms.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness, and the phenomenon of people comparing their income with that of others. 
  The authors of Passage B argue that people want to make more money than their neighbors because they want to feel successful and create value, rather than simply because they want to show off or feel superior.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passages do not use any of the terms in the answer choices to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Passage A suggests that people are happier when they are relatively better off than their reference group. 
  Passage B suggests that people feel happy when they feel successful and that they use material wealth to show that they are prosperous because they create value.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss the relationship between money and happiness, and how people compare their income with some norm to evaluate their happiness.
  Passage A describes two phenomena that push up the norm: habituation and rivalry. People tend to adjust to material possessions and want to make more money than others to improve their relative position.
  Passage B argues that the desire to create value is the real reason why people want to earn more money than others, and that the success, not the money itself, provides the happiness.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research on happiness and wealth. They examine how people's income and relative prosperity affects their happiness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: The information in the passage most helps to answer a which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: What laboratory experiments were conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs?
  B: What was the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1 987?
  C: In what year did Molina testify before the U.S. Congress?
  D: Does .any chemical that does not contain chlorine contribute to the destruction of ozone molecules?
  E: Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

It does not provide evidence to support the idea that many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
E: The passage discusses secondary substances that are toxic to insects, but it does not provide evidence to support the idea that some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Therefore, it is unlikely that drawing a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy would soften his attitude toward the radical critics' view.
  B: The radical critics' claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.

Therefore, it is unlikely that acknowledging the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works would soften his attitude.
  D: Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." He also defined "artistic" as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, recognizing the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works is likely to soften Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view.
  E: The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it. Therefore, explaining more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is is unlikely to soften his attitude toward the radical critics' view.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.

  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's 1992 novel Jazz and its connection to music, particularly jazz music. The narrator of the novel shifts between third-person omniscience and the first-person lyricism of key characters, with the sections of the characters set off by quotation marks. The effect is analogous to the playing of a jazz ensemble, with individual musicians improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. 
A: The assertion in lines 11-16 is not that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story, but rather that the narrative structure of Jazz is analogous to the playing of a jazz ensemble. This choice is incorrect.
B: The passage does not discuss any African American novelists who sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music. This choice is incorrect.
C: The passage does not make this assertion. The discussion is specifically about Jazz and its connection to jazz music. This choice is incorrect.
D: The passage does not make this assertion. The discussion is specifically about Jazz and its connection to jazz music, and the analogy to jazz is not simply because the novel can be read aloud. This choice is incorrect.
E: The passage does not provide a comparison of the number of African American writers to non-African American writers who have written novels about music. This choice is incorrect.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how it is structured like a jazz composition, with characters' voices and the narrator's voice interweaving in a similar way to musicians improvising within a composer's frame.
  A: This choice correctly describes the author's assertion that Morrison has intentionally simulated a style of jazz performance in the narration of Jazz.
  B: This choice incorrectly discusses African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, which is not relevant to the author's assertion about Jazz.
  C: This choice incorrectly asserts that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists have narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question, which is not mentioned in the passage and is too broad to be considered.
  D: This choice incorrectly suggests that any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature depending on whether it is read aloud, which is not relevant to the author's assertion about Jazz.
  E: This choice incorrectly compares the number of African American writers to non-African American writers who have written novels about music, which is not relevant to the author's assertion about Jazz.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which is structured like a jazz composition and uses shifting narrative perspectives to create a sense of improvisation within a carefully constructed framework. 
  A: This choice accurately describes the main idea of the passage and the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
  B: This choice discusses a different type of music (blues) and does not relate to the central argument of the passage about Jazz.
  C: This choice makes an overly broad claim that is not supported by the passage and is not relevant to the discussion of Jazz.
  D: This choice is too general and does not relate specifically to the argument about Jazz's structure and narrative style.
  E: This choice discusses the prevalence of music-related themes in African American literature, but does not relate specifically to the argument about Jazz's structure and narrative style.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The question asks about the author's assertion in lines 11-16, which discusses the unique structure of Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, in which the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances.
  A: This statement agrees with the author's assertion that Morrison has simulated the style of a genius of music in her narration of Jazz.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the author's assertion about the structure of Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, and it is also incorrect since the author states that no African American writer had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in Jazz.
  C: This statement is too extreme and goes beyond the author's assertion about Morrison's novel Jazz, which is a specific example discussed in the passage.
  D: This statement is also too general and goes beyond the author's assertion about the unique structure of Toni Morrison's novel Jazz.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the author's assertion about the structure of Toni Morrison's novel Jazz.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how it uses the structure of jazz music in its narration. The passage describes how the narration slips between third-person omniscience and first-person lyricism, with the narrator being both generous with the characters' voices and protective of their mastery over the narrative as a whole. This structure is compared to the playing of a jazz hand, where individual musicians improvise within the framework of the composer's composition. The passage argues that Jazz redefines the possibilities of narrative point of view.
Action: Answer("B")  
Reasoning: The author is discussing Toni Morrison's use of the structure of jazz music in the narration of Jazz. The author notes that while many African American writers have used music as a theme or metaphor in their writing, none had previously attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel. Therefore, if option B were true and a small number of African American novelists had sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, it would contradict the author's assertion in lines 11-16 that Toni Morrison was the first to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel. None of the other options are supported by the passage.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which is structured in a way that simulates the style of jazz music.
  A: This choice accurately describes the author's assertion. The passage states that "Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration". The narrator's shifting between third-person and first-person narration, as well as the use of quotation marks around characters' sections, is compared to the structure of a jazz ensemble.
  B: The passage does not mention any African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  C: The passage does not make this assertion and it is too broad of a statement to be supported by the passage.
  D: The passage does not make this assertion and it is too general of a statement to be supported by the passage.
  E: The passage does not compare the number of African American writers to non-African American writers who have written novels about music.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its structure, which is compared to the structure of jazz music. The author argues that Morrison has found a way to create a sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, similar to how a jazz ensemble improvises within the composer's frame. 
  A: This statement supports the author's assertion and is consistent with the passage.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the author's assertion about Jazz and the structure of the novel.
  C: This statement is too broad and does not relate specifically to the structure of Jazz or the comparison to jazz music.
  D: This statement is too general and does not specifically address the author's assertion about Jazz and the structure of the novel.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the author's assertion about Jazz and the structure of the novel.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how Toni Morrison used the structure of jazz music as the structuring principle for her novel Jazz, and how the narration of the story imitates the style of jazz performance. 
  A: This choice accurately reflects the author's assertion that Morrison has simulated the style of jazz performance in the narration of Jazz. 
  B: The passage does not mention any African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music. 
  C: The passage does not make this claim, and it is too broad to be inferred from the passage. 
  D: The passage does not suggest that all novels can be found to be somewhat musical in nature depending on how they are read. 
  E: The passage does not make any comparison between the number of African American and non-African American writers who have written novels about music.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage describes two sides of a debate on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, and an economic principle is introduced to reconcile the two positions. The economic principle of utility maximization is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. The passage concludes that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage describes a debate between two sides on how to deter deliberate crimes and introduces an economic principle to reconcile the two positions. The principle of utility maximization is used to analyze the decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. The economic principle is used to decide between the two sides in the debate. Therefore, the best answer is B.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage describes a debate between two sides regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, and then introduces an economic principle to reconcile the two positions. The economic principle is then used to demonstrate that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that both deterrence strategies are necessary. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that it describes two sides of a debate and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage discusses a debate between two sides regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. The first side argues that societal norms and institutions influence individuals and that changing these would reduce the crime rate. The second side suggests that individual choice is the primary factor behind the decision to commit a crime and that increasing fines and penalties associated with criminal activity is the best deterrence method. However, the passage introduces the economic principle of utility maximization, which posits that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction. This principle reconciles the two positions and provides an economic framework for analyzing an individual's decision to commit a crime. Thus, the correct answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage describes a debate between two sides on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. One side believes that societal norms and institutions influence individuals, while the other side believes that committing a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. The passage then introduces the economic principle of utility maximization and shows how it reconciles the two positions in the debate. The economic principle is applied to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. The passage concludes that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of this passage is that two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The passage describes a debate about the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. Two sides are presented: one side believes that changing societal norms and institutions will reduce crime, while the other side believes that increasing fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. The passage then introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, which is applied to show that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage describes a debate between two different approaches to deter deliberate crimes, and introduces an economic principle that reconciles the two positions. The economic principle of utility maximization is then used to analyze how individuals make rational decisions about committing crimes. The passage concludes that the two positions are complementary, and that the optimal approach would include elements of both deterrence strategies. Therefore, choice B, "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them," most accurately describes the organization of the passage.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage presents two sides of a debate about the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, and an economic principle (utility maximization) is applied to reconcile them. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them." Choice A is incorrect because the principle is used to reconcile, not to resolve, the conflict between the two sides. Choice C is incorrect because a principle is introduced to reconcile, not to discredit, the two beliefs. Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not instantiate a general principle by providing different ways of solving a problem; rather, it applies an economic principle to show that apparently different ways of solving the problem are actually complementary. Choice E is incorrect because the principle is used to reconcile, not to highlight the differences between, the two sides in the debate.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The passage describes a debate between two schools of thought on crime deterrence. One side suggests that societal norms and institutions are responsible for deliberate crimes, while the other side believes that such crimes are a result of individual choice. The passage then introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, which suggests that individual decision-making is a rational economic choice. The economic analysis shows that the two sides of the debate are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. Therefore, the passage describes two sides of a debate and an economic principle is applied to decide between them. Choice B is the best answer.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage introduces two opposing views on how to deter deliberate crimes and then introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, that reconciles the two positions. The principle is then used to analyze the decision to commit crimes as a rational economic choice. The passage uses this principle to show that the two positions are complementary. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts
  B: to present evidence that undermines a theory
  C: to provide examples that support an argument
  D: to contrast several different modes of expression
  E: to enumerate specific instances in which a phenomenon recurred
Response 0:
Knowledge: The third paragraph of the passage discusses various traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history among Native Americans, including oral storytelling, dance, drama, tattoos, pictographic designs, and other artifacts that conveyed autobiographical information. The paragraph highlights the inclusive nature of identity in many Native American cultures and emphasizes the active participation of the tribe in the expression of an individual's narrative. 

Action: Answer("C") 

The function of the third paragraph is to provide examples that support an argument. Specifically, it illustrates the idea that traditional Native American modes of autobiographical expression were markedly different from the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. The paragraph offers a range of examples, from oral storytelling and dance to tattoos and pictographic designs, to show that Native American culture valued a more fragmented and communal approach to autobiographical expression. By doing so, the paragraph supports the larger argument of the passage that scholars studying Native American autobiographies need to broaden their focus beyond written documents and take into account the cultural constructs and diverse modes of expression of Native American peoples.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph describes different traditional modes of communicating personal history in pre-contact Native American cultures.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
The function of the third paragraph is to provide examples that support the argument that scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history when studying Native American autobiographies. The paragraph describes how oral traditions, dance, drama, tattoos, shields, robes, and tepees were used to convey personal history and how, within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events. Therefore, the most accurate choice is C: to provide examples that support an argument.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The third paragraph describes traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history among pre-contact Native American cultures. 
  The paragraph provides examples of how personal history was expressed through oral traditions, such as songs, chants, stories, and drama, as well as through material artifacts such as tattoos, shields, robes, and tepees.
Action: Answer("C")  
The function of the third paragraph is to provide examples that support an argument. The paragraph provides examples that demonstrate that pre-contact Native American cultures had their own traditional modes of expressing personal history that were different from the European concept of an autobiography. These examples illustrate the inclusive nature of identity, the relationship between personal experiences and current events, and the importance of intercultural collaboration in shaping personal narratives.
Response 3:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.
  B: Researchers' funding is often contingent on whether they can produce a patentable product.
  C: Researchers see no incompatibility between unfettered basic research and the granting of biotechnology patents.
  D: Researchers increasingly believe their intellectual labor is being unfairly exploited by universities that partner with for-profit corporations.
  E: Most researchers prefer a competitive model of scientific research to a communal model.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - The passage discusses the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer in the stratosphere.
  - CFCs break down into chlorine which chemically reacts with ozone, leading to ozone depletion.
  - The depletion of the ozone layer is a threat to human health due to the increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer.
  - Molina and Rowland's research led to the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which banned the production of ozone-depleting gases.

Action: Answer("D")  
Statement D is most strongly supported by the passage. Although the passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer and the resulting increase in ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer, the passage does not make a direct statement about a reduction in skin cancer incidence as a result of regulating the use of CFCs. However, the passage does suggest that the regulation of CFCs has had positive environmental effects. The passage describes a "transformation in packaging for consumer spray products" and the development of "more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals" as a result of the ban on CFCs in North America. The passage also mentions the Montreal Protocol of 1987, an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases, which suggests that regulating CFCs can have indirect positive effects on human health and the environment.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the effects of the depletion of the ozone layer by manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and the advocacy of two scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, for policy changes to address this environmental threat.
  A: The passage states that "Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms" and that "each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive." This suggests that the presence of chlorine is a significant factor in ozone destruction, but it does not necessarily imply that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally without chlorine.
  B: The passage notes that "by 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer" and that "much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone." However, the passage does not support the claim that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: The passage does not provide information on whether other chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: The passage suggests that addressing the depletion of the ozone layer by regulating the use of CFCs can help protect the effectiveness of the ozone layer as a shield against ultraviolet radiation, but it does not directly support the claim that such regulation contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The passage does not support the claim that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the damage that CFCs can cause to the ozone layer, which protects against ultraviolet radiation from the sun. CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which can react with and destroy ozone molecules. Molina and Rowland showed that the accumulation of CFCs in the atmosphere would continue to damage the ozone layer for years even if CFC production ceased immediately. The depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat that can lead to an increase in skin cancers due to increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
A: The passage does not state that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present. It states that in the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium.
B: The passage mentions that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer, but it does not state that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
C: The passage does not mention any other chemicals besides CFCs that can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
D: The passage states that the depletion of the ozone layer can lead to an increase in skin cancers due to increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Regulating the use of CFCs, which can damage the ozone layer, can indirectly contribute to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. 
E: The passage does not state that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  - The passage discusses how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  - The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  - Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response to address the depletion of the ozone layer.
  - The Montreal Protocol of 1987 was developed to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.

Action: Answer("D") 
Statement D is most strongly supported by the information in the passage. The passage discusses that ultraviolet light contributes to skin cancer, and that the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs diminishes its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs.
  The depletion of the ozone layer leads to reduced protection against ultraviolet radiation, which contributes to skin cancer.
  CFCs release chlorine in the upper atmosphere, which is destructive to the ozone layer.
  The work of Molina and Rowland led to the Montreal Protocol of 1987, an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs and how this depletion leads to reduced protection against ultraviolet radiation, which contributes to skin cancer. The work of Molina and Rowland led to the Montreal Protocol of 1987, an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. Option A is incorrect because the passage notes that in the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Option B is incorrect because excessive absorption of ultraviolet light contributes to skin cancer, but the passage is primarily concerned with the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs. Option C is incorrect because the passage notes that CFCs release chlorine in the upper atmosphere, but it does not claim that few other chemicals can result in the release of chlorine. Option E is incorrect because the passage makes no mention of the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurring mainly in Antarctica.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  The depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat that was recognized by scientists and resulted in the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. 
  The ban on CFCs led to the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
A: The passage does not state that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present. It states that, in the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium.
B: The passage discusses how ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer, but it does not state that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
C: The passage does not discuss whether few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
D: The passage discusses how the depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat and how CFCs contribute to this depletion. While the passage does not explicitly state that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer, it does state that much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone in the stratosphere, which helps to protect against skin cancer. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that regulating the use of CFCs, which contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, could indirectly contribute to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
E: The passage does not state that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer by manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat and has been linked to skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")  
Statement D is the most strongly supported by the passage. The passage states that "the depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat and has been linked to skin cancer." Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs, which contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, could indirectly lower the incidence of skin cancer. Statement A is incorrect because the passage states that "in the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium." Statement B is incorrect because although excessive absorption of ultraviolet light can contribute to skin cancer, the passage does not suggest that it is the primary cause. Statement C is incorrect because the passage does not provide evidence to support the claim that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere. Statement E is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  - Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  - The ozone layer in the stratosphere screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  - Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  - Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  - Molina and Rowland's research and advocacy led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The passage discusses the relationship between the depletion of the ozone layer, which is responsible for screening out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation, and the increased risk of skin cancer. Although the passage provides information that supports all of the answer choices to some extent, the strongest statement supported by the passage is that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer because CFCs are one of the primary causes of ozone depletion.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. CFCs slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere where, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. The depletion of the ozone layer was recognized as a pressing environmental threat and public policy changes were implemented to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
A: The passage does not state that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present. The passage does describe how CFCs contribute to the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. 
B: The passage mentions that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer, but it does not state that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
C: The passage does not mention any chemicals besides CFCs that can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere. 
D: The passage describes how the depletion of the ozone layer, caused by CFCs, allows more ultraviolet radiation to reach the earth's surface. This increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation can lead to an increased incidence of skin cancer. Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs can contribute indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
E: The passage does not mention that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Ultraviolet radiation from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  - Ozone in the stratosphere screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  - Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  - Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  - Molina and Rowland's research and advocacy led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.

Analysis:
  - Statement A is not supported by the passage. It is mentioned that in the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium.
  - Statement B is partially supported by the passage. It is mentioned that ultraviolet radiation from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  - Statement C is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention any other chemicals besides CFCs that can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  - Statement D is supported by the passage. It is mentioned that the ozone layer screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation, which contributes to skin cancer.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" (lines 18-19) for which one of the following reasons?
Choices:
  A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics
  B: to illustrate the influence of religion on the historical development of art
  C: to present an example of the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist
  D: to show how an artist can subvert the ideals of the patron
  E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics. The author explains that this kind of analysis enables critics to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. The Vatican is a symbol of political and religious power, and the frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, a member of the governing class. Therefore, the frescoes are an example of art that was "produced by and for political and social elites," which is one of the defining characteristics of "high art" according to Taruskin. Answer choice A is the best answer.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives

Action: Answer("D") 
The sentence at lines 28-31 agrees with the earlier position that defense lawyers' obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society. However, it disagrees on the particulars, because it argues that lawyers who are convinced of their clients' guilt should not try to prove their innocence.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers in providing legal representation to their clients. The passage explains that while lawyers have a duty to provide the best defense possible, their obligations extend not only to their clients but also to the court and to society. The passage further explains that in cases where lawyers know their clients are guilty, they should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence, but instead argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
Action: Answer("D") 
The sentence at lines 28-31 discusses the obligation of lawyers to argue for leniency in sentencing for guilty defendants, but also acknowledges the obligation of lawyers to provide the best defense possible for their clients. This position is in agreement with the earlier position that lawyers have a duty to provide the best defense possible, but differs in the particulars of how they should approach cases where they know their clients are guilty. Therefore, the most accurate description of the relationship between the two sentences is that they show agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.

  Lines 28-31 state that defense lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but advocates for the client's rights given the facts of the case.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
The information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 is related to the sentence at lines 7–11 in that they address the defense lawyer's obligation to the court and to society, in addition to the obligation to the defendant. Specifically, the sentence at lines 28-31 argues that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence, and should instead appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. This relates to the sentence at lines 7-11, which discusses the argument that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. The two sentences at lines 28-31 provide a counterpoint to this argument by emphasizing the lawyer's obligation to the court and to society, as well as the defendant. Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 and the sentence at lines 7-11 can be described as a disagreement over the particulars of the lawyer's role. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage presents two different views regarding the obligation of defense lawyers towards their clients.
  The first view claims that lawyers should provide the best defense they are capable of, regardless of their personal beliefs about their client's guilt or innocence.
  The second view claims that lawyers should not present assertions that they know to be false, and that lawyers who are convinced of their client's guilt should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The sentence at lines 28-31 is in general agreement with the position reported by the author in the earlier lines, but it disagrees over the particulars. The earlier position is that lawyers should provide the best defense they are capable of, while the later position is that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their client's innocence if they are convinced of their guilt. So, while both positions agree that lawyers should provide the best defense possible, they disagree over what that defense should entail in certain circumstances.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients and to the court and society. The passage also discusses the ethical considerations of defense lawyers who have clients that they know to be guilty of the charges against them.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The sentence at lines 28-31 states that "When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this." This statement agrees with the earlier position presented in lines 7-11 that "some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of." However, the sentence at lines 28-31 disagrees with the earlier position in that it provides a specific limitation to the obligation of defense lawyers. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences can be described as agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars, making choice D the correct answer.
Response 8:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?
  C: What kinds of messages and pieces of wisdom are most often communicated by proverbs in the English-language tradition?
  D: In what other ethnic groups besides Mexican Americans do proverbs function to maintain ties to the traditions of those groups?

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: The primary purpose of the passage is most likely to
Choices:
  A: propose a new theory about the workings of the brain
  B: introduce evidence that challenges a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain
  C: describe the approach scientists use when studying the workings of the brain
  D: discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain
  E: illustrate the practical utility of scientific research into the workings of the brain
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how scientists' understanding of how neurons transmit electrical impulses has evolved over time, from an initial theory that electrical impulses travel across synapses to a more recent theory that neurotransmitters released by one neuron can bind to receptors on another neuron, rendering it permeable to ions and generating an electrical impulse that is transmitted to the receiving neuron. The passage also discusses recent evidence that supports this newer theory and describes the potential medical applications of this research.
Action: Answer("D")

The primary purpose of the passage is to discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain, specifically the chemical theory of how electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons. The passage describes the gradual acceptance of this theory, the discovery of the structure of receptors, and the medical significance of this discovery. Therefore, the best answer choice is D: discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the historical development of theories about the workings of the brain, including early theories about electrical impulses traveling across synapses and the more recent theory that neurotransmitters play a key role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The passage also describes recent research that provides evidence for this theory and highlights the medical significance of this research for the treatment of brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the evolution of a theory about how neurons communicate with each other using neurotransmitters, a chemical that binds with receptors in the receiving neuron to create an electrical impulse that runs through the cell. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, and recent research has explained how receptors play a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The passage also discusses the medical significance of these discoveries, suggesting that drugs could be designed to selectively impede or enhance the effects of neurotransmitters on specific types of neurons.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the history of theories about how neurons in the brain communicate, and provides an overview of the structure of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. 
  A: The passage does not propose a new theory about the workings of the brain.
  B: The passage introduces evidence that supports an alternative theory about the workings of the brain, but it does not challenge an existing theory. 
  C: While the passage describes the scientific approach to studying the brain, this is not its primary purpose.
  D: The passage discusses new support for the alternative theory of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, and how this new evidence has helped address previous skepticism.
  E: The passage briefly mentions the potential practical applications of the research into neurotransmitter-gated ion channels and their receptors, but this is not the primary purpose of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two theories about how neurons communicate, one involving electrical impulses and the other involving neurotransmitters, and how the latter theory has gradually gained acceptance due to the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. The passage also mentions the significance of this discovery for potential medical treatments.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains two theories about how communication between neurons is possible. The first theory, which was once believed to be the only one, suggests that electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). The second theory, which has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, suggests that neurotransmitters secreted by the excited neuron bind with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron, rendering the neuron permeable to ions and generating an electrical impulse that runs through the cell, thereby transmitting the electrical impulse to the receiving neuron. The passage then explains that researchers have gathered enough evidence to support this second theory.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the history of two theories of how neurons communicate, one involving electrical impulses and the other involving chemical neurotransmitters. The second theory has gradually gained acceptance, and recent evidence has helped to explain the mechanism by which neurotransmitters convert chemical signals into electrical activity. The passage also notes the medical significance of this research, suggesting that the selective targeting of neurotransmitter receptors could lead to the development of drugs for various brain disorders.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the history of two theories regarding how communication between neurons is possible. The first theory, which was widely accepted, posited that electrical impulses leap across synapses. The second theory, which has gradually gained acceptance, posits that neurotransmitters bind to receptor molecules in the receiving neuron and render it permeable to ions. Recent research has shown that the structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The passage also discusses the medical significance of these discoveries.
Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence
  E: countering a revolutionary hypothesis

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains how the interpretation of FMRI scans is based on subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement to reveal the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and it produces a false impression of neat functional localization.
  A: This choice is about the relationship between one particular district and the new mayor; it is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  B: This choice is about the relationship between a store's advertising campaign and its increase in shoppers; it is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  C: This choice is about the difference in water usage between agricultural and residential customers, and how droughts impact the agricultural sector more severely; it is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  D: This choice is about the relationship between Internet traffic and the time of day, and how most Internet traffic during peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings; it is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  E: This choice is about the cheetah's speed and how it can only run short distances; it is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise from its use in medical diagnosis, and that the validity of neuroimaging in psychology depends on the premise of the modular theory of mind. It also discusses how FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, which involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task, and interpreting the difference as representing the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. The passage notes that this subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and produces a false impression of neat functional localization.
  
A: This choice involves identifying a district that is essential for the election of a candidate. It is not directly analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
B: This choice involves an advertising campaign that has an effect only on a specific group of shoppers during a specific time period. It is not directly analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
C: This choice involves the impact of droughts on different types of water customers. It is not directly analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
D: This choice involves the time of day when Internet traffic is highest and where it originates from. It is not directly analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
E: This choice involves the cheetah's speed over short and long distances. It is not directly analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the interpretation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans, which are used to study brain activity.
  FMRI scans involve a subtraction method, in which the baseline measurement of brain activity is subtracted from the measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
  The result of this subtraction is assumed to represent the brain activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  The FMRI subtraction method is analogous to the scenario described in option B, where a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer. Just as the increase in shoppers during the summer was attributed to the advertising campaign, the differential brain activity observed in FMRI scans is attributed to the cognitive task being performed. Both situations involve a subtraction or comparison method to isolate the effect of one variable (advertising, cognitive task) on an outcome (number of shoppers, brain activity).
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the limitations of using FMRI scans to study the brain, and how the subtractive method used to interpret them can produce misleading results. 
  The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Action: Answer("B") 
Choice B is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted. In both cases, a change is observed in one condition (i.e. an increase in shoppers during the summer or a change in oxygen use during a cognitive task), and the conclusion is drawn that the change is due solely to the factor of interest (i.e. the advertising campaign or the cognitive task). However, there may be other factors at play (i.e. increased free time during the summer or the brain's overall metabolic activity), which are not taken into account.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the interpretation of FMRI scans and how they are the result of subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while a subject is performing a cognitive task. The remaining activity is assumed to be associated solely with the cognitive task, but this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  
A: This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans. 
B: This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
C: This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
D: This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
E: This is analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans because it highlights a situation where a particular attribute is only true under certain conditions (i.e. cheetahs being the fastest land animals is only true for short distances, not long distances). Similarly, the FMRI scans only show which areas of the brain are active during a specific cognitive task, but the entire brain is active in both the control and task conditions.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted, as well as some of the problems with this method of interpretation.
  A: This choice is about a particular district in a city that voted for a new mayor and how the margin of victory in that district impacted the election. It is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  B: This choice is about a store's advertising campaign and how it affected shoppers during the summer months. It is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  C: This choice is about the impact of droughts on the water supply, and how agricultural customers are affected more than residential customers. It is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  D: This choice is about the time of day when Internet traffic is highest, and where most of this traffic originates. It is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  E: This choice is about the cheetah and its speed over short and long distances. It is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of interpreting FMRI brain scans as revealing distinct, modular regions of the brain associated with specific mental functions. The FMRI method actually shows differential oxygen use between a baseline control condition and a specific cognitive task, but this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. This subtractive method produces impressive images of localized brain activity, but the modular theory of mind may not be valid, and the brain may not be decomposable into independent modules.
  
  A: This analogy involves identifying one district that provided a crucial margin of victory for a candidate, but it does not relate to the subtractive method used in FMRI scans.
  B: This analogy involves attributing an increase in summer shoppers to a yearlong advertising campaign, but it does not relate to the subtractive method used in FMRI scans.
  C: This analogy involves noting that agricultural customers use more water than residential customers, but it does not relate to the subtractive method used in FMRI scans.
  D: This analogy involves observing that Internet traffic is highest during evening hours and originates primarily from homes rather than office buildings, but it does not relate to the subtractive method used in FMRI scans.
  E: This analogy involves noting that cheetahs are the fastest land animal only for short distances, but it does not relate to the subtractive method used in FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology as a research method, which relies on the premise that mental activity can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules.
  Brain scans, such as FMRI, reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks, but the entire brain is active in both control and task conditions, and the subtractive method used to interpret FMRI scans can produce a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The question asks for an analogy to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  The FMRI scan is interpreted by taking a baseline measurement in a control condition and a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task, and then subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement. The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. This is analogous to the way in which the increased number of shoppers in the summer is attributed solely to an advertising campaign that was launched a year earlier, ignoring other factors that may have contributed to the increase.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the interpretation of FMRI brain scans in the context of the modular theory of mind, which posits that distinct mental processes are localized in specific regions of the brain.
  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI scan is actually the result of a subtraction, where the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  The entire brain is active in both conditions, so the subtractive method used in interpreting FMRI scans produces a false impression of neat functional localization.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  The manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is most analogous to the way a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. In both cases, an effect is inferred from a change in a particular condition, while ignoring other factors that may have contributed to the change. In the case of FMRI scans, the differential rate of oxygen use is used to infer which parts of the brain are active during a particular cognitive task, while ignoring the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. Similarly, the store owner inferred that the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers, while ignoring other factors that may have contributed to the change in shopping behavior.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  The interpretation involves a subtraction method that subtracts a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task. The resulting image is interpreted as revealing the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The passage argues that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and cognitive task conditions, which can give a false impression of neat functional localization.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: Option B involves interpreting an increase in shoppers only during the summer as having been affected only the summer shoppers, which is similar to the interpretation of the FMRI scans as revealing the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the different categories of chemical substances in plants, their roles and the evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. The text explains how secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and how natural selection favors substances that attract pollinating insects or that act as biochemical defenses against enemies of plants like insects. The competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances and also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.

The passage also describes how these secondary substances are favored by natural selection and compete with plant-eating insects. 

A: This choice accurately describes one aspect of the main point of the passage, but not the main point itself.
B: This choice accurately describes an aspect of the main point of the passage, but not the main point itself. 
C: This choice accurately expresses the main point of the passage by stating that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
D: This choice accurately describes an aspect of the secondary substances in plants, but not the main point of the passage.
E: This choice accurately describes one aspect of the main point of the passage, but not the main point itself.

Therefore, the answer is "C".
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the two categories of chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary. Secondary substances are diverse and give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Secondary substances arose due to genetic mutations and are favored by natural selection either because they attract pollinators or because they provide biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects. There has been an evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects, with insects evolving ways to circumvent the plants' defenses and to identify suitable food sources by their characteristic flavors or odors.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")

The main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances found in different plants, which give them distinctive tastes and smells, result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. The passage describes how some of these secondary substances evolved as biochemical defenses against insects, while others evolved as scents to attract pollinating insects. It also describes how insects have evolved different ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. Therefore, choice C most accurately expresses the main point of the passage.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances, and how these substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. It also discusses the role of insects in the evolution of secondary substances in plants and how natural selection has favored those substances that provide defenses against insects. The competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of suitable food sources for any one species of insect.

  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and are a result of genetic mutations and natural selection. 
  Insects play a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. 
  There has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. 

Analysis:
  The main point of the passage is to describe the relationship between plants and insects with regard to the evolution of secondary substances in plants. The passage explains that insects play a major role in the development of the distinctive tastes and smells of plants, and that this has occurred through an evolutionary interaction between plants and insects. 

Answer("C") is the best choice because it accurately reflects the main point of the passage.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, with a focus on primary and secondary substances. Secondary substances are responsible for the distinctive taste and smell of plants and are involved in a variety of relationships with insects. Insects play a role in the development and conservation of secondary substances, acting as both pollinators and pests. Over time, evolutionary pressures have led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant. 

Answering the Question: 
The main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. This is discussed extensively throughout the passage, and the other answer choices do not accurately capture the main point. Choice A is too narrow in its focus, discussing only the role of secondary substances as natural defenses against insects. Choice B is partially correct, but it focuses too much on the narrowing of the range of secondary substances and insect species, while ignoring the evolutionary process that led to this narrowing. Choice D is partially correct, but it places too much emphasis on the similarity of secondary substances among closely related species, while ignoring the role of evolutionary pressures from insects. Choice E is incorrect, as it does not accurately reflect the main point of the passage, which is the evolutionary interaction between plants and insects. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and the role of secondary substances in giving plants their distinctive tastes and smells. It also describes the evolutionary competition between plants and insects, and the role of secondary substances in plant defense against insects.
  
A: This choice accurately describes the role of secondary substances in plant defense against insects, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage.
B: This choice accurately describes the effect of long-term competition on the range of secondary substances present in plants and the range of insect species that eat each species of plant, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?

  E: Both authors assert that their positions are supported by data. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses a paradox regarding happiness and wealth, and how people compare their income with some norm that rises along with actual income. It also discusses habituation and rivalry, which push up the norm people compare themselves with. The majority of people in a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway chose a lower income level that improved their relative position. People compare themselves with their "reference group" for happiness. 
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful and that they have created value. The happiness comes from the success, not the money itself. People use material wealth to show that they are prosperous and create value. Wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B argue that money can buy happiness, but in different ways.
  A: Passage A argues that people's happiness depends on how they compare their income with others in their society, and that people's happiness can be affected by habituation and rivalry.
  B: Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful and they have created value.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Passage B differs from passage A in that analogous displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more
Choices:
  A: engaged
  B: dismissive
  C: detached
  D: ironic
  E: skeptical
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the implications of a neuroscientific viewpoint for the law, and suggests that the law should focus on deterrence, rather than retribution. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism, and distinguishes between free and constrained actions. 
  Neither passage clearly displays an attitude of engagement, dismissiveness, detachment, irony, or skepticism toward the ideas they discuss. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A suggests that the viewpoint of neuroscientists radically changes the way we think about the law. It argues that people may not be making free and rational moral choices and suggests that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism. It argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources. It discusses the theory of "soft determinism" and suggests that actions and wills that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained and therefore free.
Action: Answer("C") 
The attitude displayed in Passage B is more detached than Passage A. Passage B is discussing a philosophical concept and presents it in a more objective and analytical way, whereas Passage A has a more engaged and provocative tone as it presents a new viewpoint that challenges the dominant justification of punishment in the criminal justice system.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A suggests that a neuroscientific perspective on human behavior challenges traditional ideas of retribution and punishment in the legal system. 
  Passage B discusses the compatibility of determinism and free will, arguing that actions stemming from internal sources can still be considered free.
  The question asks for a comparison of the attitudes in the two passages. 
Action: Answer("C") 
Passage A and Passage B approach the topic of neuroscience and its implications for human behavior and the law from different angles. Passage A argues for a specific change in the legal system, while Passage B engages with a philosophical debate. Passage B does not dismiss neuroscience or determinism, but instead offers a nuanced perspective on how free will can still coexist with determinism. The tone in Passage B is detached and analytical, rather than skeptical or dismissive. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: detached.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that the operations of the brain determine behavior, and suggests that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and argues that actions can still be considered free even in a deterministic world.
Action: Answer("C") 
Passage B is more detached than Passage A. Passage A argues for a specific approach to the criminal justice system based on the assumption that the brain determines behavior, while Passage B discusses a philosophical concept and argues for a specific interpretation of it.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A discusses recent findings in neuroscience and how it challenges the traditional way of thinking about law. It suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing bad people. 
  The passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it coexists with determinism. It suggests that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. 
  There is no indication in passage B that it displays an attitude that is dismissive, ironic or engaged towards the ideas it discusses.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the idea that behavior is caused by the operations of the brain, which has implications for the legal system. It suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution and focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism. It argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, and that actions and wills that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained and therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A suggests that the operations of the brain are responsible for behavior, and that this understanding should lead the criminal-justice system to focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing bad people. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it can coexist with determinism, proposing a theory of "soft determinism" that distinguishes between free and constrained actions. 
  There is no indication that Passage B is dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical towards the ideas it discusses. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that the operations of the brain cause our behavior and that this means that the criminal justice system should focus on deterrence instead of retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world, and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  Passage A is arguing for a specific change in the criminal justice system, while Passage B is discussing a philosophical concept. Passage B presents a theory and discusses it objectively, without expressing any particularly strong attitude towards it. None of the answer choices suggest a neutral attitude, but "detached" comes closest to the tone of Passage B.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that neuroscience changes the way we think about the law. It suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of punishing bad people for their immoral acts.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education: 
  - The first proposal advocates teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture's methods, perspectives, and values of liberalism.
  - The second proposal advocates taking on each culture on its own terms, but still using Western methods to study them, which some critics argue is still value-laden and distorting.
  The strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would need to refute the claim that Western scientific methods are not suitable for understanding non-Western cultures and that adopting non-scientific perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied is necessary for real understanding.
  
A: This choice is irrelevant to the objection raised in the passage.
B: This choice is also irrelevant to the objection raised in the passage.
C: This choice suggests that some non-Western societies do use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, but it does not address the objection raised in the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it explores emotional states that music had not recorded before. 
A: This answer choice describes a comedian whose material is vulgar, but it does not necessarily connect to the idea of exploring emotional states in a new way.
B: This answer choice describes a comedian whose humor explores aspects of human nature that are often ignored. This could be seen as analogous to Schoenberg's music, as both are attempting to explore new emotional territory.
C: This answer choice describes a comedian whose material is not original. This is not analogous to Schoenberg's music, as his music is described as exploring new emotional states.
D: This answer choice describes a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy. This is not analogous to Schoenberg's music, as the focus is on emotional exploration, not political expression.
E: This answer choice describes a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience. This is not necessarily analogous to Schoenberg's music, as the focus is on emotional exploration, not unfamiliarity. 

Action: Answer("B")

Action: Answer("B") 
Choice B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54. Both Schoenberg's music and this type of comedy deal with difficult truths that are not often acknowledged, and they can be challenging for audiences to confront.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  A: This choice is not the best answer because vulgar humor is not necessarily disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  B: This choice is the best answer because it describes a comedian whose humor illuminates difficult truths in a way that is similar to the way that Schoenberg's music illuminates difficult emotional states.
  C: This choice is not the best answer because it describes a comedian whose material is not original, but it does not describe a comedian whose material is disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  D: This choice is not the best answer because it describes a comedian whose material expresses a political philosophy, but it does not describe a comedian whose material is disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
  D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  E: "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage provides information about corridos, a type of narrative folk song that comes from the Lower Rio Grande Border region. Corridos flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s and are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. Corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. The corrido takes its name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. The passage also discusses a specific corrido, "El Corrido de Kiansis," and "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," and provides information about the standard generic elements of corridos.
  
A: The passage does not provide support for this inference.
B: The passage mentions "El Corrido de Kiansis," the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, but it does not provide support for most surviving corridos not existing in complete form.
C: The passage provides support for this inference. All complete corridos have some lines in common, especially in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida.
D: The passage provides support for this inference. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
E: The passage does not provide support for this inference. The passage indicates that "El Corrido de Kiansis" records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s and is one of the oldest corridos. However, there is no information about who composed it.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage describes how prions are a new type of protein pathogen that reproduce themselves abnormally and cause degenerative neurological conditions such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). It also states that there are currently no effective therapies for preventing the reproduction process of affected prions and that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves have yet to be completely understood. 

Analysis: Based on the given knowledge, the author would be least likely to agree with choice B because the passage clearly states that CJD is inevitably fatal and that there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.

Explanation: The passage describes CJD as a degenerative disease that causes nerve cell destruction in the brain and is inevitably fatal. There is no mention of any patients currently infected with CJD recovering from the disease. Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with choice B.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans, and the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen that can reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. There is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, and CJD is inevitably fatal. The exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction are not completely understood.
  
A: The passage indicates that the presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is indeed a sign of neurological disease. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement. 
B: The passage does not suggest that any patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. Therefore, the author may not agree with this statement. 
C: The passage explains that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement. 
D: The passage explains that the body does not produce an immune response to prions when they are present. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement. 
E: The passage explains that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions, a type of protein pathogen that lacks nucleic acid, as the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. The pathogenic conformation of prions induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation, reproducing themselves in a chain reaction that ultimately destroys nerve cells. There is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, and CJD is inevitably fatal. The exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage indicates that there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, and CJD is inevitably fatal. Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with choice B, which states that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen that can cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. Prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into a dangerous abnormal shape. Because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. In the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal.
  
A: The passage supports this statement.
B: The passage contradicts this statement. It is stated that CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses, but there is no mention of recovery.
C: The passage supports this statement.
D: The passage supports this statement.
E: The passage supports this statement.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author describes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and the discovery of prions as the infectious agent that causes it.
  Prions are a type of protein pathogen that lacks nucleic acid.
  The prions convert their structures into an abnormal shape, which can reproduce themselves and lead to the destruction of nerve cells in the brain.
  The body does not produce an immune response against prions.
  CJD is inevitably fatal and there is currently no effective therapy to prevent it.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so it is unlikely that the author would agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. Therefore, Answer("B") is the correct answer. The other options are all supported by the passage.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a disease caused by a protein pathogen called a prion. Prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce by inducing normally shaped prions to transform into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. The body does not produce an immune response to prions, and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. CJD is inevitably fatal, and there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
  A: The passage discusses how prions reproduce and cause cellular destruction in the brain, leading to the symptoms of CJD, which include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. The presence of abnormal prions in brain tissue is a key feature of the disease.
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, with wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. There is currently no cure for CJD.
  C: The passage discusses how prions reproduce by inducing normally shaped prions to transform into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. Prions lack nucleic acid but are able to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way.
  D: The passage states that prions occur naturally in the body as proteins and do not produce an immune response when present. The body has no natural defense against CJD, and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
  E: The passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

  The passage explains the utility maximization principle, which holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility, given a choice of actions. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  A: The waiter in this scenario is concealing his tip income to reduce his taxes, which would result in an increased expected utility from his action. Therefore, this scenario is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  B: The motorist in this scenario is avoiding speeding on a heavily-patrolled road to avoid a speeding ticket and loss of her driver's license, which would result in an increased cost to her if caught. Therefore, this scenario is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  C: The industrialist in this scenario is continuing to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant because the cost of treatment would exceed the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. This scenario is also a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the industrialist is weighing the cost of treatment against the cost of the fine and choosing the action that maximizes their expected utility.
  D: The government official in this scenario is risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because of rampant inflation that has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. This scenario is also a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the official is choosing the action that maximizes their expected utility given the circumstances.
  E: The worker in this scenario is physically assaulting his former supervisor because of being dismissed from his job and believing that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This scenario is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because the worker is not weighing the costs and benefits of his actions and is instead acting impulsively and emotionally.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.

The passage states that Schoenberg pushed unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis, which is a departure from the late-Romantic manner. The third style, which developed the 12-tone technique, is a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. Since the first style was late-Romantic manner with shifting chromatic harmonies, the third style can be seen as a natural progression from the first style.
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage describes three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. The first style was late-Romantic, with shifting chromatic harmonies. The second style featured unstable harmonies that no longer had a tonal basis. The third style was the 12-tone technique, which brought a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilized it.
  
Analysis: The passage suggests that Schoenberg's three styles were part of a natural progression in the historical development of music. The author also praises Schoenberg's technical mastery and ability to precisely delineate emotional states that had not been recorded before. The author does not suggest that Schoenberg's departure from tonal music was inexplicable, but rather that it was a necessary step in the development of music.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10)
  C: "markedly inclusive" (line 16)
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24)
  E: "alien to the European style" (line 51)
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that focused only on written documents produced through European-style autobiographical writing. It argues that this approach overlooks traditional modes of communicating personal history in Native American cultures, which were more inclusive and relational, and often involved oral forms of expression such as songs, stories, and performances.

Analysis: The question asks for the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies. To answer this question, we need to look for clues in the passage that reveal the author's opinion or perspective on this topic.

Action: Answer("A")

The correct answer is A because the phrase "failed to address" (line 9) implies that the author is critical of the earlier scholarship for overlooking important aspects of Native American autobiographical expression. The other phrases in the answer choices describe aspects of Native American culture or expression that are discussed in the passage, but do not necessarily indicate the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies. The author argues that scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communication and failed to address the cultural constructs of the diverse Native American peoples. The author also suggests that the European concept of autobiography, which underlies the English word's root meaning, is not applicable to all pre-contact Native American cultures. The author describes these cultures as inclusive, and the expression of life experiences as being oriented toward current events and involving language, speech, signs, dance, and drama. The author suggests that oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. 

A: "failed to address" is used to describe the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies, but it does not convey the author's attitude toward that scholarship.
B: "highly diverse" is used to describe the Native American peoples, but it does not convey the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
C: "markedly inclusive" is used to describe pre-contact Native American cultures, and the author suggests that this idea of self was markedly inclusive, but it does not convey the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
D: "seemingly more fragmented" is used to describe the mode of autobiography in some pre-contact Native American cultures, but it does not convey the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
E: "alien to the European style" is used to describe the intercultural collaboration that may have shaped early Native American autobiographies, but it does not convey the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the limitations of most scholarship on Native American autobiographies, which has focused on written, bicultural composite authorship and overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history, as well as the cultural constructs and perspectives of the diverse Native American peoples.
A: "Failed to address" is a neutral phrase that simply describes a limitation of the earlier scholarship, so it does not convey the author's attitude toward it.
B: "Highly diverse" is also a neutral phrase that simply describes the Native American peoples, so it does not convey the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
C: "Markedly inclusive" is a positive phrase that contrasts with the European assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography. However, it does not directly convey the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
D: "Seemingly more fragmented" is a neutral phrase that describes a mode of autobiography in some pre-contact Native American cultures that contrasts with the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. However, it does not directly convey the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
E: "Alien to the European style" is a negative phrase that suggests that the intercultural collaboration involved in traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history among Native American peoples was not recognized or appreciated by earlier scholarship that focused on bicultural composite authorship. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how most scholars studying Native American autobiographies have overlooked traditional modes of communicating personal history and have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples. The author also notes that traditional Native American modes of autobiography were markedly inclusive and tended to be oriented toward current events, rather than the recollections of a lifetime. The author also suggests that any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the intended audience, and that early Native American autobiographical expressions may have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
  
Action: Answer("A")

  The passage discusses earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies and critiques it for focusing on written documents that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators and for overlooking traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. 
  A: The phrase "failed to address" is used to describe the earlier scholarship's treatment of the cultural constructs of Native American peoples and their traditional modes of communicating personal history. It conveys a negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship's limited scope. 
  B: The phrase "highly diverse" is used to describe the Native American peoples that the earlier scholarship failed to fully consider. It does not convey a clear attitude toward the earlier scholarship. 
  C: The phrase "markedly inclusive" is used to describe the idea of self in some pre-contact Native American cultures, which was not merely individual but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. It does not convey a clear attitude toward the earlier scholarship. 
  D: The phrase "seemingly more fragmented" is used to describe the mode of autobiography in some pre-contact Native American cultures, which tended to be oriented toward current events rather than the recollections of a lifetime. It does not convey a clear attitude toward the earlier scholarship. 
  E: The phrase "alien to the European style" is used to describe the intercultural collaboration that characterized some pre-contact Native American modes of autobiography. It conveys a difference between these modes and the European style of autobiography, but it does not convey a clear attitude toward the earlier scholarship. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how most scholars who have studied Native American autobiographies have focused on written documents that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators and have thus overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. The author argues that these scholars have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples and that they have made assumptions about self, life, and writing that do not apply to these cultures. The author suggests that traditional Native American modes of autobiography were more inclusive, fragmented, and reliant on language and other forms of expression, such as dance, drama, tattoos, and artifacts.
Action: Answer("A")  
The author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage is critical or negative. The phrase "failed to address" (line 9) suggests that these scholars have overlooked important aspects of the subject matter and have not done justice to the cultural diversity and complexity of Native American peoples.
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that focused on written accounts and overlooked traditional preliterate modes of communication, which were more inclusive and involved the participation of the tribe. The passage also notes that the earlier scholarship failed to address the cultural constructs of Native American peoples and how these constructs shaped their autobiographical expressions. The author's attitude is expressed in the way they present this information.
Action: Answer("A")  
The phrase "failed to address" (line 9) suggests that the author is critical of the earlier scholarship for overlooking important aspects of Native American autobiographies.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale, which allow bigger firms to achieve lower costs than smaller firms, create a natural tendency toward monopoly. This contradicts Adam Smith's idea of the invisible hand, which requires many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power.
  A: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. The fact that some businesses can exert monopoly power in one region does not mean that bigger firms do not tend to drive smaller firms out of business and create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C: This statement reinforces the connection between increased size and monopoly power. If businesses collude when an industry is dominated by only a few players, they are effectively acting as a monopoly and exerting monopoly power.
  D: This statement could potentially undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. If the size that a business must reach in order to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, then it is less likely that bigger firms will tend to drive smaller firms out of business and create a natural tendency toward monopoly. However, this statement does not provide enough information to definitively undermine the author's argument.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The author argues that the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand is a contradiction inherent in economic theory since Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations in 1776. The Pin Factory represents the idea that there are increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand represents how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." The author further argues that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. The idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. 
A: This choice does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it acknowledges the existence of monopoly power in some industries. 
B: This choice is irrelevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
C: This choice supports the idea that increasing size leads to monopoly power, as it suggests that businesses that dominate an industry may act like a true monopoly. 
D: This choice does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it acknowledges that the size that a business must reach to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. 
E: This choice supports the idea that there are limits to how much productivity can be gained from increased specialization, but it does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized, because it was easier to represent mathematically. The author argues that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.

So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, it would suggest that not all industries will naturally lead to monopolies as they grow larger. This would undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power. Therefore, choice (D) is the correct answer.

Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
A: This statement does not address the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It only notes that there are some industries where businesses are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
B: This statement is about the effect of increased specialization on worker salaries, and does not address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This statement supports the argument that increased size leads to monopoly power, as it suggests that businesses collude when an industry is dominated by only a few players.
D: This statement challenges the assumption that returns to scale are the same across industries, but does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
E: This statement does not address the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It only suggests that there may be other factors that limit the gains in productivity achieved by making workers more specialized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, but for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry.
  A: The existence of regional monopolies does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as a business could dominate a region and still face competition in other regions.
  B: The fact that specialized workers may not be able to command as high a salary as generalists is not related to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C: The author acknowledges that businesses may collude to set prices even if they are not true monopolies, but this does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  D: This answer choice does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as the author acknowledges that the size required to achieve increasing returns varies from industry to industry.
  E: This answer choice does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it only suggests that there may be other factors to consider when increasing specialization.

Response 7:
Knowledge: The author argues that increasing returns to scale tend to drive smaller firms out of business, leading to monopoly. The invisible hand of the market depends on many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Diminishing returns to scale allow for many competitors in each industry, while increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power. The author suggests that until the late 1970s, economics assumed that returns to scale were diminishing, but that increasing returns to scale are now recognized as playing an important role in economic thought. 
A: This answer choice does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It suggests that in some industries, larger businesses do not have monopoly power, but it does not address the general tendency for larger businesses to have monopoly power due to increasing returns to scale. 
B: This answer choice is also unrelated to the author's argument. It discusses the effect of specialization on worker pay, but it does not address whether or not increasing returns to scale tend to lead to monopoly power. 
C: This answer choice supports the author's argument by suggesting that when an industry is dominated by a few players, they tend to collude and set prices as high as a true monopoly would. 
D: This answer choice weakens the author's argument by suggesting that the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This implies that not all industries will have a tendency towards monopoly as they grow larger. 
E: This answer choice does not address the relationship between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power. It discusses the trade-off between productivity gains and other costs associated with specialized workers. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that there is a contradiction inherent in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Smith's Pin Factory emphasizes the huge increases in efficiency that can be achieved through increased size, yet increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly. The Invisible Hand depends on many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. 
A: This statement is a critique of the Invisible Hand, but it does not directly undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
B: This statement is related to the Pin Factory, but it does not directly undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This statement reinforces the idea that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, and therefore supports the author's argument.
D: If the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, then it is less likely that larger firms will tend to drive smaller firms out of business, which undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
E: This statement is related to the Pin Factory, but it does not directly undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. This can lead to domination of the industry by just a few players and undermine the invisible hand. The assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries and the economics of increasing returns are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. 
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If the size required to achieve increased returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, it would suggest that the relationship between increased size and monopoly power is not a general one and may not hold true in all cases. This would undermine the argument that increasing returns to scale necessarily lead to monopoly power, and thus undermine the connection the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature

  D: The passage states that "Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source" but also that "The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted 'as it is' was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it." This suggests that Dostoyevsky did not believe that realism in fact facilitated the exposure of social inequities or contributed to the creation of a new society.
  E: The passage states that "As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source." This suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that reality is the crucial source of successful literature.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on the role of reality and fantasy in literature, as well as his opposition to the radical critics' view that literature must serve a particular political purpose. 
  A: This is true. Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person experiencing it and that reality was not independent of the experiences of individuals.
  B: While Dostoyevsky did not believe that literature should serve a particular political purpose, the passage does not suggest that he believed realism was unequal to the task of representing political views.
  C: This is not true. Dostoyevsky believed that reality was a crucial source of successful literature.
  D: This is not entirely true. While Dostoyevsky did not believe that literature should serve a particular political purpose or be used as a tool for exposing social inequities, he did not reject the idea that literature could contribute to the creation of a new society.
  E: This is not true. Dostoyevsky believed that reality was a crucial source of successful literature.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky rejected the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is," since reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it. For him, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. 

Action: Answer("D")  
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' understanding of reality because he believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. Therefore, Dostoyevsky believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. 
Option A: This is consistent with Dostoyevsky's view of reality as being shaped by the person who experienced it, and that reality was far more than the merely tangible. Hence, this option is correct. 
Option B: The passage does not state that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because it was unequal to the task of representing political views. Hence, this option is incorrect. 
Option C: The passage mentions that one position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, but this was not Dostoyevsky's view. Hence, this option is incorrect. 
Option D: The passage does not state that Dostoyevsky believed that realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society. Hence, this option is incorrect. 
Option E: The passage explains that Dostoyevsky was a realist who never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. Hence, this option is incorrect.

Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on literary criticism in Russia during his time.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of literature, but he had a deeper understanding of reality than the radical critics. He believed that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. He believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." 
Option A is supported by the passage, as Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it. Option B is not supported by the passage, as Dostoyevsky did not believe that realism was unequal to the task of representing political views. Option C is not supported by the passage, as Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of literature. Option D is partially supported by the passage, as Dostoyevsky did not believe that realism alone facilitated the exposure of social inequities or contributed to the creation of a new society. Option E is not supported by the passage, as Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of literature.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  One position maintained that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality, while the radical view maintained that art should find its sources in concrete reality.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position and believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  For Dostoyevsky, reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit" because only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.

Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains the concept of jury nullification and argues that the jury's power to nullify creates problems. The author argues that we do not know how often nullification occurs, juries often lack sufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, and that juries are not legislators.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, and that when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it is performing a useful function. The author argues that instances of nullification where a jury is persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore are likely to be uncommon.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by the jury's power to nullify.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

  The passage is about the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, who showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  The passage also describes how the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  The passage concludes with the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Based on the passage, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. This is because CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, which is devastating to the ozone layer. Therefore, testing to see if a particular chemical would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would help to determine whether the chemical would have a similar effect on the ozone layer as CFCs.

Based on the passage, the most useful experiment to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer would be testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation. This is because the depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the breakdown of CFCs into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when they are subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, testing a chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would help determine if that chemical would have a similar effect on the ozone layer as CFCs.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs.
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat.
  The Montreal Protocol of 1987 was developed to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Based on the passage, the information yielded by testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 
  Molina and Rowland showed that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  They observed that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. 
  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  Molina and Rowland's research led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
Analysis:
  The question asks which experiment would be the most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Answer choice A does not provide information relevant to this question. 
  Answer choice B does not provide information relevant to this question.
  Answer choice C is relevant because chlorine is the element that causes the damage to the ozone layer. If a chemical reacts with chlorine, it could potentially cause harm to the ozone layer. 
  Answer choice D does not provide information relevant to this question. 
  Answer choice E is also relevant because if a chemical breaks down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, it could release elements that could cause harm to the ozone layer.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how CFCs deplete the ozone layer by releasing chlorine, which reacts with ozone and destroys it.
  The passage also discusses the importance of the ozone layer in protecting against ultraviolet radiation.
  The passage mentions a ban on CFCs and the development of more environmentally friendly alternatives.

Action: Answer("C")  
Based on the passage, testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. This is because the depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the release of chlorine from CFCs, which reacts with ozone and destroys it. If a replacement chemical were to react with chlorine in the same way, it would also be damaging to the ozone layer. Therefore, testing to determine whether the chemical would react with chlorine would be important in assessing its potential impact on the ozone layer.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the damage to the ozone layer caused by CFCs.
  The passage mentions that the ozone layer is a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland showed that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The passage talks about Molina and Rowland advocating for a public policy response to the depletion of the ozone layer.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Based on the passage, the most useful information for determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer would be testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation. This is because Molina and Rowland showed that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere, and the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Therefore, testing to see if a chemical would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would help determine whether it could potentially cause damage to the ozone layer.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the effects of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer and the need to find a replacement that would not damage the ozone layer.
  A: The passage does not discuss the reaction of chemicals with forms of oxygen other than ozone.
  B: The passage does not discuss the reaction of replacement chemicals with other chemicals in the lower atmosphere.
  C: The passage mentions that CFCs chemically react with chlorine, which is devastating to the ozone layer.
  D: The passage does not suggest that finding chemical properties common to chlorine would be useful in finding a replacement for CFCs.
  E: The passage mentions that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to ultraviolet radiation. However, the question asks specifically about testing a replacement chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  - Stratospheric ozone layer screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  - CFCs attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  - Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  - Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  - Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  The passage explains how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, and how this breakdown is devastating to the ozone layer. Therefore, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science, concerning the power of negative evidence.
  The passage B explains how astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet based on the orbit of Uranus and Mercury, which did not match their predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Disturbing forces are one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists use to derive a theory's predictions. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, which concerns the power of negative evidence. Popper argues that negative evidence is more powerful than positive evidence, and that scientific research involves searching for evidence that would disprove theories. 
  Passage B discusses the discovery of the planet Uranus, the subsequent failed prediction of the orbit of Uranus, and the discovery of the planet Neptune to correct the prediction, as well as the prediction of the orbit of Mercury, the failed prediction of Vulcan, and the eventual acceptance of Einstein's theory of relativity. 
  A, B, C, D, and E are celestial objects mentioned in passage B. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes that scientists almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one.
  Passage B describes that when the astronomers made their predictions about Uranus's orbit, they based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. 
Action: Answer("C") 
Choice C, Neptune, is the correct answer. In Passage B, the astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets when they made their predictions about Uranus's orbit, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Scientists later discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations. The existence of Neptune, a disturbing force, caused the original predictions about Uranus's orbit to be incorrect.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science and the power of negative evidence. Popper maintains that scientific research involves not only generating bold theories but also searching for evidence that would disprove them.

  Passage B discusses how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus and Mercury based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. When their predictions did not match their observations, they hypothesized the existence of other planets to explain the discrepancies.
  
Analysis:
  The question asks to identify the example of a disturbing force from Passage A in Passage B. According to Passage A, disturbing forces are one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists need to consider when deriving predictions from scientific theories. Therefore, we need to look for an example of a force or factor that could have affected the predictions made by astronomers in Passage B.

Solution:
  A: Uranus is not an example of a disturbing force in Passage B.
  B: The sun is not an example of a disturbing force in Passage B.
  C: Neptune is not an example of a disturbing force in Passage B.
  D: Mercury is the planet whose orbit was predicted based on Newton's laws in Passage B, but the question asks for an example of a disturbing force, not a planet whose orbit was predicted.
  E: The moon is not mentioned in Passage B.

Therefore, none of the choices accurately represents a disturbing force as described in Passage A. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes that scientists almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises to derive a theory's predictions, which include the correct functioning of instrumentation, the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  Passage B describes that when astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus, they made auxiliary assumptions about the existence of other planets, which proved to be false. They changed their auxiliary assumptions and hypothesized the existence of another planet, which was later discovered.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  In Passage B, the auxiliary assumption that there were no planets in the vicinity of Uranus proved to be false. This incorrect assumption led to the failure of the prediction of Uranus's orbit, which had to be corrected by hypothesizing the existence of another planet (Neptune). Therefore, the incorrect assumption about the existence of other planets can be considered a disturbing force, as described in Passage A. The other options (A, B, D, and E) are not related to the description of a disturbing force in Passage A.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes that auxiliary premises that appeal to other theories and to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. can be needed to derive a theory's predictions. It also mentions that when an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to
Choices:
  A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life

Action: Answer("A")  
Based on the passage, the author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings primarily to show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Roy Lichtenstein's work, which merged comic book style with fine art and conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The objects and themes appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings were reflections of the culture he inhabited. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them an inner sweetness.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes Lichtenstein's paintings and how they were influenced by comic book styles and conventions.
  A: The author does mention that Lichtenstein's paintings depict aspects of contemporary life, but this is not the primary reason for listing the themes and objects in his paintings.
  B: The author does not support the claim that Lichtenstein's work was parodic in intent, but rather argues that his paintings possessed an impulse toward realism and conveyed a seriousness of theme.
  C: The author does contrast Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism, but this is not the primary purpose of listing the themes and objects in Lichtenstein's paintings.
  D: Answer("A") The author suggests that the themes and objects in Lichtenstein's paintings reflect the culture he inhabited and depict contemporary life, indicating that the primary reason for listing them is to show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life.
  E: The author does not endorse Lichtenstein's attitude toward consumer culture, but rather describes how his work exuded a deliberate naivete and a faith in reconciliation.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle and how it can be used to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. The principle holds that people will choose the action that maximizes their overall satisfaction, or expected utility, and that the expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. The passage also suggests that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, can deter crime because it lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how legal scholars are using the economic principle of utility maximization to understand the decision-making process behind deliberate crimes. The principle suggests that people weigh the costs and benefits of their actions and choose the action that maximizes their overall satisfaction. Crime deterrence methods that increase the cost of criminal activity, such as stronger penalties and law enforcement, and methods that increase the benefit of lawful activity, such as increased economic opportunities, can both affect an individual's expected utility and therefore deter crime.

Action: Answer("D")  
According to the passage, legal scholars are using evidence from economics to support their positions on crime deterrence. Choice D is the only option that involves using evidence from another field to support a decision in a legal case, making it the most similar scenario.

  Other scholars believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. They suggest changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced an economic principle, utility maximization, that shows that the two positions are complementary.
  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. 
  The decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage presents an argument that the two positions in the crime deterrence debate (changing societal norms and institutions vs. increasing fines and penalties) can be reconciled by the utility maximization principle, which holds that people will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  A: This scenario is about using a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies. This does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  B: This scenario is about a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other. This does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  C: This scenario is about a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest. This does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  D: This scenario is about a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. This does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  E: This scenario is about a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session. This does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle to analyze the rational economic choice behind committing a deliberate crime.
  A: The passage does not mention astronomers, ancient cosmologists, or new technologies.
  B: The passage does not mention drawing instructors, laws of optics, or lines that appear to diverge but run parallel to each other.
  C: The passage does not mention botanists, legendary Olympic athletes, or the competitive nature of plants in a forest.
  D: The passage discusses the use of evidence from economics to support legal scholars' approach to the crime deterrence debate, which is similar to the judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case.
  E: The passage does not mention mediators, quotations from novels, or attempts to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at a bargaining session.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939, recognizing that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  The products of the neutron-bombardment experiments remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  The minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials hampered precise chemical analyses.
  Meitner and Hahn communicated and collaborated on their research despite being in different locations.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: According to the information in the passage, the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had the expectation that the by-products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Choice B suggests that if the physicists did not have these particular expectations, they would have been more likely to realize that atoms were being split. Therefore, Answer("B") is the most likely answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which was achieved through neutron bombardment of uranium. 
  The physicists compiling evidence for nuclear fission did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939. 
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data and coined the term "nuclear fission." 
  The physicists had not been receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms through neutron bombardment, and they had not recognized the significance of the by-products produced by the experiments.
   
A: The passage does not provide information about the research techniques used by physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium. This answer choice is not relevant to the question.
B: The passage indicates that physicists had expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products and that this expectation contributed to the delay in recognizing the significance of the experiments. This answer choice is the most likely answer. 
C: The passage indicates that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, but the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. This answer choice is not relevant to the question.
D: The passage does not suggest that the concentration of physicists conducting experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. This answer choice is not relevant to the question.
E: The passage focuses on the discovery of nuclear fission through neutron bombardment of uranium. This answer choice is not relevant to the question.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how scientists discovered nuclear fission.
  The scientists who were conducting experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing. They were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. They did not identify the radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium as barium, partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. She coined the term "nuclear fission."
  It became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: According to the passage, the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not recognize what they were witnessing. They did not identify the radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium as barium, partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Therefore, if the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, it would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. Choice B is the correct answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved but without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection for the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  The products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: According to the passage, the physicists' expectation that the by-products would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition hindered their ability to recognize that they were actually splitting uranium atoms. Thus, if the physicists had not had such expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, it would have been easier for them to realize that they were splitting atoms. Choice B is, therefore, the correct answer.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about the discovery of nuclear fission and how long it took for scientists to realize what they were witnessing.
  Physicists conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  The expectation was that the substances would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Meitner was the one who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  
A: The passage does not discuss the techniques used by the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium. Hence, it cannot be determined whether this would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
B: The passage states that one of the reasons why the radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified was because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Hence, if the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, it could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
C: This statement contradicts the information given in the passage. The passage states that "even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart."
D: The passage does not suggest that the number of physicists conducting the experiments was a factor in the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. Hence, it cannot be determined whether this would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
E: The passage does not discuss experiments in neutron bombardment of substances other than uranium. Hence, it cannot be determined whether this would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how scientists amassed increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  The researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in the context of the neutron-bombardment experiments.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was delayed partly because the products of the neutron bombardment were not precisely identified and partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: According to the passage, one of the reasons why the discovery of nuclear fission was delayed was that researchers had expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. Therefore, if the researchers conducting the experiments had not had particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they would have been more likely to recognize that atoms were being split. Answer choice B suggests this.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how physicists amassed increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939, without recognizing what they were witnessing. They compiled evidence that was puzzling, but they did not recognize the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations. It was Lise Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations. When scientists rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: According to the passage, the physicists had certain expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, which prevented them from recognizing that they were splitting atoms. Therefore, it follows that if the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they would have been more likely to realize that atoms were being split at an earlier time. Choice A is irrelevant, as the passage does not provide information on the research techniques being used. Choice C is incorrect, as the passage states that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart. Therefore, the physicists conducting the experiments were aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms. Choice D is incorrect, as the passage does not suggest that more physicists would have led to a quicker realization that atoms were being split. Choice E is also irrelevant, as the passage only focuses on experiments with uranium.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The physicists amassed increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939. 
  Even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that atoms could be split through neutron bombardment of uranium.

  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage states that one of the reasons the physicists did not realize they were splitting atoms was because they had the expectation that the by-products would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Therefore, if they did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, as stated in choice B, they would have been more likely to realize they were splitting atoms, and thus reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize this.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the history of the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Physicists had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved before Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection between observations and the concept of nuclear fission.
  Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving the result of splitting atoms, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  The identification of barium as a product of the uranium neutron bombardment was significant because it indicated that uranium atoms had been split.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data and coined the term "nuclear fission".
  The relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how physicists discovered nuclear fission.
  The physicists discovered nuclear fission by bombarding uranium with neutrons, but did not immediately recognize what they had achieved.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that allowed the physicists to recognize nuclear fission.
A: The fact that physicists were using the same research techniques is not relevant to whether the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split could be reduced.
B: The physicists actually had expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, which led them to overlook the possibility of splitting uranium atoms.
C: Some theoretical physicists had already produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, but the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.
D: The physicists had already compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but did not recognize what they were witnessing. Therefore, more physicists concentrating on obtaining experimental results would not necessarily have reduced the amount of time it took to realize that atoms were being split.
E: The passage only describes experiments in the neutron bombardment of uranium. Experiments with other substances are not mentioned.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?

Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the different positions in Russian literary criticism regarding the purpose and role of literature.
  The first position maintains that art should stand above the present and the everyday.
  The second position maintains that literature should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky takes a third position, which emphasizes the importance of reality as a source for literature, but expands the definition of reality to include the fantastic and the individual's experience of it. He also argues that the artistic merit of a work is more important than its political usefulness.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage discusses three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time. The first direction maintained that art should stand above the present and the everyday, while the second direction maintained that art had a right to exist only if it was useful and contributed to the creation of a new society. The third position taken by Dostoyevsky is presented in detail and differentiated from the first two positions. The passage explains that Dostoyevsky was a realist who believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but he understood reality in a deeper way than the radical critics who demanded that reality be depicted "as it is". The passage also explains that Dostoyevsky believed that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals, and for Dostoyevsky, artistry was quite simply the ability to write well. Therefore, the third position is differentiated from the first two in detail.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolution and how it can explain altruism in humans.
  The author of passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" and argues that such arguments can be persuasive but needs to be handled with care.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
The author of Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because evolutionary psychologists suggest that genes promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish. This implies that there is an interest (the proliferation of genes) behind the behavior that the agent of the behavior may not even be aware of, which is similar to the idea of a conspiracy theory.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology examines human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A describes how evolutionary psychology seeks to explain human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals.
  Passage A also describes how genes may promote their own self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a kind of conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest (the propagation of genes) to explain behavior that may not be consciously acknowledged by individuals.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains that evolutionary psychology attempts to explain behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior.
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a kind of conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of.
Action: Answer("D")

  The author of Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  The author of Passage B argues that not all of one's motives can be instrumental, and that there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains the evolutionary basis of altruistic behavior and how it could have arisen in response to cues that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" that explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of.
Action: Answer("D") 
The assertion from passage A that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is an example of what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory." It suggests that evolutionary psychology imputes a hidden, self-interested motive (the proliferation of genes) to behavior that appears altruistic.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A explains that evolutionary psychology seeks to explain human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint.
  The problem of altruism arises because it is difficult to explain how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior.
  The answer to this problem may lie in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy, which could have initially arisen in response to cues that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors.
  Genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology examines human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution, and how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A explores the evolution of behavior from an evolutionary perspective, seeking to explain how certain behaviors contribute to the proliferation of genetic material.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

Action: Answer("C")  
The main point of the passage is to argue that Schoenberg's music, although challenging and controversial, is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations. The passage highlights the evolution of Schoenberg's musical style and the three different musical styles through which it evolved. It emphasizes the technical mastery and emotional depth of Schoenberg's work and argues that his music is essential because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. The passage also notes that his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow as his career progressed. The passage does not suggest that Schoenberg's music is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent (A), that he deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven (B), that he is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique (D), or that he has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven (E).

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives
  E: eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise
  C: concerned that research results supporting it may omit crucial anecdotal evidence indicating pitfalls in its use
  D: approving of its use on the grounds that its success is experimentally supported and can be psychologically explained
  E: skeptical of its suitability for use by lawyers without lengthy experience in courtroom strategies

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain
  C: an editorial in a contemporary newspaper from the Lower Rio Grande Border

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues for the reliability of fingerprint identification as a form of evidence, citing the consistency of the "points and characteristics" approach and the establishment of uniform standards through professional training and peer review. It argues that while further testing and development of standards may be desirable, there is no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and has withstood the test of time. 
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and that there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. It argues that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, with one rigorous test showing a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The defendant in the criminal appeal challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often fingerprint examiners incorrectly identify a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. The author of Passage A sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The author of Passage B argues that Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.

Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and has long been regarded as reliable, and that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification, with uniform standards established through professional training and peer review. The court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time, but acknowledges that further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match," there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, and the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. It is unknown how likely it is that two people could have a given number of identifying characteristics in common, and the odds that two partial prints from different people will match are also unknown.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the similarities between the art of painting and the art of perfume-making.
  The author argues that perfumes are undervalued and that large corporations often compromise their quality for profit.
  The passage does not make any explicit statements about the superiority of one form of art over another.
  The passage does suggest that a work of art can evoke memories and bring about an aesthetic experience.
  The passage also discusses the careful formulation of both oil paintings and perfumes to create a harmonious combination of elements.
  There is no evidence in the passage to support the idea that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  The passage does suggest that fine perfume is ill-served by marketing and public relations, but it does not make any explicit statements about the quality of art improving with age.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume-making as forms of art.
  It suggests that perfumers and painters both combine natural and synthetic elements to create something that stimulates the senses.
  The passage also suggests that the quality of perfumes has declined due to the influence of large corporations.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
The passage provides the most support for statement A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes. The passage compares the work of perfumers and painters, noting that both can create something that evokes memories or experiences in the viewer or wearer. The passage suggests that perfumers are "in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas." Therefore, the passage supports the idea that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfumery, and the undervaluation of great perfume due to the involvement of large corporations that tamper with the original formulas to save money. 
  A: The passage mentions that perfumes can evoke memories, but it does not make a general statement about all works of art.
  B: The passage discusses how perfumers experiment with olfactory elements and produce many small sensations in symphonic combination. However, it does not make a general statement about all works of art.
  C: The passage does not suggest that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success. It simply discusses how commercial interests have affected the world of fine perfume.
  D: The passage mentions that oil paintings change over time and become more transparent, but it does not make a general statement about all works of art improving with age.
  E: The passage does not make a statement about the superiority of one form of art over another. It simply discusses the undervaluation of great perfume. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the similarities between the creation of oil paintings and the creation of perfumes.
  The passage argues that the art of perfume is undervalued because it is controlled by large corporations that prioritize profits over quality.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The passage provides the most support for statement A: "A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes." The author compares the work of a perfumer to that of a painter or composer, suggesting that all three can create an imaginary world that evokes memories and emotions. The author also suggests that a great perfume can create an intimate and powerful experience.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between the art of painting and the art of perfumery.
  It highlights the complex configurations of olfactory elements and the symphonic combination of small sensations that talented "noses" experiment with to produce great perfumes.
  It also mentions that truly great smells are undervalued in today's world due to the substitution of cheap chemical compounds in perfume formulas.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: The passage provides more support for choice A, which states that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes. The author compares the work of a perfumer to that of an artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas, and notes that both can evoke memories and experiences in the audience. The passage does not provide strong support for the other choices.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between oil painting and the art of perfumery, and argues that great perfume is not taken seriously enough. 
  A: The passage briefly mentions that perfumers "call on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience," but this is not the primary focus of the passage.
  B: The passage suggests that perfumers experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, which can change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, similar to the way that painters combine natural and synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins. This statement is supported by the passage.
  C: The passage suggests that the cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. This suggests that commercial success can interfere with the creation of fine perfume, but the passage does not suggest that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The passage suggests that the appearance of an oil painting changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent, but it does not suggest that the best works of art improve with age.
  E: The passage does not suggest that some forms of art are superior to others. It suggests that perfumery is not taken as seriously as other forms of art, despite the parallels between the two. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage compares the art of painting with the art of perfume making. It also discusses how perfumes are undervalued and changed by large corporations.
  A: The passage does mention that perfumes can bring back memories, but it does not discuss this as a general statement about art.
  B: The passage discusses how the combinations of olfactory elements in perfumes can produce many small sensations, but it does not mention this as a general statement about all art.
  C: The passage discusses how the quality of perfumes has declined due to the influence of large corporations, but it does not suggest that creating art for commercial success always leads to failure.
  D: The passage does not discuss whether the best works of art improve with age.
  E: The passage does not make a comparison between different forms of art to determine superiority.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the similarities between the art of painting and the art of perfumery.
  The passage argues that great perfume is undervalued, partly because it is made and distributed by large corporations that substitute cheaper ingredients for more expensive ones.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The passage provides the most support for the statement that "A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes." This idea is expressed in the passage when it discusses how talented perfumers can "call[] on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience," and how the artist who creates a painting can "create the illusion of life on canvas."
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses the parallels between the art of painting and the art of perfumery, noting that both require the skilled combination of various elements to create a sensory experience. The passage also notes that the commercialization of perfume has led to the substitution of cheaper ingredients, potentially compromising the quality of the final product.

Analysis:
Option A is mentioned in the passage as a reason why perfumes should be taken seriously as works of art, but it is not the main point of the passage.
Option B is mentioned in the passage as a parallel between the arts of painting and perfumery, but it is not the main point of the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.

Explanation: The passage discusses the discovery of prions as a new type of protein pathogen that can reproduce itself without genetic material, and their link to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens that are unique in their ability to reproduce themselves without the use of genetic material. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The other answer choices either focus on minor details or do not accurately capture the main point of the passage.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a new, deadly class of protein pathogens called prions, which are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. The passage discusses in detail the discovery of prions, their properties, and their role in causing CJD, as well as the implications of this discovery for our understanding of infectious diseases. While the passage also mentions other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, it does not suggest that prions are responsible for these conditions. Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not focus on the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules reproduce themselves, but rather on the discovery of prions and their role in causing disease. Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the scientific community has rejected the idea that prions cause CJD, but rather that this idea was initially met with skepticism. Choice E is partially correct, but does not fully capture the significance of the discovery of prions and their role in causing CJD.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen, and their role in causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Prions lack nucleic acid, reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, and cause cellular destruction in the brain leading to CJD. The discovery of prions challenged the assumption that all pathogens contain genetic material in their cellular structure, and it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions.
  
A: This choice is discussing the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules reproduce themselves but does not specifically address prions or their role in CJD.
B: This choice accurately describes the main point of the passage, as it highlights the discovery of a new class of protein pathogens capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material and their role in causing CJD.
C: While the passage mentions the possibility that prions may be responsible for other degenerative neurological conditions, it does not state that they are responsible for most other such conditions, and this choice overstates the extent of the evidence presented in the passage.

However, the central focus of the passage is on the discovery of prions and their unique ability to reproduce themselves without genetic material, making choice B the best answer.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

The main point of the passage is to describe the discovery of prions as a new class of infectious pathogens that are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material, causing diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Therefore, the most accurate choice is B: "Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material."
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has led to the discovery of a new class of protein pathogens called prions that are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. This is best expressed in choice B. While the passage discusses other topics, such as the symptoms of CJD and the possibility that prions may be involved in other neurological conditions, these are secondary to the main point about prions as a new type of pathogen. Choices A and E are partially correct but miss the central importance of prions to the passage. Choice C goes beyond the evidence presented in the passage and is not supported by the text. Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not say that the scientific community was skeptical of the idea that prions cause CJD because it challenged a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. This is expressed in the passage in several places, including the introduction of prions as a new type of protein pathogen that lacks nucleic acid, the description of how prions reproduce themselves by inducing normal prions to transform into abnormal, pathogenic conformation, and the discussion of how prion-related mechanisms may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use
  D: detectable using brain scans enhanced by means of the subtractive method
  E: features of a general mental activity that is spread throughout the brain

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

E: This choice refers to an obstacle to understanding the evidence, rather than the evidence itself. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the discovery and recognition of nuclear fission, which was achieved by splitting uranium atoms through neutron bombardment experiments.
  In 1939, Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that helped scientists recognize that they had achieved nuclear fission.
  The researchers had been compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  In 1938, Meitner discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Late in 1938, Otto Hahn wrote to Meitner about a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and how scientists failed to recognize the evidence they had been compiling for years. Lise Meitner was the one who recognized that uranium atoms had been split, and she coined the term "nuclear fission."
 
Analysis: In the passage, "the relevant evidence" (line 62) refers to the evidence that scientists had been compiling for years that they failed to recognize as showing they had actually been splitting uranium atoms.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The article talks about the discovery of nuclear fission, which was achieved by splitting the nuclei of atoms.
  The physicists had been conducting experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium between 1934 and 1939, and had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939, recognizing that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  Hahn's clear chemical evidence that barium was produced by neutron bombardment of uranium had gone "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Roy Lichtenstein's work as a merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art that conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. His work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation: None of the options directly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein except option D, which suggests that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, which would conflict with the author's description of Lichtenstein's work as having a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody and an impulse toward realism and true feeling. Therefore, option D is the best answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses how Roy Lichtenstein's work helped define the pop art movement by merging the style of comic books with the forms and intentions of fine art. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. Lichtenstein's work was characterized by a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists. 

Action: Answer("D") 
Choice D would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein because it contradicts the passage's claim that Lichtenstein's work was characterized by a deliberate naivete and a faith in reconciliation. If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, it suggests that he valued emotional restraint in art and may have been less interested in reconciliation than the passage suggests.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a complex result of merging a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, capable of conveying a seriousness of theme that enables it to transcend mere parody. Lichtenstein's images were fine art, but at first, it was difficult to see because they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. The author notes that Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. 
  A: Lichtenstein attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  B: Lichtenstein praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  C: Lichtenstein praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  D: Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  E: Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art that generated a complex result. Lichtenstein's work poked fun at the pretensions of the art world while conveying a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody.

His work displayed an impulse toward realism and depicted contemporary life. Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete. 
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The passage describes Lichtenstein's work as emanating a deliberate naivete not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture. Therefore, Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings does not conflict with the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. Options A, B, and C are all related to Lichtenstein's appreciation or criticism of abstract expressionist painters, which is not relevant to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as pop art. Option E is also not related to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art that generated a complex result. It conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. Lichtenstein's images were fine art, not just comic book panels that they looked like.

Analysis:
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. The answer choice that challenges the author's characterization would contradict one or more of the characterizations given by the author.

A: If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, it does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. It is possible that Lichtenstein attended these exhibitions to learn from other artists and to stay up to date with the art world. This answer choice is not directly related to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

B: If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting, it does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. This could simply be Lichtenstein's personal opinion and does not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.

C: If Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, it does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. This could simply be Lichtenstein's personal opinion and does not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.

D: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, it does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the emergence of pop art as a response to the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, and Lichtenstein's work as part of a general rebellion against this trend.
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, which generated a complex result that conveyed a seriousness of theme and transcended mere parody. The passage states that Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The passage also notes that Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, it would support the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as a deliberate departure from the emotional excess of abstract expressionism and some other pop artists. Therefore, answer choice D would not challenge the author's characterization. Answer choices A, B, C, and E are all irrelevant to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work, and therefore do not provide a challenge.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes Roy Lichtenstein as a painter who helped define pop art by parodying the style of comic books and merging popular genres with fine art. 
  The passage also states that Lichtenstein's work conveyed a seriousness of theme and realism, despite being based on comic books. 
  The passage notes that Lichtenstein's work was part of a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, and that his persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrated a faith in reconciliation between cartoons and fine art. 
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Choice D, "Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings," would challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as a painter who conveyed a seriousness of theme and realism, despite being based on comic books. If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist for producing emotional paintings, it would suggest that he did not value emotional content in art and was not interested in conveying serious themes through his own work. This would contradict the author's portrayal of Lichtenstein as a painter who used comic-book style to critique the pretensions of the art world while also conveying a seriousness of theme.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider trading law should allow people to act on accurate information about changing circumstances to help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts, and that insider nontrading happens every day and should not be criminalized.
  Passage B argues that the stock market should be transparent, and that insider trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Passage A argues that insider trading helps ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts, and that insider nontrading is a far more widespread practice that is rightfully so.
  - Passage B argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market. It also emphasizes the importance of transparency in the stock market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone because it helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts and that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading laws should prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone because it unfairly compromises the market, causing a loss of investor confidence and ultimately leading to widespread financial repercussions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws are not necessary and can harm the stock market because they prevent accurate information from being spread to all investors.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading laws are necessary to ensure a transparent market where everyone has the same chance to make good investment decisions.
  
Analysis:
  Passage A argues against the need for insider-trading laws, but supports a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory and how increasing returns to scale create a natural monopoly, which contradicts the idea of the Invisible Hand. The passage explains that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, but recent developments in mathematics enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled rigorously enough to make it respectable. Therefore, the correct answer is E, which states that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and how the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. It explains that the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. Until the late 1970s, economists failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries, such as railroads, because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Hence, the correct answer is E.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand and how it creates problems for economic theory. The Pin Factory represents the concept of increasing returns to scale and tends to lead to monopoly, while the Invisible Hand assumes diminishing returns and relies on many competitors in each industry. The passage explains how economists have historically struggled to incorporate increasing returns into economic theory due to difficulty in representing it mathematically. Only recently have economists found ways to describe increasing returns with the rigor needed to make it respectable. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Thus, the correct answer is E.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction and struggle between two economic concepts, the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and how they are opposed to each other. The Pin Factory illustrates increasing returns to scale that create a natural tendency towards monopoly, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry so that nobody can exert monopoly power. The passage also explains why the economics of diminishing returns was preferred over those of increasing returns for almost two centuries. Finally, the passage notes that only since the late 1970s has the Pin Factory surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the correct answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction between two concepts in economic theory, the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and how they are opposed to each other. The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increasing returns to scale while the Invisible Hand relies on the assumption of diminishing returns to scale. The passage explains how the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, but increasing returns are common in many industries. It also explains why it was challenging to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought. The passage concludes by stating that only since the late 1970s have economists found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable. Therefore, the most accurate main point of the passage is that economists have, until recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Hence, the correct answer is E.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

The main point of the passage is that for almost two centuries, economists have assumed that returns to scale were diminishing, not increasing, although increasing returns characterized many enterprises such as railroads, and the Pin Factory. The idea of free markets always getting it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing, but increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which can be an obstacle to the proper functioning of the invisible hand. The reason why the Pin Factory was not included in economic theory was that it was notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, answer E is the correct choice.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the inherent contradiction between increasing returns to scale and the idea of a competitive market economy, which relies on many players in each industry to prevent monopoly power. The passage argues that for almost two centuries, economists assumed that returns to scale were diminishing, which allowed them to model economic concepts with mathematical rigor. However, this assumption did not account for the increasing returns to scale that characterize many industries, and the Pin Factory model struggled to be incorporated into economic theory until recent developments in mathematics enabled it to be modeled more rigorously. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Answer choice E accurately expresses this main point.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction between Adam Smith's idea of the "invisible hand" and the "pin factory" which emphasized the increasing returns to scale. The "invisible hand" assumes that there are many competitors in each industry so that no one can exert monopoly power. However, the increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, and hence there is a contradiction between the two concepts. The passage explains why for almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory. It was only since the late 1970s that increasing returns to scale have surfaced in the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the correct answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes the historical struggle within economic theory between the concepts of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The Pin Factory emphasizes increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand assumes diminishing returns. The passage explains that for the Invisible Hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. However, increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. The passage goes on to explain that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, but that economists have only recently begun to account for increasing returns to scale. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory since the publication of Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations in 1776. The Pin Factory describes the increasing returns to scale that come from specialization, while the Invisible Hand suggests that a market economy can harness self-interest for the common good. However, these two concepts are opposed to each other, as increasing returns tend to drive smaller firms out of business, leading to a natural tendency toward monopoly. For the Invisible Hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry. Until recently, economists have failed to account for the increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries. Only since the late 1970s have economists found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Answer("E").

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading can help spread accurate information and improve stock prices and that insider nontrading is a widespread practice that is not penalized.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence in the stock market and that transparency is a key principle of a functioning stock market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions based on information not available to the general public.
  Stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely and quickly as possible.
  Transparent stock markets allow everyone to have the same chance of making a good investment.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  Passage A acknowledges that stock markets work best when everyone has access to the same information, but argues that insider nontrading is a far more widespread practice and that insider trading can actually help spread accurate information about a company's value. Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence, compromises the market, and denies companies the funds they need to grow and be successful. Therefore, the authors of both passages would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws can impede the efficient functioning of the stock market by preventing insiders from acting on information that others do not have, while also acknowledging that the widespread practice of "insider nontrading" is not a criminal offense. 
  Passage B argues that the transparency of the stock market is a key principle that ensures all participants have the same chance of making good investment decisions, and that insider trading undermines this principle and can lead to a loss of investor confidence that could harm the market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that some types of insider trading are good for the market, but there is a need to distinguish between good and bad insider trading. It is implied that insider trading that involves trading on information that is not available to the wider public, and which can harm the market, is bad insider trading.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the stock market and the confidence of investors. It suggests that all market participants should have access to the same information to ensure that the market is fair and transparent.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques from certain cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance.
  The passage also discusses how Dunham's approach to research diverged from prevailing methodology in anthropology, which advised detachment from the subject being studied.
  The passage suggests that Dunham's immersion in the dances she was studying, by participating in them herself, was critical to her success in understanding and teaching those dances.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The statement that "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them" is most consistent with the view of Dunham's peers, as described in the passage. The passage states that "most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry" (lines 5-7), and that "experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research" (lines 12-13). These statements suggest that Dunham's peers would have been more likely to value scientific rigor over expertise in dance traditions, and would have believed that it was possible to conduct research on dance without being well versed in those traditions.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as a field of study in anthropology due to the lack of experts in dance who were trained in social research methods, and vice versa.
  The passage also describes Dunham's success in studying and incorporating traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern North American dance by immersing herself in the dances and participating in them.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with choice B, which states that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. This is because the passage explains that previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists were not trained in dance and no experts in dance were trained in social research methods. This suggests that the "peers" may have believed that it was not necessary for social scientists to be well versed in dance, and that they could still obtain reliable data about it. However, the passage goes on to explain that Dunham's approach to research involved participating in the dances herself and immersing herself in the cultures, which allowed her to comprehend the dances as complex cultural practices and learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. This suggests that the "peers" may have been mistaken in their belief that social scientists need not be well versed in dance to obtain reliable data about it.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about dance ethnology as a field of research that was neglected in the past because most social scientists were not trained in dance techniques and most experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Katherine Dunham was able to bridge this gap by using a research-to-performance method that allowed her to adapt traditional Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance. 
  A: The passage does not suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: The passage does not suggest that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: The passage suggests that traditional methods of data collection were inadequate for studying dance as a cultural form, but it also suggests that Katherine Dunham's approach to research was effective. 
  D: The passage does not suggest that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: The passage does not suggest that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Action: Answer("C")

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research in the past.
  The prevailing view at the time was that effective data gathering can only be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. She participated in the dances herself, which allowed her to comprehend the dances as complex cultural practices and learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
Action: Answer("B")  
The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. However, this view is no longer considered accurate, as Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research in the past and the lack of training among social scientists to understand dance techniques. Katherine Dunham's success in bringing dance techniques from other cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance was largely due to her training in both anthropological research and choreography. Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. She was able to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, and learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
Action: Answer("B") 
The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. The passage states that most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.

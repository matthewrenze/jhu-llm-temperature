Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passages A and B discuss wealth, happiness, and the importance of relative income.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study found that people often prefer to be relatively better off than their peers, even if it means an absolute decrease in income.
  Passage B argues that people want to earn more money not just to show off their wealth, but also to create value and feel successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The two passages discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness, and how people's perception of wealth and success influences their happiness. Passage A discusses how people compare their income to a social norm and how the phenomenon of rivalry affects happiness. Passage B argues that people who earn more feel more successful, and that this feeling of success, not the money per se, provides happiness. 
  A: Insular means isolated and narrow-minded, while cosmopolitan means open-minded and worldly. Neither term accurately describes a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors. 
  B: Altruistic means unselfish and concerned with the welfare of others, while egocentric means self-centered and selfish. Neither term accurately describes a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  C: The terms happy and miserable describe the emotional state of a person, not the motivation behind their desire to make more money than their neighbors.
  D: Misguided means mistaken or ill-informed, while admirable means worthy of admiration. Neither term accurately describes a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  E: Lucky means fortunate, while primitive means ancient or basic. Neither term accurately describes a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and B discuss the relationship between wealth, happiness and the importance of relative prosperity in determining people's happiness. 
  Passage B argues that the desire for relative prosperity stems from a desire to create value, which is an admirable trait, while it is not the case for passage A.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness and how people compare themselves with their reference group to determine their happiness. 
  The authors of Passage B argue that people want to create value by earning more and that this desire is not ignoble, but rather beneficial for society.
  Neither Passage A nor Passage B suggests that a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is altruistic or egocentric.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how people compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. The phenomenon of rivalry is discussed in detail, where people prefer to be poorer, provided their relative position improved.
  Passage B refutes the idea that we care most about one-upmanship and explains that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. 
Action: Answer("D")  
Reasoning: 
  Passage A presents the idea that people compare their income with some norm and discusses the phenomena of habituation and rivalry. It notes that people overinvest in acquiring material possessions, at the expense of leisure. The concept of rivalry is discussed in detail, where people prefer to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. Passage B refutes the idea of one-upmanship and explains that earning more makes people feel that they are successful and that they have created value. It argues that wanting to create value benefits society. Therefore, the authors of passage A might describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "misguided" since it points out that people overinvest in acquiring material possessions. The authors of passage B might describe such a person as "admirable" since it argues that wanting to create value benefits society. Therefore, the best answer is D.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss the relationship between money, happiness, and social comparison. 
  Passage A discusses how people compare their income with some norm and that norm must be rising along with actual income. It also explains the phenomenon of rivalry, where people choose to earn less money if they can improve their relative position compared to others. 
  Passage B argues that people want to create value and demonstrate their success through material wealth. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness, and the role of relative prosperity in determining happiness. 
  There is no indication in either passage that the authors would use terms such as insular or cosmopolitan to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study discussed in Passage A suggests that people are motivated to improve their relative position rather than simply accumulate more wealth.
  The authors of Passage B argue that the desire to create value motivates people to earn more money.
Action: Answer ("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B describe the relationship between happiness and wealth.
  Passage A explains how people compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. This creates a phenomenon called rivalry where people want to be richer than their neighbors. 
  Passage B explains that wanting to make more money than his or her neighbors is not an ignoble tendency, but is really evidence of a desire to create value.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research and theories about the relationship between material wealth and happiness. They suggest that people compare their income and prosperity with some norm, and that relative prosperity makes them feel successful and happy. They also argue that wanting to create value and to be successful benefits society and brings happiness. However, they do not use any pair of terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: The information in the passage most helps to answer a which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: What laboratory experiments were conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs?
  B: What was the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1 987?
  C: In what year did Molina testify before the U.S. Congress?
  D: Does .any chemical that does not contain chlorine contribute to the destruction of ozone molecules?
  E: Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses the research and advocacy of Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland on the depletion of the ozone layer and the role of CFCs in this process. They showed how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Chlorine is one of the constituent elements of CFCs and is particularly damaging to the ozone layer, as it reacts with ozone in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.

A: The passage does mention that Molina and Rowland studied two freon gases (types of CFCs) and observed how they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation. However, the passage does not provide information about specific laboratory experiments conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs. Therefore, this question is not answered by the passage.
B: The passage does mention that in 1974, Molina and Rowland estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. However, the passage does not provide information about the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1987. Therefore, this question is not answered by the passage.
C: The passage does mention that Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. However, the passage does not provide information about the specific year in which Molina testified before the U.S. Congress. Therefore, this question is not answered by the passage.
D: The passage does not discuss any chemical other than CFCs and their constituent elements in relation to the destruction of ozone molecules. Therefore, this question is not answered by the passage.
E: The passage states that chlorine is one of the constituent elements of CFCs and is particularly damaging to the ozone layer, as it reacts with ozone in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. Therefore, the information in the passage most helps to answer the question of which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the chemical composition of plants and the role of secondary substances, which give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Some secondary substances serve as defense mechanisms against insects, either as poison or through warning smells/tastes. Insects evolve to circumvent these defenses by detoxifying harmful substances, storing them in their bodies, or simply avoiding them. Insects come to prefer plants whose defenses they can circumvent, leading to a narrowing of suitable food sources.
A: The passage indeed provides evidence that secondary substances, which are not involved in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, play important roles in many different kinds of plants.
B: The passage provides evidence that many species of insects have evolved ways to circumvent the defenses of plants that have chemical defense systems. However, the passage does not provide evidence that most plants with chemical defense systems are used as food by a wide variety of insects.
C: The passage does not suggest that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell. In fact, the passage suggests that insects use characteristic flavors and odors to identify plants whose defenses they can circumvent.
D: The passage suggests that many secondary substances that are toxic to insects arose independently through genetic mutations in individual plants and were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be effective biochemical defenses against insects. However, the passage does not suggest that scientists believe these substances evolved in unrelated species of plants and survived in only a few species.

Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how the characteristic smells and tastes of plants are attributed to secondary substances that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of the plants' growth or metabolism. These secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. These secondary substances arise in plants due to genetic mutations and are favored by natural selection only if they increase the likelihood of the plant's survival and reproduction. Insects play a major role in many plants having secondary substances. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects to blossoms, while others arose as biochemical defenses against insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die, while others are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. A competition has been going on for hundreds of millions of years between plants and plant-eating insects, in which fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect.
  
A: The passage mentions that secondary substances in plants have no known role in internal chemical processes of plant growth or metabolism, and are diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. These secondary substances play a vital role in the lives of various kinds of plants, so this option is supported by the passage.
B: The passage mentions that some defensive substances that plants produce cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die, and others are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding. Although plants have evolved various defense systems to protect themselves from insects, the passage does not suggest that most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses. This option is not supported by the passage.
C: The passage suggests that insects have evolved ways of circumventing plants' defenses and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors or both. This option is not supported by the passage because it suggests that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell which is not mentioned in the passage.
D: The passage mentions that only a few of the secondary substances that arise by mutation in individual plants are conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. The passage does not mention that many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species. This option is not supported by the passage.
E: The passage mentions that some secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species. This option is supported by the passage.
 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and how they evolve secondary substances.
  The secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plant growth or metabolism, but they give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Natural selection favors secondary substances that attract pollinating insects and biochemical defenses against plant enemies, which are mostly insects.
  Insects that survive as plants develop defenses against them switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent plant defenses.
  The competition between plants and plant-eating insects has led to the association of species of insects with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
  
A: The passage does provide support for this inference, but it is not the most fitting answer. The passage states that secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plant growth or metabolism, but they give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms, and others were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, which are mostly insects.
B: The passage provides support for this inference. It discusses how insects that survive as plants develop defenses against them switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent plant defenses. Insects come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both.
C: The passage does not provide support for this inference. The passage states that species of insects have tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants. It also discusses how insects eventually evolve the ability to identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both.
D: The passage provides support for this inference. It states that some secondary substances have arisen by mutation and were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, which are mostly insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die.
E: The passage mentions that some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances. However, this is a minor point that is not the focus of the passage and does not provide the most support for this inference.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and the role of primary and secondary substances. 
  It describes how secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and how they can act as defenses against plant-eating insects.
  The passage also discusses the evolutionary competition between plants and insects and how insects have evolved ways to circumvent plant defenses.
A: The passage discusses the role of secondary substances, which are not involved in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, but may play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants. However, it does not support the inference that some of these chemicals are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant.
B: The passage provides support for the inference that most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses. 
C: The passage implies that insects are able to identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both, and that many insects are associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants. However, it does not support the inference that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
D: The passage provides support for the inference that many secondary substances that are toxic to insects have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but have survived in only a few species.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as the phenomenon where a larger business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business, which creates a natural tendency toward monopoly since bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business. 
  A: This choice involves reducing the number of editors, which is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This choice involves specialization of bees, but it is not a business-related activity that involves increasing returns to scale.
  C: This choice involves increasing the utilization of a building but it does not involve increasing returns to scale.
  D: This choice involves the lobster industry being able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps, which is due to advances in technology and is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  E: This choice involves the growth of ant colonies, but it is not a business-related activity that involves increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that a larger scale of production leads to lower costs per unit of output, and therefore higher efficiency and productivity. The passage explains that the Pin Factory is an example of increasing returns to scale because the employees' specialization on narrow tasks leads to far more productivity than they could achieve if each worked independently, allowing the factory to produce more pins per worker. 

A: This option does not illustrate increasing returns to scale because it describes the production of the same amount of output (books) with fewer resources (editors). 
B: This option does not illustrate increasing returns to scale because it describes how a larger bee colony can collect more nectar, but it does not describe how the costs per unit of output decrease with scale. 
C: This option does not illustrate increasing returns to scale because it describes an increase in the total number of students accommodated, but it does not describe how the costs per unit of output decrease with scale. 
D: This option does not illustrate increasing returns to scale because the lobster industry is able to catch substantially more lobsters per day due to advances in technology, but not because of its increasing scale of production. 
E: This option illustrates increasing returns to scale because a larger number of colonies leads to more productivity - in this case, a larger number of ants. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph. The author uses the example of a pin factory to illustrate how larger firms can achieve larger scale and lower costs due to specialization, leading to natural tendencies toward monopoly if returns to scale are increasing. The author notes that the idea of free markets always getting it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. 
  A: This choice does not best illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This choice does not best illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: This choice does not best illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D: This choice does not best illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  E: This choice best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale, where a large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The second paragraph of the passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  A: This answer choice does not involve any increase in scale.
  B: This answer choice involves an increase in scale due to the ability to divide labor and specialization.
  C: This answer choice involves an increase in capacity, but not necessarily an increase in efficiency or productivity.
  D: This answer choice involves an increase in productivity due to the use of improved technology.
  E: This answer choice involves an increase in scale due to the ability to divide labor and specialization.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that as a firm or industry gets larger, the amount it produces per worker or per unit of capital increases. Increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players.
A: This answer describes a case in which the number of editors is decreased, which is a decreasing return to scale, not an increasing one.
B: This answer describes a case where some bees are assigned to guard the nectar sources, which is not related to a firm or industry getting larger and experiencing increasing returns to scale.
C: This answer describes a case where a school district increases total enrollment by utilizing its existing resources more efficiently, which is not related to a firm or industry getting larger and experiencing increasing returns to scale.
D: This answer describes a case where technology advances make the process of catching lobsters easier, resulting in higher output per unit of capital. This is an example of increasing returns to scale.
E: This answer describes a situation where an ant colony divides to form new colonies, which is not related to a firm or industry getting larger and experiencing increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: Increasing returns to scale describes the phenomenon whereby the bigger the firm, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output the firm can produce per worker. This creates a natural tendency toward monopoly. The Pin Factory is an example of this phenomenon. 
A: This answer choice discusses a firm being able to increase in productivity by relaxing editing standards. It does not relate to increasing returns to scale.
B: This answer choice discusses how a large bee colony is able to collect more nectar and that in turn can feed a larger colony. Although this example mentions a colony becoming larger, it does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
C: This answer choice refers to a school district's ability to increase the total number of students accommodated in a single building through year-round operation. While this may be an example of increasing efficiency, it does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
D: This answer choice discusses the lobster industry's ability to catch more lobsters per day due to advances in technology. It does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
E: This answer choice discusses how a large ant colony can divide and produce more colonies. This example is an instance of increasing returns to scale because the larger the ant colony, the more it can specialize and produce more ants per worker. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The question asks for the example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale. According to the passage, increasing returns to scale means that the bigger a business or enterprise, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output it can produce per worker. Increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. In contrast, diminishing returns to scale means that the more a business expands, the more expensive it becomes to expand, and so the higher its average costs become.
  
  A: This example talks about reducing the number of editors to improve productivity, so it is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This example talks about how a large colony can better divide labor to collect more nectar, but it is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale as it does not involve the expansion of a business or enterprise.
  C: This example talks about increasing the number of students in a single building, but it is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale as it doesn't describe how the size of a business or enterprise leads to more efficient production.
  D: This example talks about how the lobster industry can catch more lobsters due to advances in technology. This example is not directly related to the concept of increasing returns to scale as it does not describe how the size of the industry leads to more efficient production. 
  E: This example talks about the division of a large ant colony into competing colonies that grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. This example best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale as it describes how the size of the colony leads to more efficient production. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as a concept where larger scale organizations have lower costs per unit of production and can produce more output per worker than smaller scale organizations.
  A: This answer choice describes a reduction of input (fewer editors) rather than an increase in output.
  B: This answer choice describes a better division of labor, but it does not describe a situation where a larger scale organization has lower costs per unit of production or produces more output per worker than smaller scale organizations.
  C: This answer choice describes a better use of time and resources, but it does not describe a situation where a larger scale organization has lower costs per unit of production or produces more output per worker than smaller scale organizations.
  D: This answer choice describes a scenario where technology results in more output per worker, which is similar to the concept of increasing returns to scale. However, this answer choice describes a technological innovation that benefits all organizations in the industry, regardless of size, rather than a scenario where larger scale organizations have lower costs per unit of production than smaller scale organizations.
  E: This answer choice describes a scenario where dividing a colony results in more output than having one large colony. However, this scenario does not describe the concept of increasing returns to scale in which larger scale organizations have lower costs per unit of production than smaller scale organizations.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Increasing returns to scale describe a situation where a business can produce more output per worker by increasing the size of the firm and having workers specialize in narrow tasks.
  A: This describes a situation where a business is able to produce more output by reducing standards for editors, which doesn't fit the description of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This describes a situation where a bee colony is able to use some bees solely for protection and others for collecting nectar, allowing for more nectar to be collected and a larger colony to exist, which does fit the description of increasing returns to scale.
  C: This describes a situation where a school district is able to increase the total number of students accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, which doesn't fit the description of increasing returns to scale.
  D: This describes a situation where advances in technology makes lobster traps easier for lobsters to get through, allowing the lobster industry to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps, which doesn't fit the description of increasing returns to scale.
  E: This describes a situation where a large ant colony splits into two competing colonies which each grow and eventually split again, resulting in more ants than could have existed in one colony, which doesn't fit the description of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale as the idea that larger firms can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller firms.
  A: This answer choice describes a decrease in productivity, not an increase, and does not relate to the concept of returns to scale.
  B: This answer choice describes a natural division of labor within a bee colony, but does not relate to the concept of returns to scale.
  C: This answer choice describes an increase in efficiency, but does not relate to the concept of returns to scale.
  D: This answer choice describes an increase in productivity through technological advancements, and is therefore the best illustration of increasing returns to scale.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.

Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.
  E: Katherine Dunham's anthropological and choreographic expertise enabled her to make contributions that altered the landscape of modern dance in North America.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz as an example of a novel that uses the structuring principle of jazz music in its narration.
  A: This choice is too extreme. The passage discusses how Morrison's novel reflects the style of jazz, but it does not specifically state that she intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance.
  B: The passage does not mention any examples of African American novelists who structured their work based on the typical structure of blues music. Additionally, the question is asking about African American writers who have used music as the structuring principle for an entire novel, not just the form of their work.
  C: The passage does not make a blanket statement about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists. The passage is specifically discussing Jazz and how it uses the structuring principle of jazz music in its narration.
  D: The passage discusses how Jazz uses the structure of jazz music in its narration, but it does not make a claim that all novels can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: This choice is irrelevant to the question. While the passage does mention that many African American writers have used music as a theme or metaphor in their writing, the question is specifically asking about writers who have used music as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses how Toni Morrison used a musical genre, jazz, as the structuring principle for her novel Jazz.
  The author also discusses how the narration in Jazz shifts between third-person and first-person perspectives, similar to how a jazz ensemble blends individual solos with the ensemble sound.
  The author asserts that this structure creates "the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author is discussing Toni Morrison's novel "Jazz" and how it is structured like a jazz composition where individual characters have their own unique "voices" in the narrative.
  A: This choice is close to what the passage is saying, but it is not fully accurate as the author is not explicitly stating that the simulation was intentional.
  B: The passage does not mention any African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  C: This choice is too broad and makes a sweeping generalization about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
  D: This choice is also too broad and does not reflect the specific discussion of "Jazz" and its structure.
  E: This choice is outside the scope of the passage and does not relate to the discussion of the structure of "Jazz."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's 1992 novel, Jazz, and its connection to the musical genre of jazz. The narrative structure of Jazz is compared to the playing of jazz music, in which individual musicians improvise within the composer's predetermined framework.
  
  A: This statement is generally true based on the passage but does not affect the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
  
  B: The passage does not mention other African American novelists who have based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, so this statement is not relevant to the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
  
  C: This statement is too broad and general to be relevant to the author's assertion about Jazz's connection to the musical genre of jazz.
  
  D: This statement is too vague and general to be relevant to the author's assertion in lines 11-16, and it is not necessarily true that any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  
  E: This statement is not relevant to the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses Morrison's novel Jazz as a literary rendering of the jazz art of composition in which the structures of the novel's narration emulate that of a jazz ensemble performance. The narration slips between the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice to the first-person lyricism of key characters. The central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak. The author compares the novel's structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances. 

Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
Answer choice A refers to the intentional simulation of the jazz performance style in Jazz, but this is not the assertion made in lines 11-16. Answer choice B describes an earlier attempt by African American novelists to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, but this is irrelevant to the assertion in lines 11-16. Answer choice C is a generalization that is not supported by the passage. Answer choice D is a vague statement that does not relate to the assertion in lines 11-16. Answer choice E is also irrelevant to the assertion in lines 11-16.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is discussing how Toni Morrison uses the structure of jazz music as the structuring principle in her novel Jazz. 
  The author is making a comparison between the structure of the narrative in Jazz and the playing of a jazz band, in which individual musicians improvise within the fixed scope of a composer's composition.
  The author is arguing that Morrison has achieved a unique effect in her novel by simulating the style of a jazz musician while maintaining control over the narrative as a whole.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to jazz music, particularly in the way the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice to the first-person lyricism of key characters, similar to the way jazz music works.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage discusses a debate between two sides of the legal community on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. The debate is whether societal norms or individual choice is the primary factor in committing deliberate crimes. The passage then introduces an economic principle of utility maximization, which holds that given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction. This principle is then used to explain how both sides of the debate are complementary in their approach to deterrence. Therefore, the passage describes two sides of a debate and an economic principle is applied to decide between them. Choice (B) accurately describes the organization of the passage.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage describes a debate between two sides regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, and then introduces an economic principle to reconcile the two positions. The economic principle of utility maximization is used to analyze the rational economic choice of individuals who decide to commit crimes, and it shows that the two deterrence methods are complementary. Therefore, the passage is organized around the two sides of the debate, and the economic principle is applied to decide between them. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage describes two sides of a debate about effective ways to deter crimes, and then introduces an economic principle (utility maximization) to reconcile them. It then explains how the principle applies to the two deterrence methods suggested by the two sides of the debate. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of this passage is that "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them." Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage describes a debate between two sides in the legal community about the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud. One side believes that societal norms and institutions are the root cause of these crimes, and recommends changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing access to economic institutions, and rehabilitating offenders. The other side believes that individual choice is the cause, and recommends increasing fines and penalties and improving law enforcement. The passage then introduces the economic principle of utility maximization, which holds that individuals will choose actions that maximize their overall satisfaction, and applies it to the debate. The principle shows that the two sides are not fundamentally in conflict, and that both approaches have the same overall effect on the expected utility of criminal activity. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage describes a debate between two sides about how to deter deliberate crimes. One side believes that societal norms and institutions drive people to commit crimes, while the other side believes that it is an individual choice. The passage then introduces the economic principle of utility maximization, which explains that individuals will commit crimes if the expected utility of doing so exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. The principle is applied to show that the two sides are not necessarily in conflict and that both of their suggestions can be used effectively to deter crime. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of this passage is that two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
This passage describes a debate about crime deterrence. One side believes that changing societal norms and institutions is the best way to reduce crime, while the other side believes that increasing fines and penalties is more effective. The passage then introduces an economic principle called utility maximization to reconcile the two positions. According to this principle, an individual's decision to commit a crime is a rational economic choice based on the expected utility of the action. The passage argues that both sides of the debate are complementary because both increase the cost of committing a crime and decrease the expected utility of doing so, thereby reducing the likelihood of criminal activity. Therefore, the passage describes two sides of a debate and an economic principle is applied to reconcile them. Hence, the correct answer is B.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B") 
Knowledge:
  The passage describes two sides of a debate about the best method to deter deliberate crimes, one that addresses societal influences and one that emphasizes individual choice.
  Some recent legal scholarship introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, to reconcile the two positions.
  The principle of utility maximization is applied to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
Action: The passage describes two sides of a debate about crime deterrence and applies an economic principle to decide between them. Therefore, the best answer is B: "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them."
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage describes two sides of a debate about crime deterrence (increasing penalties vs. changing societal norms) and introduces an economic principle (utility maximization) that reconciles the two positions by showing that they are complementary. The economic principle is then used to analyze the decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them."
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage describes a debate between two approaches to deter deliberate crimes, and introduces an economic principle to reconcile them. The economic principle is the utility maximization, which holds that people will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction. The principle is used to analyze the decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. The passage shows that the two positions in the debate are not fundamentally in conflict and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that it presents two sides of a debate and applies an economic principle to decide between them. Answer B is the correct answer.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage describes a debate between two sides about the best way to deter deliberate crimes and introduces an economic principle to reconcile these two positions. The economic principle of utility maximization is used to argue that the decision to commit a crime is a rational economic choice and that increasing the expected utility of lawful behavior or decreasing the expected utility of criminal behavior will effectively deter crime. Therefore, the passage is structured around the two sides of the debate and the economic principle that reconciles them. Choice A is incorrect because the principle is used to resolve the conflict, not to describe it. Choice C is incorrect because the principle is not introduced to discredit the two beliefs, but to reconcile them. Choice D is partially correct, but it does not emphasize the debate between the two sides as much as the application of the principle. Choice E is incorrect because the principle is used to reconcile the two sides, not to highlight their differences.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts
  B: to present evidence that undermines a theory
  C: to provide examples that support an argument
  D: to contrast several different modes of expression
  E: to enumerate specific instances in which a phenomenon recurred

Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland showed that manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  - Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms, and each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  - The depletion of the ozone layer would continue even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  - Molina and Rowland's advocacy of dramatic policy changes led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  A: The passage does not support this statement. The passage suggests that natural production and destruction of the ozone gas is in rough equilibrium in the absence of pollutants.
  B: The passage mentions that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer, but it does not suggest that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: The passage does not support this statement. It only mentions that CFCs release chlorine in the atmosphere, but it does not suggest that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: This statement is supported by the passage. The passage suggests that the depletion of the ozone layer leads to an increase in the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface, which contributes to skin cancer. Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs, which deplete the ozone layer, indirectly contributes to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The passage does not support this statement. The passage mentions the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, but it does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) destroy the ozone layer by releasing chlorine into the stratosphere, where it reacts with ozone and destroys it.
  Skin cancer is caused by excessive absorption of ultraviolet light, which is partially blocked by the ozone layer.
  Molina and Rowland's advocacy led to the development of the Montreal Protocol, which banned the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The passage states that skin cancer is caused by excessive absorption of ultraviolet light, which is partially blocked by the ozone layer. The depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs means that more ultraviolet light reaches the Earth's surface, which can increase the incidence of skin cancer. Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. This statement is most strongly supported by the information in the passage.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the impact of manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer. 
  Ultraviolet radiation from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat.
  Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland were two scientists who studied the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer and advocated for policy changes.
  The Montreal Protocol of 1987 was developed to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s, leading to the development of more environmentally friendly chemicals.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The passage discusses how ultraviolet radiation from the sun contributes to skin cancer, and how the depletion of the ozone layer has led to increased exposure to this radiation. The passage also discusses how regulating the use of CFCs has contributed to the reduction of damage to the ozone layer, which in turn helps to reduce the incidence of skin cancer. Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the information in the passage is that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - The passage is about the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer and the efforts of Molina and Rowland to inform public policy.
  - CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  - Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  - Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  - Molina and Rowland's advocacy led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
The passage discusses the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer, which provides a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Excessive absorption of ultraviolet radiation can contribute to skin cancer, but the passage does not suggest that it is the primary cause. The passage does not support choices A, C, or E. The passage does mention the efforts of Molina and Rowland to inform public policy, culminating in the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which banned the production of ozone-depleting gases. The passage suggests that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer, as it helps preserve the ozone layer's effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, Answer("D") is the best answer.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - Ultraviolet radiation contributes to skin cancer.
  - Ozone in the stratosphere screens out much of the sun's damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  - Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  - Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs chemically break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, in the stratosphere.
  - Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  - Molina and Rowland's research led to the development of an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
The passage suggests that the depletion of the ozone layer, caused by CFCs, leads to an increase in the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches the earth's surface. Since ultraviolet radiation contributes to skin cancer, regulating the use of CFCs, as done in the Montreal Protocol of 1987, would contribute indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. None of the other choices are clearly supported by the passage.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Additionally, the passage mentions that chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. The depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat that was recognized by Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, leading to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.

  - Molina and Rowland's research led to the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, which eventually resulted in an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The information in the passage most strongly supports that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. While excessive absorption of ultraviolet light from the sun can result in skin cancer, the passage emphasizes the importance of the ozone layer in screening out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation. The passage also highlights the role of CFCs in chemically attacking and depleting the ozone layer, which led to the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica. The international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases, which was a direct result of Molina and Rowland's research and advocacy, contributed to the restoration of the ozone layer and the reduction of the incidence of skin cancer. Therefore, choice D is the most strongly supported statement.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" (lines 18-19) for which one of the following reasons?
Choices:
  A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics
  B: to illustrate the influence of religion on the historical development of art
  C: to present an example of the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist
  D: to show how an artist can subvert the ideals of the patron
  E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")

The author uses the example of Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to illustrate the sociohistorical interpretation of art favored by critics like Taruskin. The frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, a member of the elite, to express and mirror his ideals and way of life. This example fits with the first way that art was historically "produced by and for political and social elites," which involves a member of the elite engaging a well-known artist to produce something for display. Thus, the answer is A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" to show an example of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The author explains that the frescoes were created to express and mirror the ideals and way of life of the patron, Pope Julius II, rather than to impose the ideals of a governing class or dominant class.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The article states that the second way an art can be "produced by and for political and social elites" was to create a work that expressed and mirrored the patron's ideals and way of life. The frescoes in the Vatican apartments, however, were created by Raphael to embody his ideals, and were commissioned by Pope Julius II. This relationship between artist and patron does not fit the typical pattern discussed in the article. Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The author explains that the second way in which art was produced by and for political and social elites was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments commissioned by Pope Julius II. However, the author goes on to explain that a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings, and some of this art endured. Therefore, the passage shows that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.

Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments were commissioned by Pope Julius II, and thus exemplify the type of art that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to analyze. Thus, the correct answer is A.
Response 5:

However, Raphael's frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, and they expressed and mirrored his ideals and way of life, which suggests a different kind of artist/patron relationship. Therefore, the author presents this example to show that some art can be commissioned by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings, and that such art can go against the grain of elite values and endure despite it.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" (lines 18-19) as an example of an artist/patron relationship that does not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?

Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the history of two theories on how signals are transmitted between neurons.
  The first theory, which postulated that communication between neurons was guided exclusively by electrical signals, believed that electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons).
  The second theory, which is an alternative theory, believed that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron.
  The passage also describes the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions.
  The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions. Attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin.
  The passage concludes by saying that the discovery of the different varieties of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of FMRI for mapping the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain and the differential rate of oxygen use through the subtraction of a baseline measurement from a cognitive task measurement. This results in FMRI images that emphasize functional localization but also obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  A: This choice involves the idea that one particular district voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans as described in the passage.
  B: This choice involves the idea that a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans as described in the passage.
  C: This choice involves the idea that much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans as described in the passage.
  D: This choice involves the idea that Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans as described in the passage.
  E: This choice involves the idea that the cheetah is the world's fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans as described in the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to study mental processes in the brain. 
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain. 
  The method used involves taking a baseline measurement in a control condition and then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. 
  The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. 
  The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. 
  The entire brain is active in both conditions, so the subtractive method obscures the fact that all brain functions are distributed throughout the brain. 
  The modular theory of mind may not be entirely accurate, as mental processes may not be decomposable into independent modules. 

Action: Answer("B") 
The scenario in (B) is most analogous to the FMRI scans' interpretation, as the increase in shoppers during the summer could be attributed solely to the advertising campaign, just as the metabolic activity revealed by FMRI scans is assumed to be associated solely with the cognitive task.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains how brain scans are used in psychology research to investigate the modular theory of mind, which assumes that the mind is composed of distinct modules that are represented by localized brain regions.
  FMRI brain scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which is interpreted as a map of metabolic activity. 
  The FMRI subtractive method subtracts a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement during a cognitive task, so the resulting image depicts the metabolic activity that is associated solely with the cognitive task.
  The subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and creates a false impression of functional localization.

  The passage explains that FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which is a measure of metabolic activity. It also explains that the method used to interpret FMRI scans involves a subtraction of a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
A: This choice involves a particular district contributing to the outcome of an election, which does not relate to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
B: This choice is about a store’s advertising campaign affecting only summer shoppers. It is not analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
C: This choice is about water usage and droughts, which does not relate to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
D: This choice is about Internet traffic from homes and office buildings during peak hours, which does not relate to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
E: This choice is about cheetahs and their running abilities, which does not relate to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  FMRI scans use a subtractive method to reveal areas of the brain that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks. 
  This method subtracts a baseline measurement of brain activity in the control condition from a second measurement while the subject is performing a cognitive task. 
  The resulting differential measurement is assumed to represent the metabolic activity solely associated with the cognitive task in question.
  However, this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and falsely implies a neat functional localization. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that FMRI brain scans involve a subtractive method that creates a false impression of neat functional localization. The baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to show the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain. The entire brain is active in both conditions, but this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active.
A: This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI brain scans, as it does not involve subtracting one measurement from another.
B: This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI brain scans, as it does not involve subtracting one measurement from another.
C: This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI brain scans, as it does not involve subtracting one measurement from another.
D: This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI brain scans, as it does not involve subtracting one measurement from another.
E: This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI brain scans, as it does not involve subtracting one measurement from another.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  This passage describes how FMRI brain scans are interpreted, which is as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. 
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  FMRI scans usually depict the differential rate of oxygen use before and after a cognitive task.
  The subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The modular theory of the mind is illustrated well by the products of the subtractive method.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of interpreting FMRI scans as indicators of localized brain regions responsible for specific mental processes. The FMRI scan produces a differential rate of oxygen use between a control condition and a cognitive task, and the interpretation is that the difference is the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
A: This choice is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
B: This choice is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
C: This choice is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
D: This choice is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
E: This choice is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans described in the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) in research and how it is interpreted. FMRI uses a subtractive method to produce an image of the brain's activity during a cognitive task. The baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task. However, this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. Therefore, the neat functional localization depicted by differential brain scans is misleading.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Knowledge: Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that the Western scientific perspective and heritage that underpins the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology are already value-laden; therefore, the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. This approach is therefore viewed as distorting and an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. In order to achieve real understanding of another culture, it is necessary to adopt the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education. 
  The second proposal holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second form of multicultural education argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden. 
  They believe that to understand non-scientific cultures, one needs to adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied. 

Action: Answer("E") 
Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with choice E: "The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science." This is because they argue that non-western cultures cannot be adequately understood if they are examined solely through the methods of Western science, which is value-laden and distorting.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The critics of the second form of multicultural education believe that adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures is not essentially different from the first form of multicultural education, because the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version are still identifiably Western and thus value-laden.
A: This choice is incorrect because it does not reflect the objection raised in the second paragraph. 
B: This choice is not incorrect, but it does not reflect the objection raised in the second paragraph.
C: This choice is not incorrect, but it does not reflect the objection raised in the second paragraph.
D: This choice is incorrect because it does not reflect the objection raised in the second paragraph.
E: This choice is correct. Critics of the second form of multicultural education argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.

  The second paragraph discusses the objection to the second version of multicultural education, which holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. Critics of this second version argue that Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures, which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage, are already value-laden and cannot adequately understand non-Western cultures. Thus, understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  
A: This choice is not supported by the information given in the paragraph. It suggests that members of one culture cannot understand the values of another culture, which is not the main point of the objection discussed in the paragraph.
B: This choice is also not the main point of the objection discussed in the paragraph, although it might be a view shared by those who raise the objection.
C: This choice is too extreme and is not supported by the information given in the paragraph. While the objection does argue that understanding can be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied, it does not require more than one cultural perspective to be successful.
D: This choice is not supported by the information given in the paragraph. The objection argues that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible if one approaches it solely from the Western scientific perspective, but it does not suggest that the culture being studied must share the same cultural values.
E: This choice matches the main point of the objection discussed in the paragraph, which argues that Western scientific methods are already value-laden and cannot adequately understand non-Western cultures.

A: This answer choice is inconsistent with the objection raised in the second paragraph and the response to that objection. The objection is that understanding other cultures is impossible if it is approached solely from the majority culture's perspective, not that it is impossible for members of one culture to understand the values of another culture.
B: This answer choice is consistent with the objection raised in the second paragraph, but it is a more general statement about the role of historical and social circumstances in the development of a culture's values. It does not directly address the issue of understanding cultures from different perspectives.
C: This answer choice is similar to the response to the objection raised in the second paragraph, but it goes further by suggesting that understanding other cultures requires multiple cultural perspectives. There is no indication in the passage that proponents of the second version of multicultural education would agree with this statement.
D: This answer choice is inconsistent with the objection raised in the second paragraph and the response to that objection. The objection is that understanding other cultures is impossible if it is approached solely from the majority culture's perspective, not that it is impossible to understand cultures with different values.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances, and how secondary substances are responsible for the distinctive tastes and smells of plants. Insects have played a role in the development of secondary substances, and natural selection has favored those that serve as defense against insects. There has been an ongoing competition between plants and insects, leading to the development of increasingly specific relationships between plant and insect species. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, which can be classified as primary and secondary substances.
  Secondary substances are responsible for the characteristic smells and tastes of plants and have different roles in plant-insect interactions.
  Some secondary substances act as defenses against plant enemies, while some attract pollinating insects.
  The passage also mentions that there has been a competition between plants and insects that has led to the evolution of secondary substances.

Analysis:
  The main point of the passage is that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. The passage describes how secondary substances in plants have arisen through genetic mutations and have been conserved by natural selection due to their roles as scents that attract pollinating insects and biochemical defenses against insect enemies. The competition between plants and insects has led to the evolution of secondary substances, making the range of suitable food sources narrower for any one species of insect.

Answer("C"): The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the distinction between primary and secondary chemical substances in plants. 
  The secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and are the result of an evolutionary process involving interactions between plants and insects.
  Insects play a major role in the evolution of secondary substances, and natural selection favors substances that defend against insects.
  Over time, competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants, making it more difficult for any one species of insect to find suitable food.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the role of secondary substances in plants' chemical composition, their function as natural defenses against insects, and the evolutionary competition between plants and insects.
  A: This choice accurately describes the function of secondary substances in plants' chemical composition as natural defenses against insects, but it does not fully capture the evolutionary competition between plants and insects.
  B: This choice accurately describes the narrowing of the range of secondary substances in plants and insect species that eat each species of plant, but it does not fully capture the evolutionary competition between plants and insects.
  C: This choice accurately describes the evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects that led to the development of particular secondary substances in plants and their distinctive tastes and smells.
  D: This choice accurately describes the diversity and similarity of secondary substances among closely related species of plants, but it does not fully capture the evolutionary competition between plants and insects.
  E: This choice accurately describes the participation of plants in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects, but it does not fully capture the role of secondary substances in plants' chemical composition and their function as natural defenses against insects.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The passage discusses the role of secondary substances in giving plants their distinct tastes and smells and highlights the evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects that led to the development of these substances. It explains how insects have played a major role in the presence of secondary substances in plants. Therefore, the best option that accurately expresses the main point of the passage is that "the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects."
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
  - The passage talks about the secondary substances in plants that give them their distinctive tastes and smells and how they have evolved over time.
  - Insects play a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. 
  - Secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. They may also be defensive substances against plant-eating insects. 
  - The competition between plants and plant-eating insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant. 

Option A is incorrect because it only talks about one aspect of the secondary substances in plants, but it does not express the main point of the passage. 

Option B is incorrect because it is only one consequence of the long-term competition between plants and insects, but it is not the main point of the passage. 

Option C is correct because it expresses the main point of the passage, which is that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. 

Option D is incorrect because it is only partially correct. It is true that secondary substances tend to be similar among closely related species, but that is not the main point of the passage. 

Option E is incorrect because it is only one consequence of the development of secondary substances in plants, but it is not the main point of the passage.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and how it affects their taste and smell.
  It also discusses how secondary substances in plants can be beneficial, either as a biochemical defense against plant-eating insects or as a scent that attracts pollinating insects.
  Evolutionary competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.

Reasoning: 
  The main point of the passage is that the particular tastes and smells of plants, resulting from the secondary substances they contain, are largely due to an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. The passage discusses how some of these substances are biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects and how others are scents that attract pollinating insects. It also explains how insects have evolved ways to circumvent plant defenses and how this has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant. Choice (C) best captures the main point of the passage.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the two categories of chemical substances in plants: primary and secondary.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, and they have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms, or are biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, which are insects.
  Insects have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today.
  There has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects, and as the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect.
  Species of insects have tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.

Answer Explanation: 
Option A is partially correct, but does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is not only about the role of secondary substances as natural defenses against insect damage. Option B is incorrect because it focuses on the narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and the range of insect species that eat each species of plant, but this is not the main point of the passage. Option D is incorrect because it describes the diversity of secondary substances but does not fully address the evolutionary process that led to their development. Option E is partially correct but focuses on the role of plant mutations in secondary substance development, which is not the main focus of the passage. Option C accurately summarizes the main point of the passage, which is that the distinctive tastes and smells of present-day plants result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:

The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and their primary and secondary substances, the role of insects in the development of secondary substances, and the evolutionary competition between plants and insects. 

A: This choice accurately describes the role of secondary substances in plants as defenses against insects, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is the interaction between plants and insects in the development of secondary substances.

B: This choice accurately describes the narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and the range of insect species that eat each species of plant, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is the interaction between plants and insects in the development of secondary substances.

C: This choice accurately expresses the main point of the passage by stating that the particular secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

D: This choice accurately describes the diversity of secondary substances in plants and their similarity among closely related species, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is the interaction between plants and insects in the development of secondary substances.

E: This choice accurately describes the role of plant mutations in the development of secondary substances and the evolutionary competition between plants and insects, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is the interaction between plants and insects in the development of secondary substances.

Therefore, the best answer is C.
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the different categories of chemical substances in plants, how these substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, and how insects have played a role in the evolution of these substances. It also discusses the competition between plants and insects, and how this can lead to the evolution of new plant defenses or insect adaptations.

Analysis: The main point of the passage is that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants are largely the result of an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. This process has led to the development of secondary substances in plants, which can serve as natural defenses against insect damage and destruction. Over time, the competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants, and to a corresponding narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins
  B: endorse a claim simply because it is widely believed

  D: attempt to resolve an apparent paradox
  E: assert that their positions are supported by data
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses a paradox in which richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society, but over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. The author suggests that people compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income, leading to two phenomena: habituation and rivalry. The author provides evidence to support this claim. 
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. The author supports this claim by suggesting that we use material wealth to show that we are prosperous because we create value. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author of passage A argues that people's happiness depends on how they compare themselves to others in their society and that this leads to a paradox where despite growing wealth, society does not grow happier over time.
  The author of passage B argues that people's happiness comes from feeling successful and creating value, rather than simply having more money than others.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A explains the paradox of happiness and wealth and how people compare their income with some norm, which must be rising along with the actual income. The passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. And the desire to create value benefits society.
  A: The author of passage A and B do not explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins.
  B: The author of passage A and B do not endorse a claim simply because it is widely believed.
  C: The author of passage A does not accept a claim for the sake of the argument, but the author of passage B accepts the claim that people want to create value benefits society as evidence to support their argument.
  D: The author of passage A attempts to resolve an apparent paradox about happiness and wealth. The author of passage B does not attempt to resolve an apparent paradox.
  E: The author of passage A and B both assert that their positions are supported by data.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss two different explanations for why earning more money can make people happier.
  A: Passage A focuses on the phenomenon of habituation and rivalry as the reasons why earning more money does not result in long-term happiness. It explains how people compare their income with some norm and that norm must be rising along with actual income. The author also talks about how people overinvest in acquiring material possessions at the expense of leisure. 
  B: Passage B argues that earning more money makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. The author explains that wanting to create value benefits society and is really evidence of a desire to create value.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses research about the relationship between wealth and happiness, including the impact of habituation and rivalry on our sense of happiness.
  Passage B suggests that earning more money makes people feel successful and that a desire to create value benefits society.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Both authors assert that their positions are supported by data as they present research findings and evidence to support their arguments.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author of passage A argues that richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, but over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. The author explains this paradox in terms of two phenomena - habituation and rivalry.
  The author of passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. This, in turn, provides happiness.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A talks about research concerning happiness and wealth, and reveals a paradox between actual income and reported happiness. It discusses habituation and rivalry, and how people compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. 
  Passage B talks about the Solnick and Hemenway study and offers a different explanation of why earning more makes people happier. It argues that relative prosperity makes people feel successful and creates value, and it is the success - not the money per se - that provides happiness.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between happiness and wealth, and explains how people compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income.
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: Both authors attempt to resolve an apparent paradox. While Passage A discusses how richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, but over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer, Passage B argues against the idea that the urge to demonstrate our superiority is the explanation for happiness and instead argues that people feel successful and happy when they feel they have created value, and that material wealth is used to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. In both passages, the authors try to explain why happiness does not necessarily increase with increased wealth and success, since people's sense of what constitutes success or value changes in response to their context and perceived norms.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how the level of happiness and wealth is related, describing two phenomena: habituation and rivalry. It argues that people adjust to higher living standards, so the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income, and that people are happier when they compare themselves to those in their "reference group".
  Passage B disagrees with the theory that we care most about one-upmanship and argues that relative prosperity makes people feel successful, and that success, not money per se, is what provides happiness. It argues that the desire to create value benefits society and brings happiness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the paradox of wealth and happiness, and how people compare their income with some norm that rises along with actual income.
  Passage B challenges the idea that our urge to have more than others is solely based on a desire to demonstrate superiority for mating prospects, and argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful and that they have created value.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: Both authors attempt to resolve an apparent paradox in their respective passages. The author of Passage A explains the paradox of wealth and happiness, while the author of Passage B challenges the commonly held belief that money itself brings happiness by pointing to evidence that earning more makes people happy because relative prosperity makes them feel successful and that they have created value.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Passage B differs from passage A in that analogous displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more
Choices:
  A: engaged
  B: dismissive
  C: detached
  D: ironic
  E: skeptical
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A suggests that according to neuroscience, human behavior is caused by brain operations and that this suggests changes to how we should think about the law. It argues that people may not actually be making free and rational choices, and that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing people. 
  Passage B discusses the compatibility of free will with determinism, and argues that actions are free if they are not constrained by external sources. It distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions and argues that actions originating from a disease-free brain are free.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that neuroscience suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world.
  Ayer's theory of soft determinism distinguishes between free and constrained actions.
  Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses recent findings in neuroscience and their implications for the law. The passage suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution and instead focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism. It suggests that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A suggests that neuroscientific findings and the viewpoint that you are your brain should change the way we think about the law. The author believes that neuroscience undermines the idea of retribution as a justification for punishment, and suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism, and argues that actions can still be considered free even in a deterministic world. The author introduces the concept of "soft determinism" and suggests that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. 

Action: Answer("C")  
Passage B differs from Passage A in that it discusses the concept of free will and determinism in a more detached way. The author presents an argument and introduces a concept, but does not advocate for any particular policy or action. Passage A, on the other hand, makes a particular argument about how the law should change in light of neuroscientific findings.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A suggests that the viewpoint of neuroscience radically changes the way we think about the law and that it should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  Passage B talks about the concept of free will coexisting with determinism and describes Ayer's theory of "soft determinism."
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Passage B is more detached than Passage A, as it presents Ayer's theory as a past argument, without any engagement or skepticism. It presents the idea neutrally and without any emotional bias. On the other side, Passage A suggests that the recent findings in neuroscience radically change the perspective of the law and that it should shift from retribution to deterrence, suggesting an engaged attitude towards the ideas it discusses.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A suggests that recent findings in neuroscience change the way we think about the law, and calls for a shift in focus from retribution to deterrence.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between free will and determinism, and presents Ayer's theory of "soft determinism."
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that free will is an illusion and our behavior is completely determined by the operations of our brains. It suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution and focus on deterring future harms. 
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism and distinguishes between free and constrained actions. It proposes that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined. 

Action: Answer("C") 
Passage B appears to take a more detached and analytical approach to the ideas it discusses, whereas Passage A takes a more engaged and opinionated approach.
Response 7:
Knowledge: Passage A argues that the law should abandon the idea of retribution and instead focus on deterring future harms, based on the idea that people's behavior is caused solely by their brain. Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism if we distinguish between free and constrained actions. 

Action: Answer("C") 
Both passages present different ideas about the relationship between neuroscience and the law, but Passage B is more detached in tone and presents a philosophical argument that is not directly related to the practical implications for the criminal justice system. Therefore, Passage B is more detached in attitude towards the ideas it discusses compared to Passage A, which presents a more engaged and practical argument for changing the law based on recent findings in neuroscience. 
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that the law should abandon retribution as a justification for punishing bad people, and instead focus on deterring future harms. It suggests that neuroscience, which claims that all behavior is caused by the operations of the brain, challenges our idea of free will and rationality.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

  The strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be one that supports the claim that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. 
  Choice A is not relevant to the issue of whether adopting the perspectives and methods of non-Western cultures is necessary for genuine understanding.
  Choice B is also not relevant as the passage acknowledges that non-Western cultures have different value systems.
  Choice C is also not relevant as the passage does not discuss whether some non-Western cultures use their own value systems when studying other cultures.
  Choice D is also not relevant as the passage discusses the criticism that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting, not that Western scientific methods are necessary to understand Western culture.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage discusses two different versions of multicultural education. The first version advocates for teaching about other cultures using the values of the majority culture, while the second version advocates for adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but using Western scientific methods to examine them.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

  Proverb use is shaped by both the individual speaker and the larger community.
  Proverbs are often used to foster a consciousness of ethnicity and to maintain links to Mexican culture.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The passage states that "Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs." However, it also suggests that "proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts." Therefore, the way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used. Choice A is incorrect because the passage specifically states that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose, which would include reinforcing community-approved norms. Choice C is too strong - while the regulation of peer-group relationships is highlighted as a common focus of proverb use, it is not necessarily the most frequent use. Choice D is incorrect because while proverbs may be used to help teach languages, the passage specifies that they serve a didactic purpose in general, not specifically related to language teaching. Finally, the passage does not suggest that proverbs are usually intended to serve more than one purpose when used as an educational tool, so Choice E is also incorrect.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The first proposal for multicultural education is to teach about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture, using the values of liberalism.
  The second proposal for multicultural education is to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and to use Western methods of examination, study, and explanation such as anthropology and sociology.
  Critics of both proposals argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective or through the Western scientific heritage that involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
Action: Answer("C") 
According to the passage, the study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would be the most objectionable to proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph because it involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity that are part of the Western scientific heritage.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The first version of multicultural education advocates for teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values of democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons.
  The second version of multicultural education advocates for taking a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still using the methods of Western science to examine and explain cultures.
  Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that trying to understand non-scientific cultures through the methods of Western science is an expression of cultural chauvinism.

Action: Answer("C")  
According to the passage, proponents of the second version of multicultural education would likely object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version holds that schools should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, but the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture should be used.
  The second version holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms and that a neutral stance should be adopted with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still uses the methods of Western science.
  Critics of the second version argue that the methods of Western science are already value-laden and should not be used to understand nonscientific cultures.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: According to the third paragraph, critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that "To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science." Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be objectionable to proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph discusses a second version of multicultural education that adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but uses Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures. Critics argue that this approach is still value-laden and distorting, and that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.

Analysis:
  The question asks which one of the following would most likely be objectionable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education. The correct answer should be something that involves using Western methods to study and understand non-Western cultures, as this is precisely what the proponents of the second version of multicultural education are criticized for.

Answer: C
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The third version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms and adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are value laden and involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity, which is a Western scientific perspective and heritage.
  To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The third paragraph explains the objections of critics of the second version of multicultural education who argue that adopting the Western scientific perspective to examine other cultures is not essentially different from the first version of multicultural education that examines other cultures from the majority culture's perspective.
  A: The passage does not indicate that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would find this objectionable.
  B: The passage does not indicate that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would find this objectionable.
  C: The third paragraph argues that critics object to this version of multicultural education because it employs Western scientific methods to investigate nonscientific cultures.
  D: The passage does not indicate that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would find this objectionable.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education that advocates for a neutral stance on cultural values. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version are still identifiably Western. Critics argue that this is not essentially different from the first version that teaches about other cultures from the majority culture's perspective. The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. Thus, the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The third paragraph discusses a second version of multicultural education that holds that multicultural education should adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still Western methods, such as those of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology.

Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
  D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  E: "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.

  Corridos are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. 
  The narratives of corridos deal with subject matter specific to the Border region and combine formal features of several different types of folk songs.
  Corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings and affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities when sung at social gatherings. 
  Corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly without embellishments, and their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. 
  The corrido is composed of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. 
  The despedida is the formal closing verse of the corrido.
  
A: The passage does not provide any information to support this inference. 
B: The passage mentions "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870) as the oldest corrido surviving in complete form. Therefore, this inference is not supported by the passage. 
C: The passage states that the corrido is composed of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This supports this inference. 
D: The passage mentions that the despedida is the formal closing verse of the corrido. The second and fourth lines of the despedida are variable, which suggests that most corrido variants do not have the same despedida. Therefore, this inference is not supported by the passage. 
E: The passage states that "El Corrido de Kiansis" records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s and is the oldest corrido surviving in complete form. This suggests that "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone from the Border region. Therefore, this inference is not supported by the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans, which is caused by a new type of protein pathogen called "prion". Prions reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.

In the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, and that there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would be least likely to agree with the statement that "Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease."
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen, and its association with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a fatal degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  The passage indicates that prions are infectious agents that do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction and that the body does not produce an immune response to them.
  The passage does not mention any possibility of recovery from CJD.
  The passage discusses the extensive research aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD, which has led to the discovery of prions and the realization that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions.

A: The passage supports the idea that abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue are associated with neurological disease.
B: The passage discusses the inevitability of death from CJD, so it would be unlikely that the author agrees with the idea that some patients will recover from the disease.
C: The passage discusses the discovery of prions, which lack nucleic acid, and their ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way.
D: The passage indicates that the body does not produce an immune response to prions and that there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, so it would be unlikely that the author disagrees with the idea that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
E: The passage discusses the incomplete understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce themselves.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that prions are a new type of protein pathogen that lacks nucleic acid and are responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Prions are naturally found in the body as normal proteins, but they can convert into an abnormal shape and induce other proteins to transform, creating a plaque in the brain that destroys nerve cells. Since prions do not contain nucleic acid, the body does not produce an immune response, and there is no known effective therapy for preventing the chain reaction process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. CJD is inevitably fatal. It is believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage clearly states that CJD is inevitably fatal, with wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. There is no known cure or effective therapy for preventing the chain reaction process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with choice B, which suggests that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease, as this contradicts the information presented in the passage.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the discovery of prions, an entirely new class of infectious pathogens, which are responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  CJD is invariably fatal and there is no cure.
  Prions convert their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape and induce normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  The exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.

Elimination:
  A: The passage describes how the abnormal shaped prions in brain tissue are responsible for CJD, so this choice is likely to be agreed by the author. Not the answer.
  B: The passage states that CJD is invariably fatal, and there is no cure. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the author would agree with this statement. This is the correct answer.
  C: The passage describes how prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction. Therefore, it is likely that the author would agree with this statement. Not the answer.
  D: The passage states that the body does not produce an immune response when prions are present. Therefore, it is likely that the author would agree with this statement. Not the answer.
  E: The passage describes how the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. Therefore, it is likely that the author would agree with this statement. Not the answer.

Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the characteristics of prions and the discovery that they are responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). 
  A: The passage describes how prions transform into an abnormal shape and accumulate in the brain, destroying nerve cells. This process is responsible for the neurological symptoms associated with CJD.
  B: The passage does not suggest that recovery from CJD is possible. In fact, the passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal.
  C: The passage describes how prions lack nucleic acid but are able to reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  D: The passage describes how prions are able to reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction without eliciting an immune response from the body. This implies that the body does not have a natural defense against prions.
  E: The passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The passage describes the discovery of a new type of pathogen called prions, which are protein-based and do not contain nucleic acid. Prions cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a neurodegenerative disease that is inevitably fatal. Prions occur naturally in the body as harmless proteins but are able to convert into a dangerous, abnormal form that is infectious and can reproduce itself by inducing other normally shaped prions to transform into the abnormal conformation. The body does not produce an immune response to prions, and there is no effective therapy for CJD.

A: The passage explicitly states that the presence of abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement. 
B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, and there is no cure or therapy for the disease. Therefore, the author is unlikely to agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
C: The passage describes how prions are protein-based and do not contain nucleic acid, which challenges the assumption that all pathogens contain genetic material. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement.
D: The passage describes how the body does not produce an immune response to prions, which means that the body has no natural defense against CJD. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement.
E: The passage describes how scientists have yet to fully understand the mechanism by which prions reproduce, despite extensive research. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement.

  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia in humans that is inevitably fatal and has no effective therapy.
  Prions are composed mainly or exclusively of protein and lack nucleic acid, unlike other pathogens.
  Prions reproduce themselves in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  The body does not produce an immune response when prions are present.
  The exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
  
A: The passage supports the idea that the presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so it is unlikely that the author would agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
C: The passage discusses the discovery that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction, so it is unlikely that the author would disagree with this statement.
D: The passage states that the body does not produce an immune response when prions are present, so it is unlikely that the author would disagree with this statement.
E: The passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood, so it is unlikely that the author would disagree with this statement.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans caused by a pathogen called a prion. Prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into a pathogenic conformation. It is believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions. There is no effective therapy for CJD, and it is inevitably fatal.
A: The passage describes the presence of abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue as a sign of neurological disease, specifically Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Therefore, the author would NOT disagree with this statement.
B: The passage states that there is no effective therapy for CJD and that it is inevitably fatal. Therefore, the author would disagree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
C: The passage discusses prions as a pathogen that reproduces without nucleic acid. Therefore, the author would NOT disagree with this statement.
D: The passage states that the body does not produce an immune response to prions because they occur naturally in the body as proteins, and there is no effective therapy for CJD. Therefore, the author would NOT disagree with this statement.
E: The passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. Therefore, the author would NOT disagree with this statement.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the utility maximization principle and how it explains the rationality of committing a crime as a choice that maximizes expected utility, and how both deterrence strategies of changing societal norms and institutions and increasing penalties and law enforcement are complementary and effective in lowering the expected utility of committing a crime.
A: The waiter's decision to conceal part of his tip income from the government to reduce his taxes is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because he believes that the benefit of reducing his taxes outweighs the risk of detection and penalties.
B: The motorist's decision to avoid speeding on a heavily patrolled road to avoid a speeding ticket and loss of her driver's license is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because she believes that the benefit of avoiding a speeding ticket and license loss outweighs the benefit of speeding.
C: The industrialist's decision to continue to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because he believes that the benefit of saving money on treatment outweighs the risk of detection and penalties.
D: The government official's decision to solicit bribes to supplement her inadequate government salary is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because she believes that the benefit of supplementing her salary outweighs the risk of prosecution and penalties.
E: The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because of perceived unfair dismissal is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives because physical assault does not provide any economic benefit or disincentive. It is an impulsive crime.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the utility maximization principle, which states that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The passage then goes on to explain how this principle can be used to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. Within this framework, both increasing penalties for crimes and strengthening law enforcement and increasing economic opportunities for the most economically alienated individuals can affect the utility equation, making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. 
A: This scenario involves a person trying to reduce their taxes by concealing a large part of their tip income from the government because they believe it is unlikely they will be caught. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as they are trying to maximize their overall satisfaction by reducing their tax burden.
B: This scenario involves a person following the speed limit on a heavily patrolled stretch of road to avoid getting a ticket and losing their driver's license. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as they are trying to maximize their overall satisfaction by avoiding a costly penalty.
C: This scenario involves a person continuing to illegally discharge pollutants into a river because the cost of treatment is higher than the fine for illegal discharge. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as they are trying to maximize their overall satisfaction by minimizing their costs and penalties.
D: This scenario involves a government official in an impoverished country risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because their government salary is inadequate to support them and their family. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as they are trying to maximize their overall satisfaction by finding alternative means of supporting themselves.
E: This scenario involves a worker physically assaulting their supervisor because they were dismissed from their job and believe it was unfair. This is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as the worker is not attempting to maximize their overall satisfaction by weighing the costs and benefits of their actions. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage explains that the utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. 
A: A waiter concealing a large part of his tip income from the government to reduce his taxes is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives since he is attempting to maximize his overall satisfaction by reducing his tax liability.
B: A motorist avoiding speeding on a certain stretch of road to avoid losing her driver's license is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives since she is attempting to avoid a negative consequence (losing her license) and maximize her overall satisfaction.
C: An industrialist continuing to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives since he is trying to maximize profits by avoiding the cost of treatment.
D: A government official in an impoverished country risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives since she is attempting to maximize her overall satisfaction by finding a way to support herself and her family.
E: A worker physically assaulting his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives since it is an impulsive crime that is unlikely to maximize his overall satisfaction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the utility maximization principle that holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility, which is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Rational individuals will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity. The two positions in the deterrence debate, increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime versus changing people's beliefs about crime and increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, are reconciled under the utility maximization principle.
Action: Answer("E")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the concept of utility maximization, wherein rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  A: A waiter concealing his tip income to reduce taxes is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, and is an action that maximizes his expected utility.
  B: A motorist avoiding speeding on a heavily patrolled stretch of road to avoid losing her driver's license is a rational response to economic disincentives, and is an action that maximizes her expected utility.
  C: An industrialist continuing to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, and is an action that maximizes their expected utility.
  D: A government official risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because of inflation is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, and is an action that maximizes her expected utility.
  E: A worker physically assaulting his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, and is not an action that maximizes his expected utility.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage explains the utility maximization principle, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
A: The waiter is concealing his income from the government to reduce his taxes. He believes that it is unlikely that he will be detected and punished. This action of the waiter is in response to economic incentives and disincentives and can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
B: The motorist is avoiding speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily monitored and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license. This action of the motorist is in response to economic incentives and disincentives and can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
C: The industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. This action of the industrialist is in response to economic incentives and disincentives and can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
D: The government official risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. This action of the government official is in response to economic incentives and disincentives and can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This action of the worker is not in response to economic incentives and disincentives and cannot be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage argues that the utility maximization principle allows for a rational economic analysis of crime deterrence methods, where rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this principle, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  A: The waiter's action of concealing a large part of his tip income from the government is a rational response to economic incentives if he believes it is unlikely to be detected and that the cost of being caught is less than the amount he would save by not reporting the income.
  B: The motorist's action of avoiding speeding on a certain stretch of road is a rational response to economic disincentives if she values her driver's license more than the benefits of speeding.
  C: The industrialist's action of continuing to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into the river is a rational response to economic incentives if the cost of treatment exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: The government official's action of soliciting bribes is a rational response to economic incentives if her government salary is inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: The worker's action of physically assaulting his former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives. It is a crime of passion, and therefore, an impulsive crime that cannot be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle in the context of crime deterrence, which holds that given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
A: The waiter in this example is responding rationally to economic incentives and disincentives by concealing a large part of his tip income from the government in order to reduce his taxes.
B: The motorist in this example is responding rationally to economic incentives and disincentives by avoiding speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
C: The industrialist in this example is responding rationally to economic incentives and disincentives by continuing to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
D: The government official in this example is responding rationally to economic incentives and disincentives by soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
E: The worker in this example may not be responding rationally to economic incentives and disincentives by physically assaulting his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. The action does not appear to be based on a rational economic choice, but rather an impulsive one.
Action: Answer("E")

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage addresses the way the elite commissioned art, and how sociohistorical interpretations of art tend to view art as a reflection of the ideals and values of the elite. 
  A: This answer choice is incorrect because it only addresses part of the passage and does not express the main point.
  B: This answer choice is tempting, but it is incorrect because it only addresses the view of sociohistorical interpretations of art and not the main point of the passage.
  C: This answer choice is incorrect because it only addresses the motivation of patrons of the arts, and not the main point of the passage.
  D: This answer choice is a bit too specific as it mentions only one part of the argument presented by the passage. Although the passage does touch upon psychoanalytical thought, it is not the central point of the passage.
  E: This answer choice accurately summarizes the main point of the passage by discussing the two different ways members of the elite commissioned art and how sociohistorical interpretations of art view it. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the historical production of art by and for political and social elites. It states that there were two different ways in which art was produced for elites and that sociohistorical critics analyze art produced the second way (as a reflection of the ideology of the elite). It also mentions that historically, two social classes were able to commission art: the aristocratic or governing class and the well-to-do middle class. The passage critiques the view that all art produced for elites reflects their values and ideals, suggesting that some artists may have subverted the patron's intentions, and that some art that went against the grain of elite values endured over time. The passage also suggests that the sociohistorical analysis of art produced for elites requires a recognizable identity and consensus among elites and may involve a Freudian analysis to uncover hidden meanings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the production of art by and for political and social elites, and the ways in which sociohistorical critics analyze such art. It also highlights the fact that the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce art that endures, and that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
Option A: This option is partially correct, as it highlights that historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes. However, it does not accurately capture the nuances of the passage regarding the types of art produced and the ways in which sociohistorical critics analyze it.
Option B: This option is partially correct, as it argues that sociohistorical interpretations of art are overly simplistic. However, it does not accurately capture the main point of the passage, which is about the production of art by and for political and social elites.
Option C: This option is not accurate, as the passage does not suggest that patrons of the arts were primarily interested in their reputation.
Option D: This option is partially correct, as it argues that sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify their claims about the embodiment of elite ideals in works of art. However, it does not accurately capture the main point of the passage, which is about the production of art by and for political and social elites.
Option E: This option most accurately expresses the main point of the passage, as it highlights the two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them, and the ways in which sociohistorical critics analyze such art.
 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")

The passage discusses how sociohistorical critics view art produced for and by the elite in terms of reflecting the values and ideals of the elite. However, the passage notes that this view is oversimplified and that there are two ways in which members of the elite had art produced for them. The passage also discusses how talented artists sometimes had to work on the margins of the establishment because the taste of the elite classes was not always apt to produce enduring art. The main point of the passage is that sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify their claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite, even when the evidence appears to conflict with this claim. Therefore, the best answer is D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how art has been historically produced by and for political and social elites in 2 different ways. The first way was by engaging a well-known artist to produce something for display, while the second way was to create or have created a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life. The sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced the second way because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage discusses the sociohistorical interpretation of art produced by and for political and social elites, and argues that there are two different ways in which art was historically produced for such elites. The passage also argues that for sociohistorical critics to claim that such art embodies the ideology of the elite, they must eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. The main point of the passage is that the sociohistorical interpretation of art as a reflection of the ideals and values of the elite is overly simplistic and that there are more nuanced factors at play. Therefore, the most accurate answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the historical production of art by and for political and social elites.
  It distinguishes between two ways that art is produced for elites and discusses the challenges of analyzing this art.
  The passage does not discuss the motivations of patrons of the arts in general.
  The passage does not argue that sociohistorical interpretations of art are overly simplistic.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the historical production of art by and for political and social elites.
  It distinguishes two ways in which members of the elite classes had art produced for them.
  It presents the difficulties encountered by sociohistorical critics in interpreting the meaning and significance of works of art produced by the elite.
  It also addresses the limitations of the taste of the aristocracy and the well-to-do middle class in producing art that endures.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The main point of the passage is to criticize a narrow view of sociohistorical art criticism that claims that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes. The passage points out that there are different ways in which art was produced for the elite classes, and that some artists and works went against the grain of elite values. The passage also suggests that the relationship between patron and artist was not always straightforward and that the sociohistorical critic must engage in a more nuanced analysis that takes into account the complexities of this relationship. Therefore, the most accurate choice is B.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the historical production of art by the elite classes, and the ways in which sociohistorical critics analyze this art. The author argues that there are two ways in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites," and that critics who analyze this art must take into account the possibility that the artist subverted the patron's ideals. The author also notes that historically, the aristocratic and middle classes were the primary patrons of the arts, and that their taste was not always apt to produce art that endures.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10)
  C: "markedly inclusive" (line 16)
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24)
  E: "alien to the European style" (line 51)

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence

Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art that generated a complex result. Lichtenstein's images were fine art but at first difficult to see because they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  For the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  The author also says that the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  
A: This statement suggests that even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions, there are still businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region. This statement does not undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power. 
B: This statement is not relevant to the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This statement reinforces the idea that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly since businesses collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would. This statement does not undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
D: This statement suggests that different industries have different thresholds for achieving increasing returns to scale. This statement does not undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power. 
E: This statement suggests that there are factors that can offset any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized. This statement is not relevant to the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly power, but for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. The idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
A: This option describes the existence of local monopolies despite the presence of larger firms in other regions, which does not necessarily undermine the argument that increasing returns to scale lead to natural monopoly power.
B: This option refers to a potential consequence of increased specialization, but it does not address the argument that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly power.
C: This option describes a situation in which businesses are colluding to set prices, which supports the argument that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly power.
D: This option suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies from industry to industry, but it does not necessarily undermine the argument that increasing returns to scale lead to natural monopoly power.
E: This option describes a potential offset to the gains achieved through increased specialization, which does not address the argument that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly power.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage describes a contradiction between two economic concepts: the Pin Factory, or increasing returns to scale, and the Invisible Hand, which works best when there are many competitors in the market. The author argues that the assumption of diminishing returns to scale dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, but since the late 1970s, increasing returns have gained more attention as economists have found ways to describe the Pin Factory with rigor. The passage also states that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly.

A: This statement provides an example of how a large business in one region can exert monopoly power, which is consistent with the argument that increasing returns lead to monopoly. It does not directly undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
B: This statement describes a potential negative consequence of specializing workers, but it does not address the relationship between increasing returns and monopoly power, which is the focus of the passage.
C: This statement supports the argument that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which is consistent with the passage.
D: This statement suggests that the size necessary to achieve increasing returns varies by industry, which does not directly undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. However, it does suggest that the relationship between increasing returns and monopoly power may be more complex than the passage suggests.
E: This statement describes potential offsetting factors to the gains in productivity achieved by increasing the specialization of workers, but it does not address the relationship between increasing returns and monopoly power.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that there is a contradiction between the idea of increasing returns to scale and the idea that free markets require many competitors to prevent monopoly power.
  A: This statement provides an example of how larger businesses do not necessarily always have an advantage over smaller businesses, but it does not directly address the relationship between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  B: This statement describes a potential downside to the specialization of workers, but it does not directly address the relationship between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  C: This statement reinforces the idea that a few players in an industry can exert monopoly power, which is consistent with the author's argument.
  D: This statement does not undermine the author's argument, as the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale is not relevant to the possibility of monopoly power.
  E: This statement explores potential limitations to the gains in productivity from specialization, but it does not directly address the relationship between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author writes that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. 
  The author also states that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  The author connects increasing returns to scale with the potential for a natural tendency toward monopoly power.
Choice Analysis:
  A: This statement does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it suggests that certain businesses may still be able to exert monopoly power within their own regions.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C: This statement reinforces the idea that a natural tendency toward monopoly power exists when an industry is dominated by only a few players.
  D: This statement may provide an alternative explanation for why not all industries may experience a natural tendency toward monopoly power, but it does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is due to the fact that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, as a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. However, the invisible hand works properly only if there are many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
A: The fact that some businesses are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region would not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it is possible that these businesses have achieved a larger scale and hence lower costs than their competitors. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.
B: The fact that workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.
C: The fact that businesses often collude in order to set prices does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as this collusion is only possible if there are only a few players dominating the industry. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.
D: This answer choice does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as the author acknowledges that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.
E: This answer choice, if true, would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it suggests that the gains in productivity achieved by making workers more specialized are offset by other factors. Therefore, the best answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that increasing returns to scale in an industry tend to create a natural tendency toward monopoly, as large businesses can achieve larger scale and lower costs than small businesses. However, for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. The idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  
A: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it acknowledges that some businesses are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region. This does not contradict the fact that increasing returns to scale tend to create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
B: The statement is not related to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This statement supports the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it suggests that businesses that dominate an industry may collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
D: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It simply acknowledges that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies across industries.
E: This statement is not related to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how increasing returns to scale (e.g. increased efficiency through increased size) can lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly, as larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business until only a few players dominate the industry. The author explains that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. This implies that if there are only a few players in the industry, the connection between increased size and monopoly power would not be undermined. 
  A: This answer choice does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it suggests that some businesses are able to exert monopoly power even in the presence of larger businesses in other regions. 
  B: This answer choice does not directly address the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
  C: This answer choice reinforces the idea that a few players dominating an industry can lead to monopoly power, which supports the author's argument rather than undermining it. 
  D: This answer choice suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns varies widely from industry to industry, which could indicate that the connection between size and monopoly power is not as straightforward as the author suggests. 
  E: This answer choice does not directly address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Diminishing returns to scale are assumed to dominate economic theory in the past.
  The author explains that increasing returns were not represented in mainstream economic thought for a long time because it was hard to represent them mathematically.

A: This statement, if true, suggests that the connection between increased size and monopoly power might not always hold. However, it does not undermine the author's argument that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly. Therefore, this is not the best choice.
B: This statement is about the salaries of workers, and it is not related to the argument put forth by the author on the connection between increased size and monopoly power. Therefore, this is not the best choice.
C: This statement actually supports the author's argument that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly. Therefore, this is not the best choice.
D: This statement suggests that the size that a business must reach to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. If true, it would weaken the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it suggests that not all businesses will be able to achieve increasing returns to scale and, therefore, will not necessarily lead to monopoly power. This is the correct choice.
E: This statement is about the limitations of increasing returns to scale and how they can be offset by other factors, but it is not related to the author's argument on the connection between increased size and monopoly power. Therefore, this is not the best choice.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a contradiction between two concepts: the Pin Factory, which emphasizes increasing returns to scale, and the Invisible Hand, which depends on many competitors in each industry.
  The passage asserts that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which undermines the idea of many competitors in each industry.
  The passage further asserts that the assumption of diminishing returns to scale, rather than increasing returns, dominated economic theory for almost two centuries and made it difficult to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: If the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, then it is less likely that bigger firms will drive smaller firms out of business. This weakens the natural tendency toward monopoly, which would undermine the idea of many competitors in each industry, and therefore undermines the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature

- Dostoyevsky took a unique position regarding realism in literature.
- He believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
- For Dostoyevsky, reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
- The fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real, and a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit.
- The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
- The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.

Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society. He thought that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. He believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms, and the radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.

Action: Answer("D")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's view of literature and his position on the debate between two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. 
  A: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for him there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. 
  B: The passage does not mention Dostoyevsky's view of realism in literature in relation to the representation of political views. 
  C: The passage does not state that Dostoyevsky believed that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality; in fact, he believed that reality was literature's crucial source. 
  D: The passage states that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source and never doubted that reality was important in literature. However, he disagreed with the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" since reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and he believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. 
  E: The passage describes Dostoyevsky's view that reality was literature's crucial source and that his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on art and literature in opposition to the two dominant literary criticism positions in Russia during his time.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality is literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than that of the radical critics. He believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and that reality was far more than the merely tangible. He also believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. He disagreed with the radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view because for Dostoyevsky, a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." He did not believe that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. 
  The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. He did not believe in assigning to art "a shameful destiny."

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?

  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.

Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses anthropologist and choreographer Katherine Dunham's approach to research in dance ethnology.
  Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too involved in the dances she was observing.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
Action: Answer("C") 
The passage describes how Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances and because they subscribed to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. However, the author describes how Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time, and that she was able to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices through prolonged immersion of this kind. Therefore, the author would most likely agree that Dunham's colleagues were incorrect to advise her to increase the degree of her detachment and that extensive personal investment in fieldwork can enhance scientific rigor.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how Katherine Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques to the mainstream was due to her training in both anthropological research and choreography. 
  Dunham's colleagues advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, but she often participated in the dances herself.
  The view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment is now recognized as unrealistic. 
  Dunham's work was crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right.
Action: Answer("C")  
The passage states that Dunham's colleagues advised her to increase the degree of her detachment in order to conduct effective data gathering, but the author disagrees with this view, stating that "the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment". Therefore, the author would most likely agree with choice C, which states that Dunham's colleagues were incorrect in advising her to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how Katherine Dunham was successful in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance by combining her training in anthropological research and choreography.
  The passage also mentions that colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing and to not participate in them herself.
  The author suggests that Dunham's approach to research, which involved participation in the dances herself, was effective.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of the dance-isolation technique and her success in bringing traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern North American dance. 
  The passage also describes the methodology used by Dunham in her anthropological research on Caribbean dance forms and the advice given to her by her colleagues in anthropology regarding her participation in the dances she was observing.
  
Analysis:
  The question asks about the author's opinion on the colleagues who advised Dunham about her research methodology. The passage suggests that the colleagues advised Dunham to maintain a certain degree of detachment from the dances she was observing, both for her safety and to maintain scientific rigor. However, the passage also suggests that Dunham's approach, which involved participating in the dances herself, was ultimately successful in helping her to understand and teach the techniques she was observing. 
  Based on this information, it is unlikely that the author would agree that the colleagues were correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, as injury sustained during fieldwork is not mentioned as a significant concern. The author might agree that the colleagues were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, as her skill in performing them improved with experience. However, the passage suggests that Dunham's approach of participating in the dances herself was ultimately successful. The author might also agree that the colleagues were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner, as the passage suggests that Dunham's personal investment in fieldwork enhanced her scientific understanding. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the colleagues made this assumption. Finally, the passage does not suggest that the colleagues assumed that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology. 
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by the power of jury nullification and argues that juries are not legislators and may not have sufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can serve a useful function by acting as a safety valve and indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification creates problems because the jury's power to nullify is unchecked, they may not have sufficient evidence to make an informed decision, and they are not legislators.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can act as a safety valve to prevent overzealous prosecutors and police, and can be a useful indicator of problems with a law.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Both passages seem to agree that juries should apply the law, but not interpret it. Passage A argues that the jury is not legislators, and Passage B argues that the legislature is responsible for creating general laws. Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by the power of jury nullification, stating that juries are unaccountable and have no obligation to think through the effect of an acquittal on others. It argues that the proper place for disagreement on the reach of criminal laws is in public, where revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated.
  
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful function when the jury believes a law is unjust or when there are extenuating circumstances. It suggests that when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it can indicate to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question. 
  
   A: Both passages agree that juries are not required to explain their verdicts, but they do not disagree on whether juries should be more forthcoming. This is not the main focus of either passage, so it is not the answer.
  
  B: Both passages agree that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people. They may disagree on whether the proper place for disagreement on the reach of criminal laws is in public or in the jury room, but this is not the main focus of either passage, so it is not the answer.
  
  C: Passage A suggests that juries may be more biased than elected officials because they are unelected and unaccountable, while Passage B suggests that the use of jury nullification can help overcome overzealousness by police and prosecutors. However, this is not the main point of disagreement between the two passages, so it is not the answer.
  
  D: This is the main point of disagreement between the two passages. Passage A argues that the jury is not a legislative body and should not be interpreting the law. Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful function when the jury believes a law is unjust or when there are extenuating circumstances. So, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  
  E: Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful function when the jury believes a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. It suggests that when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it can indicate to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question. However, neither passage argues that police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue, so this is not the answer.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains the problems with jury nullification. It argues that juries often have insufficient evidence, and that jurors are not elected officials, which means that they are unaccountable and have no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. 
  Passage B argues that a jury may act as a safety valve when police or prosecutors are overzealous, and that when jurors nullify a law because it is unjust, they are performing a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature. It argues that nullification is likely to be uncommon, and that a jury will only nullify a law if the case for nullification is compelling enough that all twelve jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the debate over whether biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research and how some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. However, the author argues that granting a patent does not imply granting the right to deny access to biological materials. Additionally, patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
A: The passage does not suggest this as the reason why scientists freely shared research materials in the early days of biotechnology research. Rather, it suggests that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model.
B: The passage does not make this claim. Rather, it suggests that researchers fear that patent holders may charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials.
C: The passage states that patent litigation is expensive and usually only initiated to protect a market position or an exclusive patent licensee. The passage also suggests that judges deciding patent cases have respected a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Therefore, the passage would agree with this statement.
D: The opposite is suggested in the passage, which states that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly support intellectual property protection because of their reliance on research funding that is partially conditional on the patentability of their results.
E: The passage does not suggest that scientists who oppose patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection. Rather, the passage discusses the concerns of some researchers about the perceived threat to basic research related to restrictions on access to research materials.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation

Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
The most useful information to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer would be to test the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine, given that chlorine is one of the elements that depletes the ozone layer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, and destroy the ozone.
  Molina and Rowland's advocacy of dramatic policy changes led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.

Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  If a chemical breaks down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, it may be unsafe for the environment because it would release chemicals that attack and deplete the ozone layer. Therefore, testing to see if a chemical would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. So, the correct answer is E.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon

  A disturbing force is described in passage A as one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists use to derive a theory's predictions, which could be false and cause the theory to fail.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  In passage B, astronomers predicted the orbit of Mercury, but the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. This failure of the prediction could be due to the presence of a disturbing force.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  In passage A, the author discusses Popper's use of the logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence and the need for auxiliary premises when deriving predictions from scientific theories.
  In passage B, astronomers made predictions about the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.

Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: 
  None of the planets listed (Uranus, Neptune, and Mercury) are described as disturbing forces in passage B. Instead, astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet (Neptune) and later revised their assumptions based on Einstein's theory of relativity. The moon is not relevant to the passage.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science.
  In passage B, astronomers made predictions about Uranus and Mercury based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. 
  The astronomers explained the failure of their prediction for Uranus by hypothesizing the existence of another planet - Neptune. 
  They also hypothesized another planet - Vulcan - based on the failure of their prediction for Mercury.
  Passage A also mentions that auxiliary premises appeal to other theories and the correct functioning of instrumentation, as well as the absence of disturbing forces.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  The passage B states that astronomers predicted the orbit of Mercury based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. When the prediction was not borne out, they hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. This indicates that there might be the presence of a disturbing force affecting the prediction. Therefore, the answer is D, Mercury.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A discusses the power of negative evidence. It explains that a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper, the author of this theory, considers that searching for negative evidence is at the heart of scientific research.

When scientists derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  
  Passage B explains how scientists discovered the planet Neptune by changing their assumptions about the existence of other planets and hypothesizing the existence of another planet in the vicinity. It also shows how scientists used Einstein's general theory of relativity to calculate the observed orbit of Mercury.

Analysis:
  To answer this question correctly, we need to identify which of the given options most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A.

  Uranus, Neptune, and Mercury are the planets mentioned in the passage. The sun is a star, and the moon is a natural satellite of the Earth.

  The passage B mentions disturbing forces in the context of auxiliary assumptions about the correct functioning of instrumentation and the absence of disturbing forces that scientists use when deriving a theory's predictions.

  Uranus and Neptune's orbits were affected by the gravitational pull of the other planets which made the astronomers' predictions incorrect. Mercury's orbit was affected by the curvature of space-time, which was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity.

  Therefore, the correct answer is not any of the given options.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A discusses the power of negative evidence and the search for it in scientific research.
  The passage B discusses the prediction of planet's orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  A disturbing force is one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists use in deriving the predictions of a theory. 
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation: 
  None of the planets (Uranus, Neptune, or Mercury) or the sun can be considered as a disturbing force. 
  The moon is the only option among the choices that can be considered as a disturbing force, as it can have a gravitational effect on Mercury or the sun that disturb the orbit of Mercury.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, which concerns the power of negative evidence, the logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence, and the search for negative evidence. It also mentions that scientific research involves generating bold theories and searching for evidence that would disprove them.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and later the orbit of Mercury, and how auxiliary assumptions were used to make predictions. 
  A: Uranus is not an example of a disturbing force as it is the planet whose orbit was predicted.
  B: The sun is not an example of a disturbing force in the context of this passage.
  C: Neptune is not an example of a disturbing force as it is the planet discovered in the vicinity of Uranus to explain the observed orbit.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

  The author believes that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines and that this will make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. 
  Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no physical inventory, thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. 

Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: The author argues that traditional publishers may be reluctant to embrace the new digital model of publishing. They may lose their authors if they do not adjust their business practices. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. Choice A is the best answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing will eventually supplant or rival traditional publishing because of the economic efficiency and convenience for customers. 
  The author suggests that once most books have been digitized, anyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practically limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that would have been designated "out of print."
  The author argues that traditional publishers will initially be reluctant to embrace digital publishing, but they will eventually have to adjust their business models in order to compete.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
The author argues that traditional publishers will initially be reluctant to embrace digital publishing, but they will eventually have to adjust their business models in order to compete. So, it can be reasonably inferred that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
The passage argues that the economic efficiency and convenience of digital publishing will likely lead to its eventual dominance over traditional publishing. However, it also notes that established publishing houses may be reluctant to embrace the new model given their heavy investment in the infrastructure of traditional publishing.

A: The passage suggests that publishers that fail to embrace the new model may lose their authors, but it does not directly state that they will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. This is a possible inference, but not the most reasonable one.
B: The passage does not mention any threat to the spread of digital publishing from computers or handheld devices for reading text. This is not a reasonable inference.
C: The passage does not suggest that the growth of digital publishing will revitalize the book retail business. This is not a reasonable inference.
D: The passage does not suggest that any book will sell more copies if published digitally versus traditionally. This is not a reasonable inference.
E: The passage does not mention the amount of money allocated for advertising books in the context of digital publishing. This is not a reasonable inference.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in factories. 
  The digital publication of a book online involves no physical inventory, thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. 
  The author predicts that digital publishing will eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing, although it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to justify investment in book printing machines at numerous regional sites. 
  The elimination of whole categories of expense means that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
The author argues that the new digital model of publishing is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing. It would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expense means that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds.

A: The author argues that publishers who fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing may lose their authors due to the competitive pressure from upstart digital publishing firms. 
B: The author does not mention any threat to the spread of digital publishing from the widespread use of computers and handheld devices for reading text. 
C: The passage does not suggest that the growth of digital publishing will revitalize the book retail business. 
D: The author does not argue that any book will sell more copies if published digitally than if published traditionally. 
E: The author does not mention anything about the impact of digital publishing on advertising budgets of publishers.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing will eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing, and that it will make publishing less expensive. However, it will take some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to justify investment in book printing machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expense means that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product. 

Action: Answer("A") 
Inference: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive, as they will face competition from upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure, which will initially be reluctant to accede.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the digital model of publishing will eventually replace or at least rival traditional publishing, and that it will be more economically efficient and convenient for customers. The author also suggests that the elimination of physical inventory and distribution costs means that authors should be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds, and that traditional publishers will need to adjust their practices to compete with upstart digital-publishing firms in bidding for new manuscripts. The author does not make any statements regarding the use of computers or handheld devices for reading text, the revitalization of the book retail business, or the sale of copies based solely on the mode of publication.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The author argues that the digital model of publishing is likely to eventually become more economically efficient and convenient for customers than traditional publishing. As a result, the author suggests that upstart digital-publishing firms may initially have an advantage over traditional publishers and that the latter will have to adjust to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. There is no mention in the passage that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally. 

A: The author suggests that traditional publishers will have to adjust to the changing publishing landscape in order to remain competitive, but there is no statement that says that publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
B: The author argues that the capacity for instantaneous transmission and retrieval of digital text is likely to lead to the displacement of printed books, but there is no suggestion in the passage that the primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers and handheld devices for reading text.
C: The author argues that digital publishing will eliminate many of the costs associated with traditional publishing, including the costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying, and returning unsold books. However, there is no statement that suggests that the growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
D: There is no statement that suggests that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally.
E: There is no statement that suggests that digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

He did not believe that art should be useful or serve any particular political view, and the formal aspects of a work were of primary importance.
  A: This statement is incorrect as although Dostoyevsky believed in the importance of the fantastic in literature, he did not suggest that it was the only requirement, nor did he agree that literature should be above the present and everyday.
  B: This statement is partially correct as Dostoyevsky believed that reality was crucial to literature, but he believed that reality was far more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the technique of discretionary nonenforcement by law enforcement agencies to reduce the costs of overinclusion (loopholes) without a corresponding increase in underinclusion. The danger of punishing the innocent is a consideration in deciding on a particular method of law enforcement. Capricious enforcement is not unknown or even rare, but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a debate in the legal community about how to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion.
  The two sides of the debate are those who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of societal norms and institutions and those who believe that committing a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice.
  An economic principle called utility maximization is introduced as a way to reconcile the two positions. It holds that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. 
  The utility maximization principle suggests that an individual will commit a crime only if the expected utility from doing so exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. 
  Increasing penalties for crimes and strengthening law enforcement can lower the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to commit a deliberate crime. Similarly, increasing the economic opportunities of those most alienated from economic institutions can increase the expected utility from lawful activity.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle and how it can be used to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  A: The scenario described does not involve the use of a principle to reconcile different positions or to make an argument.
  B: The scenario described does not involve the use of a principle to reconcile different positions or to make an argument.
  C: The scenario described does not involve the use of a principle to reconcile different positions or to make an argument.
  D: The scenario described involves the use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case, but it is not related to the use of the utility maximization principle to reconcile different positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  E: The scenario described does not involve the use of a principle to reconcile different positions or to make an argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the utility maximization principle and how it reconciles the two positions in the crime deterrence debate. The principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. The passage explains how the economic framework provided by the utility maximization principle can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. The passage also indicates that both sides of the crime deterrence debate are complementary and have the same overall effect on the utility equation.

Action: Answer("D")  
Option D is the most similar to the passage because it involves the use of evidence from another field (anthropology) to support a decision in a legal case, just as the utility maximization principle is used by legal scholars to support one side of the crime deterrence debate.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses the use of the economic principle of utility maximization to analyze crime deterrence methods, and suggests that this principle reconciles the two previously opposing views on crime deterrence. Additionally, it describes how methods suggested by both sides of the debate can lower the expected utility of committing a crime, making it less likely for an individual to do so.
A: This choice describes an astronomer using an ancient cosmologist's paradox as a metaphor to describe a recent phenomenon. This is not similar to legal scholars using the utility maximization principle.
B: This choice describes a drawing instructor using a physics law to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge are actually parallel. This is not similar to legal scholars using the utility maximization principle.
C: This choice describes a botanist using a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to discuss the competitive nature of plants in a forest. This is not similar to legal scholars using the utility maximization principle.
D: This choice describes a judge using evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. This is somewhat similar to legal scholars using economic principles to support their views on crime deterrence methods. However, the evidence used by the judge is from a different field (anthropology), whereas the scholars in the passage are using an economic principle.
E: This choice describes a mediator using a quotation from a novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at a bargaining session. This is not similar to legal scholars using the utility maximization principle.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about a debate within the legal community on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. It discusses two different positions, one that focuses on changing societal norms and institutions and the other that focuses on increasing fines and penalties and enforcing laws. The passage introduces an economic principle, the utility maximization principle, which suggests that both positions can be complementary.
  
A: This choice is not related to the passage, as it discusses an astronomer, ancient cosmologists, and a recently observed phenomenon.
B: This choice is not related to the passage, as it discusses a drawing instructor, a law of optics, and parallel lines.
C: This choice is not related to the passage, as it discusses a botanist, a legendary Olympic athlete, and plants in a forest.
D: This choice is somewhat related to the passage, as it discusses a judge and evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. However, it is not the best answer, as it does not relate directly to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
E: This choice is not related to the passage, as it discusses a mediator, a short quotation from a well-known novel, and a bargaining session.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of the economic principle of utility maximization to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime and reconcile two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the passage's discussion of the crime deterrence debate and the economic principle of utility maximization.
  B: This choice is not relevant to the passage's discussion of the crime deterrence debate and the economic principle of utility maximization.
  C: This choice is not relevant to the passage's discussion of the crime deterrence debate and the economic principle of utility maximization.
  D: This choice is not relevant to the passage's discussion of the use of the economic principle of utility maximization to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime.
  E: This choice is not relevant to the passage's discussion of the use of the economic principle of utility maximization to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the concept of utility maximization as a way to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime.
  This concept reconciles the two main positions in the crime deterrence debate by showing that both increasing penalties for crimes and strengthening law enforcement, as well as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, can effectively reduce the likelihood of committing a crime.
Action: Answer("D") 
  The passage explains how legal scholars use an economic principle, the utility maximization principle, to help solve the crime deterrence debate. Similarly, a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case would be an example of using knowledge from a different field to help solve a legal problem. Therefore, the most similar scenario to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
 The passage explains how the discovery of nuclear fission occurred. The discovery was made after a group of Italian physicists first bombarded uranium with neutrons in 1934. However, researchers were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms at that time. Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939 that scientists were actually splitting uranium atoms using neutron bombardment.
A: This information does not relate to the process of discovering the split of uranium atoms. It is discussing research techniques of the physicists.
B: Based on the passage, physicists had expectations about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products from neutron bombardment of uranium.
C: The passage mentions that theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, and this was done before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
D: The passage does not suggest that a greater number of physicists would have reduced the time taken to recognize the splitting of uranium atoms.
E: The passage does not discuss any experiments conducted in the neutron bombardment of any substance other than uranium.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission of uranium atoms.
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  The products of the neutron-bombardment experiments remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and coined the term "nuclear fission."
  
Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  The passage states that the expectation that the products of the neutron-bombardment experiments would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition was a significant barrier to recognizing nuclear fission. Therefore, if the physicists had fewer expectations about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, it would have been easier for them to realize that atoms were being split. The other choices are either not mentioned in the passage or are less likely to have helped reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split was not recognized for some time, despite compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Earlier, theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, but these experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Research related to the neutron bombardment of uranium was pursued by a group of Italian physicists, Enrico Fermi being among them.
  Lise Meitner pursued related research in Berlin, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Late in 1938, Otto Hahn wrote to Meitner of a surprising result - one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. 
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. 
  Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with physicist Otto Frisch. 
  When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link. 

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  From the information in the passage, it can be inferred that physicists had an expectation that the by-products of the neutron bombardment of uranium would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. This significantly hampered the identification of the by-products of the experiments, because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials. Therefore, it is most likely that if the physicists had not had particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they would have been able to recognize the significance of the data earlier and realize that atoms were being split. Thus, the correct answer is B.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The discovery of nuclear fission was a result of neutron bombardment experiments on uranium.
  Physicists had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with physicist Otto Frisch.
  It became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
A: The passage does not mention whether the use of the same research techniques affected the speed of discovering the atomic nucleus.
B: The physicists had expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. This expectation hindered the identification of the by-products.
C: Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. So, the physicists conducting the experiments would have been aware of these calculations.
D: There is no evidence in the passage that increasing the number of physicists would have reduced the time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
E: The passage does not mention any experiments conducted on substances other than uranium.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of uranium to achieve nuclear fission.
  Researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The products remained unidentified, partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  In 1939, Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, recognizing that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The passage states that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated. Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had been aware of these calculations, they might have realized that they were splitting atoms sooner.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The discovery of nuclear fission was a gradual process, and it took several years to recognize the significance of the data.
  Theories and expectations held by the researchers affected their ability to recognize and interpret their experimental results.
A: The fact that the physicists were using the same research techniques would not have had a significant impact on their ability to recognize the significance of their data. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
B: The choice suggests that the physicists did not have preconceived expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. This could have led them to consider alternative explanations for their results and recognize the significance of nuclear fission more quickly. Therefore, this choice is a plausible answer.
C: The physicists had already produced calculations indicating that in principle it would be possible to break atoms apart. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
D: While obtaining more experimental results might have helped, the problem was not a lack of data, but rather a lack of conceptual understanding of what the data meant. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
E: Conducting experiments on substances other than uranium would not have provided the data necessary to recognize nuclear fission. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:

  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing. Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. 
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations. She co-authored a paper with Frisch and submitted her conclusion.

A: The passage does not provide information about whether the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques. This choice is not relevant to the reduction of the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
B: The passage indicates that the researchers had certain expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, which made it difficult to identify the products as something else. This choice is not the most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
C: This choice is clearly incorrect because the theoretical calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart existed before the neutron-bombardment experiments took place.
D: This choice is not relevant to the reduction of the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. The passage does not provide information about the number of physicists involved in the experiments or whether more physicists would have accelerated the discovery of the nuclear fission.
E: The passage does not provide information about whether physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium. This choice is not relevant to the reduction of the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?

The passage presents three positions in opposition to each other, with the third position (Dostoyevsky's) being presented as different from the first two in detail. The author explains that Dostoyevsky's view of reality goes deeper than the view of the radical critics, and that he believed in the importance of the fantastic, which was not superfluous to a writer's concerns. The passage also explains Dostoyevsky's belief that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit rather than its utility. Overall, the passage focuses on presenting and differentiating Dostoyevsky's position from the other two. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism during the time of Dostoyevsky. 
  The first position believed that art should stand above the present and the everyday. 
  The second position believed that art should find its sources in concrete reality and contribute to the creation of a new society.
  The third position, held by Dostoyevsky, believed that reality was literature's crucial source and that reality went beyond the tangible. He believed that the fantastic was not superfluous to a writer's concerns and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. He also believed that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage presents three positions on the role of literature and art: one that views art as separate from the present and everyday, one that views art as a means of exposing want and injustice, and one that views reality as crucial to literature but believes that reality is not limited to the tangible and that the fantastic is intimately bound up with it. The focus of the passage is on the third position, as the author explains Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality and artistic merit. Therefore, the correct answer is that three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how evolutionary psychology examines human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution and how apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. 
  Passage B considers evolutionary psychology to be a conspiracy theory that attributes hidden interests to explain behavior. 
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: In passage A, the statement "genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" best exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory." The statement suggests that seemingly altruistic behavior may actually be motivated by an underlying self-interest in promoting gene propagation, even if the individual exhibiting the behavior is not aware of it. This idea of genes operating through instinctive actions that appear unselfish is an example of the kind of hidden interest that passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing to behavior.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and how it seeks to explain human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint.
  Passage B criticizes some of the claims made by evolutionary psychology and calls it a "conspiracy theory".
  The question asks which assertion from Passage A exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Action: Answer("D") 
The assertion from Passage A that best exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is that "genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" (Choice D). This is because the idea of genes promoting their own propagation through unselfish actions could be seen as a hidden motive that is not openly acknowledged or understood by the individual exhibiting the behavior - similar to a conspiracy theory. Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing hidden motives to behavior that may not be solely responsible for the behavior.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes the theory of evolutionary psychology and how it explains the evolution of altruistic behavior through genes promoting their own self-propagation.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" that imputes an interest (gene proliferation) to behavior that the agent is not aware of or does not acknowledge.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: In passage A, it is stated that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, like a mother rushing to help her injured child. This assertion exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it implies that behavior is determined by hidden motives (i.e., the proliferation of genes) rather than being driven by conscious choices or intentions.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes how evolutionary psychology examines human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint, explaining the evolution of certain behaviors as ways of promoting the self-propagation of genes. The passage suggests that some behaviors that appear altruistic may in fact be guided by genes that appear to be "selfish".
  Passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory because it is imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) to an agent of behavior who is not aware of it. The passage argues that there are often other interests that explain a given behavior, and that it is difficult to show that a particular interest is the only explanation for a particular behavior.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A presents the view of evolutionary psychology that behavior can be explained by examining how it contributes to reproductive success, and that seemingly altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing an interest in the proliferation of genes to explain behavior that the agent is not consciously aware of.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes the theory of evolution as a framework for examining human behavior.
  The problem of altruism is presented and explained by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior.  
  Genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory that explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
  The reason for claiming evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory is that there are usually all sorts of interests that could explain any given behavior. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolution and how it relates to human behavior, particularly the evolution of altruism. It mentions that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology, calling it a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by imputing interests that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of. It argues that there are usually multiple interests that could explain any given behavior, and that it is rare for a particular interest to be the only reasonable explanation for a behavior.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and how it explains human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing hidden interests to explain behavior.
  The question asks which assertion from Passage A exemplifies this criticism.
  A: This assertion describes the method of evolutionary psychology but does not exemplify the criticism in Passage B.
  B: This assertion discusses the difficulty of explaining altruism but does not exemplify the criticism in Passage B.
  C: This assertion describes what altruism is but does not exemplify the criticism in Passage B.
  D: This assertion suggests that genes may be conspiring to promote their own self-propagation by making individuals exhibit unselfish behavior, which exemplifies the criticism in Passage B.
  E: This assertion describes the social structure of early humans but does not exemplify the criticism in Passage B.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolution and how it contributes to the evolution of certain types of human behavior, including altruistic behavior.
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it explains human behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
  A: This choice introduces the topic of passage A but does not exemplify what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
  B: This choice discusses the problem of altruism and how it relates to evolutionary psychology but does not exemplify what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.
  C: It forms part of a speculative hypothesis that the author presents for its interest in relation to the main topic rather than as part of an argument.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.

  The passage discusses the concerns about the restrictions on access to research materials such as cell lines, genetic sequences, etc. due to patenting of biological materials used for basic, noncommercial research. The passage suggests that patents will not necessarily impede basic research but may actually spur it by providing an incentive to innovate. It also suggests that it is unlikely that a patent would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. The author also argues that, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and non-commercial research, is questionable. There has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. 
A: The author argues that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate, so it is unlikely that the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use, as this would discourage research.
B: The author argues that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher conducting basic and non-commercial research is questionable. Moreover, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Thus, it is unlikely that the corporation holding the patent will successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
C: There is no indication that the university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent. 
D: The author argues that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher conducting basic and non-commercial research is questionable. Moreover, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Thus, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
E: There is no indication in the passage that the corporation will offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage suggests that some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. However, the author argues that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. Patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Additionally, patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate because they bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the arguments for and against patenting biological materials in biotechnology research.
  The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals.
  The author argues that patenting biological materials will not necessarily restrict access to the materials and that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the concerns about the restrictions on access to research materials due to patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions. The passage further argues that the fears that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement are not valid. Patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Moreover, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
Action: Answer("D")  
The author predicts that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the debate around biotechnology patenting and the perceived threat to basic research. It argues that granting a patent does not necessarily imply the right to deny access and that patents may actually spur basic research. The passage suggests that it is unlikely for a patent to be enforced against a researcher conducting basic and noncommercial research.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The author predicts that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match

  Passage B discusses the lack of objective standards for evaluating whether fingerprints "match." The author asserts that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that local practices vary. The author notes that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. The author also discusses the lack of systematic study of the error rate for fingerprint identification and cites a study showing a 34% rate of erroneous identification.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and has long been considered reliable, though further testing and development of more consistent standards may be desirable. The author believes that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review, with examiners regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements. The author sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. The author questions the likelihood that two people could have a given number of identifying characteristics in common, the odds that two partial prints from different people will match, and the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for a long time, and experts have concurred about its reliability. The defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. The court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. Uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its discretion in crediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. Fingerprint examiners lack a generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. A more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Action: Answer("C")

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The main point of the passage is that researchers have discovered a unique type of pathogen called prions that are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material, and that these prions are responsible for causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and possibly other degenerative neurological conditions. Therefore, the answer is B. Although other options mention prions and their characteristics, they do not accurately express the main point of the passage.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage is primarily focused on the discovery of prions and their unique ability to reproduce themselves without genetic material, leading to the development of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The passage discusses the symptoms of CJD, the process by which prions reproduce themselves, the lack of immune response to prions, and the fatal nature of CJD. The passage also mentions the initial skepticism surrounding the discovery of prions, as well as the possibility that protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions. However, the main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens that are uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The main point of the passage is to describe the discovery of a deadly class of protein pathogens, called prions, that are uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material and are responsible for CJD. Option B correctly summarizes the main idea of the passage. Option A is incorrect because it only mentions one aspect of the passage and is not the main point. Option C is incorrect because it is not supported by the passage. Option D is incorrect because it only mentions the skepticism surrounding the discovery of prions and does not capture the main idea of the passage. Option E is partially correct, but it does not capture the full extent of the main point of the passage as described in option B.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage discusses the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen that is responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and is capable of reproducing itself without genetic material. The main point of the passage is the discovery of this new class of infectious pathogens that pose a unique challenge to medical research and the scientific community. Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on protein replication in general without specifically addressing the discovery of prions. Choice C is incorrect because it goes beyond the scope of the passage and makes a speculative claim that has yet to be fully explored. Choice D is incorrect because it describes a past reaction to the discovery of prions, rather than focusing on the main point of the passage. Choice E is similar to choice B but does not accurately reflect the emphasis placed on the discovery of prions and the unique challenges they pose.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has led to the discovery of a new class of pathogens, prions, which are proteins that can reproduce themselves without genetic material and are believed to be responsible for CJD. The passage also notes that prions may be involved in other neurological conditions, and that the mechanisms by which they reproduce and cause cellular destruction are not yet completely understood. Choice A is incorrect, as it focuses on the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules reproduce themselves, rather than on the discovery of prions as a new type of pathogen. Choice C is incorrect, as while the passage notes the possibility that prions may be involved in other neurological conditions, it does not suggest that they are responsible for most such conditions. Choice D is incorrect, as the passage notes that the discovery of prions was initially met with skepticism but subsequent research has supported the conclusion that they are a new type of pathogen. Choice E is a partial restatement of the main point of the passage, and is less accurate than choice B which more accurately summarizes the main point.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage describes how prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens that can reproduce themselves without genetic material, a unique ability that was discovered during research into the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Option A is incorrect because it talks about protein molecules in general, and the passage focuses specifically on prions. Option C is incorrect because the passage only mentions the possibility of prions being involved in other conditions, but there is no evidence yet to support this. Option D is incorrect because while the discovery of prions caused initial skepticism, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are a new type of pathogen. Option E accurately describes the discovery of prions and their ability to reproduce themselves without genetic material, but it doesn't capture the main point of the passage as well as option B, which specifically ties prions to CJD and describes them as a unique type of pathogen.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The main point of the passage is that research into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has led to the identification of a new class of protein pathogens called prions, which are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. The passage describes how prions cause CJD and what makes them different from other pathogens, and also suggests that prions may be responsible for other degenerative neurological conditions. Therefore, the best answer is B. A is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the mechanisms by which proteins reproduce in general. C is incorrect because the passage only suggests that prions may be responsible for other conditions, but it does not say that they are responsible for most neurological conditions. D is incorrect because the passage states that the discovery of prions initially met with skepticism but subsequent research has supported their existence. E is similar to B, but it is not as comprehensive.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage discusses research into the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which has led to the discovery of a new class of protein pathogens called prions. These prions are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material, and their unique properties were initially met with skepticism by the scientific community. The passage also mentions that prions may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions, though this possibility has yet to be fully explored. Therefore, choice B, which accurately summarizes the main point of the passage, is the correct answer.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The main point of the passage is the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen, as the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and their unique capability of reproducing themselves without genetic material. Choice (B) accurately expresses this main point. While the passage does mention other topics such as the symptoms of CJD and the possibility of protein malformation being involved in other neurological conditions, they are not the main point of the passage.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. The passage discusses the discovery of prions, their ability to reproduce and cause disease, and their differences from other pathogens. While the passage briefly mentions that prions may be involved in other neurological conditions, this is not the main point. Similarly, the passage does not focus on the lack of understanding about the mechanism of prion reproduction, nor does it discuss skepticism in the scientific community.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use
  D: detectable using brain scans enhanced by means of the subtractive method
  E: features of a general mental activity that is spread throughout the brain

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Passage A argues that a person's behavior is caused only by the operations of their brain and that the law should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution. It suggests that a person who believes they are making a free and rational choice may actually be deluding themselves, and that punishing bad people because of their freely chosen immoral acts is not a good justification for punishment. Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism, arguing that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely, as long as their actions are not constrained. Passage B does not mention self-delusion or moral responsibility. Passage A does not discuss the concept of free will and determinism. Therefore, the answer is B: free choice. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution and focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the compatibility of free will and determinism, arguing that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  A: Mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B as an example of a condition that can constrain actions, but it is not specifically mentioned in Passage A.
  B: Free choice is a key concept in Passage B, which argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is also mentioned in Passage A, which suggests that people may be deluding themselves when they believe they are making a free and rational choice.
  C: Causality is discussed in both passages, as they both address the relationship between the brain and behavior and the question of whether behavior is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will.
  D: Self-delusion is mentioned in Passage A, which suggests that people may be deluding themselves when they believe they are making a free and rational choice. It is not specifically mentioned in Passage B.
  E: Moral responsibility is mentioned in Passage A, which argues that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution as a justification of punishment. It is not specifically mentioned in Passage B.

  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
A: mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B as an example of a condition that can cause constrained actions.
B: free choice is mentioned in both passages as a concept that is central to their arguments.
C: causality is mentioned in both passages as they both discuss how the brain causes behavior.
D: self-delusion is mentioned in Passage A as something that can occur when people believe they are making free and rational moral choices but are actually being influenced by emotional centers in their brain.
E: moral responsibility is mentioned in Passage A as the dominant justification of punishment that the law should abandon.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A: The argument is that according to neuroscience, a person's behavior is caused by the operations of their brain. This challenges the idea that immoral acts are freely chosen and suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harm instead of punishment.
  Passage B: The argument is that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism, and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. Mental disorders are used as an example of a situation where a person's actions may be constrained.external sources preclude doing so.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that a neuroscientist would view human behavior as being caused by the operations of the brain.
  This view suggests that people may not be making free or rational choices and that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harm.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in the context of determinism, arguing that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Ayer argues that the source of the cause, not just the existence of a cause, determines whether an action is free.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A focuses on the idea that free choice might be an illusion created by the operations of the brain and argues for the abandonment of retribution as a justification for punishment.
  Passage B discusses the possibility of reconciling free will with determinism through the distinction between free and constrained actions.
  A: Mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B, but it is not a significant concept in the argument of Passage B.
  B: Free choice is a significant concept in both passages, but it is more directly discussed in Passage B.
  C: Causality is a significant concept in both passages, and it is directly discussed in both.
  D: Self-delusion is a significant concept in Passage A, but it is not mentioned in Passage B.
  E: Moral responsibility is a significant concept in Passage A, but it is not directly discussed in Passage B.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that an individual's behavior is caused by the operations of their brain, and that people may have a false sense of free and rational moral choice.
  Passage A proposes that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than on retribution.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will, and proposes a theory of "soft determinism" where actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Passage B does not explicitly discuss the criminal-justice system.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A suggests that the operations of the brain may be responsible for behavior, and that people may not have as much free will as they think. It recommends that the law should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism, and argues that actions are free if they are not constrained. It also introduces the idea that actions and wills that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained and therefore free.

Action: Answer("A")  
The concept of mental disorder is discussed in Passage B, but not in Passage A.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that people's behavior is caused only by their brain and that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms, rather than punishing people for their immoral acts.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism, and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.
A: mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B as an example of a condition that can cause constrained actions, but it is not a concept that plays a role exclusively in Passage B.
B: free choice is mentioned in both passages, but it is a central concept in Passage A, which argues that people may be deluded into thinking they make free moral choices, while in Passage B it is used to define free actions.
C: causality is a central concept in both passages.
D: self-delusion is mentioned in Passage A as a possibility, but it is not a concept that plays a role exclusively in Passage B.
E: moral responsibility is mentioned in Passage A as a concept that should be abandoned in the criminal-justice system, while in Passage B it is not mentioned explicitly.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how Lichtenstein's work helped to define pop art and how it conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. It also explains that Lichtenstein's work rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and displayed an impulse toward realism.
  A: This statement, though interesting, does not affect the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
  B: This statement does not affect the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
  C: This statement does not affect the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
  D: This statement does not affect the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
  E: This statement could challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein if it suggested that Lichtenstein believed that paintings void of emotions were superior to those that conveyed emotions. However, the statement only suggests that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion, so it does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

Explanation: If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting, it would challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein and his work as being a rebellion against abstract expressionism and having a deliberate naivete that was not jaded or cynical about consumer culture.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Roy Lichtenstein's work as an artist and his contribution to the pop art movement.
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein's work as merging popular culture with fine art, conveying a serious theme, and displaying an urge to depict contemporary life. It also notes that his work exudes a deliberate naivete and a sense of reconciliation between cartoons and fine art.
  
Analysis:
  The question asks which statement would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, so we need to look for an option that contradicts the main points made about his work in the passage. 
  Option A doesn't necessarily contradict the points made in the passage. Lichtenstein attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters doesn't negate his contributions to the pop art movement or the characterization of his work made in the passage.
  Option B suggests that Lichtenstein praised an abstract expressionist painter for producing an emotional painting. This doesn't necessarily challenge the characterization of Lichtenstein's work in the passage, as it doesn't contradict his own work's emotional depth.
  Option C suggests that Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings. Similar to option B, this doesn't necessarily challenge the characterization of Lichtenstein's own work.
  Option D suggests that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist for producing emotional paintings. This doesn't necessarily challenge the characterization of Lichtenstein's own work, as his work was characterized as conveying serious themes and displaying a sense of reconciliation, not necessarily being void of emotion.
  Option E suggests that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion. This also doesn't necessarily challenge the characterization of Lichtenstein's own work, as his work was characterized as displaying an urge to depict contemporary life and a deliberate naivete, not necessarily being void of emotion.
  
Answer: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Roy Lichtenstein's work and its place in the history of art.
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a complex merger of fine art with popular genres, and as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work displays an impulse toward realism and a deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication.
  
A: Lichtenstein attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s is not directly related to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
B: Lichtenstein praising a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting is not related to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
C: Lichtenstein praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings is not related to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
D: Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings is not related to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
E: Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion might challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. However, since the author describes Lichtenstein's work as having a deliberate naivete and an impulse toward realism, it is unlikely that Lichtenstein would have criticized a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes Roy Lichtenstein's work as a merger of comic book style with fine art, which conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. The passage also states that Lichtenstein's work rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and that his paintings displayed an impulse towards realism and a kind of deliberate naivete. Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. Thus, any statement that contradicts or challenges these points in the passage would contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Lichtenstein's work as part of a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, and as possessing both reflective and realist qualities. The passage also characterizes Lichtenstein's work as displaying a deliberate naivete and an inner sweetness.
A: This statement might suggest that Lichtenstein was influenced by abstract expressionism, but it does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
B: This statement might suggest that Lichtenstein appreciated emotional paintings by some abstract expressionists, but it does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
C: This statement might suggest that Lichtenstein appreciated emotional paintings by some abstract expressionists, but it does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
D: This statement might suggest that Lichtenstein criticized emotional paintings by some pop artists, but it does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
E: This statement might suggest that Lichtenstein criticized paintings for being void of emotion, but it does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a complex result that manages to convey a seriousness of theme that enables it to transcend mere parody. Lichtenstein's images were fine art, and the stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. His work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics—typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art but between parody and true feeling.

A: If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, this does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

B: If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting, this does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 

C: If Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, this does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

D: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, this does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

E: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, this may challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein because the author describes his work as having an impulse toward realism that reflects the culture Lichtenstein inhabited and that gives his paintings an inner sweetness. However, the passage does not indicate that Lichtenstein criticized any pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion. 

Action: Answer("E")

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The author of Passage A argues that insider-trading law should allow trading based on information that many others don’t have, as long as it is not obtained from a special position within a company.
  - The author of Passage B argues that insider-trading should be prohibited because it unfairly compromises the market, causing a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author of Passage A argues that insider trading based on information that is not available to the public is beneficial to the stock market, as it helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. 
  The author of Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the stock market, which is essential for its proper functioning. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Passage A argues that insider trading law, as currently framed, goes too far, and that it is important for stock markets to have accurate information spread as widely as possible. The author suggests that the concept of "insider nontrading" is more widespread and less controversial; this is the idea that insiders choose not to make trades based on information they possess. Passage B takes a different view, arguing that transparency is fundamental to a fair and equitable stock market, and that insider trading undermines investor confidence. 

Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading law should allow insiders to trade on information that is not exclusive to them, whereas Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and puts the market at risk.
  A: This law would require information that underlies trades to be shared by everyone, which is more in line with the position articulated in Passage A. 
  B: This law would permit insiders to trade based on information gained through analysis of a stock, which is also in line with the position articulated in Passage A.
  C: This law would prohibit trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is in line with the position articulated in Passage B.
  D: This law would legalize selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not related to either position.
  E: This law would legalize trading based on inside information, which is contrary to the position articulated in Passage B and to some extent in Passage A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law is sometimes too broad and can penalize those who have done their homework and are using information that everyone else doesn't have to make a stock transaction. It suggests that the stock market works best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible, but it also acknowledges that insider trading can be very harmful to the stock market if it undermines its transparency and fairness. 
  Passage B argues that insider trading is harmful to the stock market because it gives an unfair advantage to some investors, compromises the market's transparency, and undermines investor confidence. It suggests that the basic principle of a functioning stock market is transparency, which means that everyone should have access to the same information at the same time. 
  A: This law would prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which would be closer to the position taken by the author of Passage B, who emphasizes the importance of transparency in the stock market. However, it would not conform to the position taken by the author of Passage A, who argues that trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have is not necessarily harmful to the stock market and should not be criminalized.
  B: This law would permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, which would conform to the position taken by the author of Passage A, who argues that doing homework and using information to profit is not criminal. However, it would not conform to the position taken by the author of Passage B, who argues that insider trading can give an unfair advantage to some investors and compromise the market's transparency.
  C: This law would prohibit trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which would conform to both passages' positions on the harmful effects of insider trading on the stock market. However, it is not specific enough to capture the nuances of the authors' arguments about the benefits and drawbacks of insider trading.
  D: This law would legalize selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which would not conform to either author's position since it would still allow insider trading to some extent and make a distinction between buying and selling based on inside information that is not clearly justified.
  E: This law would legalize trading based on inside information as long as it is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means, which would conform to the position taken by the author of Passage A, who argues that trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have is not necessarily harmful to the stock market and should not be criminalized. However, it would not conform to the position taken by the author of Passage B, who argues that insider trading can give an unfair advantage to some investors and compromise the market's transparency.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The author of Passage A is arguing that insider-trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
  The author of Passage A is suggesting that allowing people to act on accurate information will help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  The author of Passage B is arguing that insider-trading undermines the transparency of the stock market and unfairly compromises the market.
  The author of Passage B is suggesting that insider trading can undermine investor confidence and could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider trading can help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts, and that "insider nontrading" is also widespread and acceptable.
  Passage B argues that insider trading compromises the transparency of the market, undermines investor confidence, and ultimately destroys the market. It advocates for a transparent market where information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that a certain type of insider-trading law that punishes trading on information that others don't have is wrong, as it is based on the idea that all the information about a company ought to be shared as widely as possible, and that stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about a company. The author argues that this type of information is what drives the stock market and that it is good for everyone in the stock market. The author also argues that insider nontrading is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so, and that no one would think to lock someone up for it.
  Passage B argues that the stock market is based on the principle of transparency, which means that information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market and investor confidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Passage A argues that insider trading laws are too restrictive and that the stock market works best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. The author argues that selling a stock because you know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping, which is good for everyone in the stock market. Passage B argues that insider trading compromises the market's transparency and undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market. The author argues that successful investing should be based on individual merit and skill, not access to inside information. 

Therefore, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of Passage A but not by the author of Passage B would be:

Action: Answer("B") 
Choice B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This is consistent with Passage A's argument that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible, while also prohibiting the use of insider information obtained from one's position within a company, which Passage B argues undermines investor confidence.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author of Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that one has gained from analysis of a stock, but only trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The author of Passage B argues that insider-trading laws are necessary to maintain a transparent market, and that allowing anyone to trade on inside information would unfairly compromise the market and undermine investor confidence.
A: This law would prohibit all trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, including trading based on analysis of a stock. This position is not in line with the argument presented in Passage A.
B: This law would permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This position is in line with the argument presented in Passage A and is different from the argument presented in Passage B.
C: This law would prohibit trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investor confidence in the stock market. While this law addresses investor confidence, it does not differentiate between trading based on analysis and trading based on inside information obtained from one's position within a company. This position is not in line with the argument presented in Passage A.
D: This law legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping, but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising. This position is not in line with the argument presented in Passage A, which argues that insider-trading laws should permit actions that help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
E: This law legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means. This position is not in line with the argument presented in Passage A, which argues that insider-trading laws should only prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone if that information is gained from analysis of a stock. The passage believes that such trading helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. Therefore, a law conforming most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not the author of passage B would be:
Action: Answer("B")  a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?

  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes how there is a contradiction between the idea of the Pin Factory (increasing returns to scale) and the Invisible Hand (competition and many competitors in each industry) in economic theory. It explains how the economics of diminishing returns, which is easier to represent mathematically, dominated economic theory for almost two centuries and the Pin Factory was de-emphasized. However, recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously and have surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Hence, the correct answer is E.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

The main point of the passage is that until recently, mainstream economics failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries, which creates a tension with the concept of the Invisible Hand of free markets. The passage describes how Adam Smith's "Pin Factory" example emphasized the benefits of specialization and increasing returns to scale, but the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries because it was easier to represent mathematically. Only since the late 1970s have economists found ways to model increasing returns to scale rigorously, allowing this concept to surface into the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the most accurate statement of the main point is expressed in choice E.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory, where the Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale and the Invisible Hand represents diminishing returns to scale. The passage explains that mainstream economic thought had previously emphasized the concept of diminishing returns because it was easier to describe mathematically, while the Pin Factory was seen as a fringe idea. However, recent developments have allowed the Pin Factory to be incorporated into economic thought more rigorously. Therefore, the main point of this passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Thus, the correct answer is E.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage highlights the contradiction between two economic concepts - the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand - and how they are opposed to each other. The Pin Factory emphasizes increasing returns to scale, which create a natural tendency toward monopoly, while the Invisible Hand suggests that there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, and it was only since the late 1970s that the role of increasing returns surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Hence, the correct answer is E.

The Pin Factory illustrates the increasing returns to scale and the Invisible Hand explains how self-interest can serve the common good, but the two concepts are in opposition because increasing returns to scale lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly. The passage explains how the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries because it was easier to represent mathematically, but that economists have more recently found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

The main point of the passage is that until recently economists failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries, which created a contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The passage explains the struggle between these two concepts and how increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which is opposed to the idea of many competitors in each industry for the invisible hand to work properly. The passage also explains why increasing returns to scale were not accounted for in economic theory until recently, due to the difficulty of representing them mathematically. Therefore, the most accurate choice is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory, and how this contradiction arises because of increasing returns to scale. It also explains that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. The passage goes on to explain that although the Pin Factory had been recognized for centuries, it was not integrated into mainstream economic theory until recently. Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Answer (E) captures this idea precisely.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes the contradiction inherent in economic theory between the idea of increasing returns to scale (as exemplified by the Pin Factory) and the idea that a competitive market economy requires many competitors, not just a few dominant players (as exemplified by the Invisible Hand). The passage explains that the assumption of diminishing returns has dominated economic thought for almost two centuries because it can be described with elegant formalism, while the idea of increasing returns has been difficult to represent mathematically. However, recent developments in mathematics have made it possible to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to bring it into the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the most accurate summary of the passage is that economists have, until recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Hence, the correct answer is (E).
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

The main point of the passage is that for almost two centuries, economists failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries, because the concept of increasing returns was difficult to represent mathematically. The passage explains how the idea of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, but recent developments in mathematics have enabled the idea of the Pin Factory, and increasing returns more generally, to be modeled more rigorously, and for it to become more mainstream. Therefore, the most accurate choice is E.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the contradiction between two economic concepts: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The Pin Factory suggests that there are increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand relies on the idea that there must be many competitors in each industry. The main point of the passage is that until the late 1970s, mainstream economic thought did not account for the increasing returns to scale that characterize many industries, and that this was due in part to the difficulty of mathematically representing increasing returns. Therefore, answer choice E most accurately expresses the main point of the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A suggests that insider trading provides an advantage to the trader but can ultimately benefit the entire stock market by helping to provide more accurate assessments of all relevant information.
  Passage B suggests that insider trading undermines the transparency of the stock market, which is necessary for a functioning and fair market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider trading can actually help to spread information about a company more widely, and that non-insiders also use their own specialized knowledge to make trades.
  Passage B argues that a transparent market is necessary for maintaining investor confidence and ultimately ensuring the success of the stock market, and that insider trading unfairly gives some investors an advantage over others.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The authors of Passage A argue that insider trading law should be reconsidered because trading based on information that nobody else has is a normal part of the stock market. They argue that such actions help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts, which is good for everyone in the stock market. They also argue that "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge-is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. The authors of Passage B, on the other hand, argue that insider trading undermines investor confidence in the stock market, which is bad for everyone. They argue that in a transparent stock market, everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. Insider trading gives some people an unfair advantage, and that can ultimately destroy the market if it undermines investor confidence. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading can be beneficial as it helps spread knowledge and ensures that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. It also argues that "insider nontrading" is a far more widespread practice than insider trading.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and compromises the market, leading to a loss of investor confidence and ultimately destroying the market. It contends that success in the market should be based on individual merit and skill, not on inside information.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should be balanced against the need for accurate stock information and that insider nontrading is a similarly widespread and acceptable practice.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and that transparency is necessary in a functioning stock market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A suggests that insider trading is not always a bad thing and actually helps in ensuring accurate assessment of all the relevant facts about a company, which is good for everyone in the stock market.
  Passage B argues that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market, and that a transparent market, where all information is available to all market participants at the same time, is the best way to ensure equal opportunities and success based on individual merit and skill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law criminalizes something that is a natural part of a functioning market, and that insider trading can actually help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. Passage A also argues that "insider nontrading" is a far more widespread practice that would not be penalized by law but has a similar effect on the market.
  Passage B argues that the stock market should be transparent, so that all participants have the same chance of making good investment decisions and success is based on individual merit and skill. It also argues that insider trading undermines the fairness of the market and could ultimately destroy investor confidence and the market itself. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company.
  Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time.
  In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: Both passages agree that stock markets work best when relevant information is spread as widely as possible. However, Passage A argues that insider trading can help spread accurate information and ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts, whereas Passage B asserts that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market, which could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions. Therefore, the authors would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Insider trading involves making stock transactions based on non-public information, which gives an unfair advantage to the insider.
  The first passage argues that insider trading can be beneficial for the stock market because it helps spread information, but it also mentions "insider nontrading" as a more widespread practice that should not be criminalized.
  The second passage argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market, and insider trading undermines the market by giving an unfair advantage to some investors.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading is a necessary aspect of stock markets because it helps spread knowledge and ensures stock prices reflect accurate assessments of all relevant facts. 
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence in the stock market, which ultimately leads to adverse financial repercussions. It contends that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market and that everyone should have access to the same information.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.

  E: Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the pioneering work of Katherine Dunham in the fields of dance ethnology and choreography. Specifically, the passage suggests that Dunham's success in the latter field was due in part to her training in the former field, which allowed her to incorporate traditional dance techniques from various cultures into North American ballet. The passage also suggests that Dunham's approach to research differed from prevailing methodological norms in anthropology at the time, in that she generally participated directly in the dances she was observing and analyzing.
  
  A: The passage does not suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: The passage suggests the exact opposite of this statement, namely that experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research, and that Dunham's success was due to her training and expertise in both fields.
  C: The passage does not suggest that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision. Rather, the passage suggests that Dunham's approach to research, which involved direct participation in the dances she was studying, diverged from the prevailing methodology in anthropology at the time.

  A: The passage does not suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: The passage suggests the opposite - that experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research, and that Dunham's success was due to her training in both anthropology and choreography.
  C: The passage does not suggest that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision, but rather describes Dunham's research-to-performance method that she used to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance.
  D: The passage does not suggest that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: The passage does not suggest that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how dance was neglected as a field of social research because most social scientists were not trained in dance techniques and experts in dance were not trained in social research methods. 
  The prevailing methodology at the time advised detachment from the subject of research, which Dunham diverged from. 
  Dunham was successful in bringing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance due to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.

Action: Answer("B")
The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. However, this statement is not supported by the passage. Instead, the passage suggests that most social scientists at the time were not trained in dance techniques, which made it difficult for them to understand dance techniques as complex cultural practices. Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been more likely to hold the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment, as mentioned in the passage. The best answer is (C) "Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision," which reflects the prevailing view that dance was neglected as a field of social research due to a lack of understanding of dance techniques and the methodologies used at the time.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the development of Katherine Dunham's technique known as dance-isolation in North American dance.
  Dunham was an anthropologist who conducted research into traditional Caribbean dance forms and their origins in African culture.
  Dunham's success in bringing traditional techniques from those cultures into modern North American dance was due in part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the prevailing methodology of her time, and she participated in the dances she was observing in order to understand them better.
  
Action: Answer("B")
The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. This is shown in the passage's discussion of the prevailing view among colleagues in anthropology at the time, who advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing and to maintain a position of complete detachment.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the challenges of conducting research on dance as a cultural phenomenon.
  The prevailing methodology in social research in the past was to conduct studies from a position of complete detachment.
  Katherine Dunham's approach to research diverged from the prevailing methodology, and she immersed herself in the dances she was observing.
  The prevailing view, which is now recognized as unrealistic, was that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Dunham's success in bringing traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance was due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  Dunham's research-to-performance method helped to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the neglect of dance as an area of social research due to the lack of experts in dance who were trained in social research methods.
  The peers mentioned in line 22 refer to social scientists who were likely to be skeptical of dance as a legitimate area of study.
Action: Answer("B") 
The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with option B: "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them." This is because the passage mentions that previously, social scientists neglected dance as an area of research because most of them were not trained in dance and could not understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in social research. Thus, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have likely believed that social scientists who were not well-versed in dance would have difficulty obtaining reliable data about dance traditions.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The peers mentioned in line 22 refer to other social scientists who at the time did not consider dance as an area of social research. 
  The passage describes the challenges faced by Katherine Dunham, an anthropologist, in conducting research on traditional Caribbean dance forms and her success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance.
  The passage explains that Katherine Dunham's approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them."
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the neglect of dance as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. This is because most social scientists at that time were not trained in dance techniques, and the prevailing view was that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the neglect of dance as an area of social research before Katherine Dunham's involvement.
  Anthropologists advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  The methodology that prevailed at the time was that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the challenges faced by Katherine Dunham in her career as an anthropologist and choreographer, particularly her efforts to integrate traditional dance techniques from various cultures into modern North American dance. The passage also mentions the prevailing attitudes toward dance research in the field of anthropology in the 1930s, which were characterized by a lack of interest and expertise in the subject.
  
A: The passage does not suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it. Rather, the passage suggests that dance was a neglected area of social research due to a lack of interest and expertise in the subject.
B: The passage does not suggest that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. In fact, the passage describes how Dunham's success in integrating traditional dance techniques into modern North American dance was due in part to her extensive training in both anthropology and choreography.
C: The passage does not suggest that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision. Instead, the passage discusses how Dunham's approach to research diverged from prevailing attitudes at the time, emphasizing immersion and participation in the dances she was observing rather than detachment and observation from a distance.
D: The passage does not suggest that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology. Rather, the passage suggests that dance was a neglected area of social research in the 1930s due to a lack of interest and expertise in the subject.
E: The passage does not suggest that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection. Instead, the passage describes how Dunham conducted research on traditional Caribbean dance forms in order to understand their origins in African culture and learn their techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.

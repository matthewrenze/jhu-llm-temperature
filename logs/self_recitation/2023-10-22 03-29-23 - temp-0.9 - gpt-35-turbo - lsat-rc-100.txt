Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between money and happiness. 
  Passage A mentions that relative prosperity is crucial for happiness. 
  Passage B suggests that people use material wealth to show that they are prosperous because they create value, which benefits society.
  Neither passage uses the terms in any of the pairs of terms presented in the answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness. 
  Passage A describes two phenomena, habituation and rivalry, that push up the norm for wealth and income. People compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. At any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, but over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer.
  Passage B states that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. Scholars often portray wanting to have more than others as an ignoble tendency, but it is really evidence of a desire to create value.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness and the importance of people's relative prosperity and their success in creating value to their happiness.
  The authors acknowledge the phenomenon of people wanting to earn more than their neighbors and attribute it to the desire to improve their relative position.
  Passage B argues that this desire is really evidence of a desire to create value, which benefits society.

Action: Answer("D")  
Based on the information given, it seems that the authors might see a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors as having "misguided" tendencies in Passage A, since the authors discuss how people's desire to earn more than others can lead to overinvestment in material possessions at the expense of leisure and can cause people to overestimate the income they need to be happy. However, in Passage B the authors argue that the desire to earn more money than one's neighbors is really evidence of a desire to create value, which they see as "admirable". None of the other answer choices captures this contrast in how the authors might view this type of person.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A and B talk about the relationship between money, relative prosperity, and happiness.
  Passage A discusses people's tendency to compare their income with some norm, and how this norm rises along with actual income. People's relative position and how they compare to their "reference group" is crucial for happiness.
  Passage B suggests that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value, and that people use material wealth to show not just that they are prosperous, but that they are prosperous because they create value. 

Action: Answer("B")  
According to passages A and B, a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is most likely to be described as "egocentric."
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and passage B discuss the relationship between money, success, and happiness.
  The authors do not describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "altruistic".
  There is no indication that the authors consider the desire to make more money than one's neighbors as "primitive" or "insular".
  The authors do not use the terms "cosmopolitan" and "egocentric" to describe behaviors related to making more money than one's neighbors.
  Passage B suggests that people who want to make more money than their neighbors may have a desire to create value, which can benefit society.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and B discuss studies on happiness and wealth.
  The authors are exploring why people want to make more money and what brings happiness.
  Passage A discusses the phenomenon of rivalry where people compare their income to others and feel happy as long as their relative position improves. 
  Passage B suggests that wanting to create value benefits society. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A talks about the phenomenon of habituation and rivalry, which result in people comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income.
  Passage B argues that wanting to create value benefits the society. People use material wealth to show not just that they are prosperous, but that they are prosperous because they create value.  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Passage A suggests that the phenomenon of rivalry pushes up the norm, where people compare themselves to their "reference group" in order to determine their level of happiness. It implies that the authors of Passage A may view a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as misguided.
  Passage B argues that wanting to create value benefits the society and shows that the authors of Passage B may view such a person as admirable. 
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely use the terms "misguided" and "admirable", respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors. Hence, the correct answer is D.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and passage B describe research and theories that attempt to explain the relationship between wealth and happiness. 
  Passage A describes two phenomena that push up the norm of what people consider to be an acceptable standard of living: habituation and rivalry. People adjust to their increased living standards, and they compare their income to the income of others in their reference group. 
  Passage B argues that people don't necessarily want to make more money than their neighbors just to show off or to demonstrate superiority. Rather, people use material wealth to show that they are successful and have created value. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and B argue that people compare their income with some norm and that how people compare to their "reference group" is crucial for happiness. The passage also argues that people want to create value and that they use material wealth to show not just that they are prosperous but that they are prosperous because they create value.
  
  A: The terms insular and cosmopolitan refer to attitudes towards people and ideas from different cultures and backgrounds. The passages do not provide any information related to those terms.
  B: The terms altruistic and egocentric refer to attitudes towards the well-being of others versus oneself. The passages do not support the idea that people who want to make more money than their neighbors are either purely altruistic or purely egocentric.
  C: The passages do not offer clear evidence to support that wanting to make more money than one's neighbors leads to either happiness or misery.
  D: The term misguided often has a negative connotation, but the passages argue that wanting to create value is a positive trait. The term admirable, on the other hand, implies a positive judgment, and it is consistent with the idea that creating value is a desirable attribute.
  E: The term primitive has a negative connotation that is not supported by the passages. The term lucky is not relevant to the question asked.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A and Passage B describe research on the relationship between wealth and happiness, emphasizing the importance of relative prosperity. 
  Passage A describes the role of habituation and rivalry in pushing up people's norms for income and their expectations for relative income. 
  Passage B provides an alternative explanation for why people who earn more tend to be happier, suggesting that people use material wealth as a way to signal that they are successful and have created value.
Action: Answer("D")  
Based on the passages, the authors would likely view a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "misguided" in Passage A because such a desire is driven by habituation and rivalry, which push people to want more material possessions even if they don't bring lasting happiness. However, in Passage B, the authors would likely view such a person as "admirable" because the desire to create value through material wealth can benefit society.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances. Secondary substances give plants their distinctive flavors and smells. Insects play a role in many of the secondary substances found in plants, which can either attract pollinators or defend against plant-eating insects.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.

  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale and explains how it creates a natural tendency toward monopoly. It also explains that the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. Finally, it gives an example of a pin factory to illustrate the concept of increasing returns.
  
  A: This choice is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This choice is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: This choice is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D: This choice describes an industry that is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because of technological advancement. This could be an example of increasing returns to scale.
  E: This choice is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes an inherent contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand concepts. The Pin Factory describes a situation in which there are increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand concept relies on the assumption of diminishing returns to work properly. Increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry to work properly.
  A: The example is not related to returns to scale and rather involves a decrease in quality to improve productivity.
  B: The example involves a division of labor but not necessarily a relationship between the size of the colony and productivity.
  C: The example involves a way of increasing the capacity of a single building, but it does not demonstrate increasing returns to scale.
  D: The example involves advances in technology but not necessarily a relationship between the scale of the industry and productivity. 
  E: The example demonstrates increasing returns to scale because dividing an ant colony into competing colonies results in more ants overall than could have existed in one colony.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The second paragraph of the passage explains that a firm can achieve increasing returns to scale, which means that the bigger the firm, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more products can be produced per worker. This creates a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a larger business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. 
  A: A publishing house improving the productivity of editors does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: A bee colony using some bees solely to guard its nectar sources does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: A school district increasing the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D: The lobster industry catching more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because of advances in technology does not necessarily illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  E: A large ant colony dividing and producing two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale, because the more the colony grows and divides, the more ants exist than could have existed in one colony.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as the situation where larger size leads to increased efficiency and productivity, which in turn leads to lower costs and higher profits per unit.
  A: This option describes a situation where productivity is increased by reducing standards. This is the opposite of increasing returns to scale because it does not use size to increase productivity.
  B: This option describes a situation where increased size leads to more specialization and division of labor. This is similar to the pin factory example of increasing returns to scale.
  C: This option describes a situation where a school district increases the capacity of a single building using a year-round operation. While this may increase efficiency, it is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  D: This option describes a situation where technological advances lead to more efficient lobster fishing. While this may increase efficiency, it is not an example of increasing returns to scale because it does not use size to increase productivity.
  E: This option describes a situation where division and competition lead to increased overall colony size and productivity. This is similar to the pin factory example of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the concept of increasing returns to scale, where bigger firms can produce more efficiently and at a lower cost than smaller firms.
  A: This choice discusses ways to reduce the number of editors, but it does not involve increasing returns to scale.
  B: This choice discusses how a large bee colony can collect more nectar, but it does not involve increasing returns to scale in production.
  C: This choice discusses switching to year-round operation to accommodate more students. It does not discuss increasing returns to scale, where bigger firms can produce more efficiently and at a lower cost than smaller firms.
  D: This choice discusses how advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through, allowing the lobster industry as a whole to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps. This is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  E: This choice discusses how a large ant colony divides to produce two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. This is an example of economies of scale, but not necessarily increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The second paragraph describes increasing returns to scale as the idea that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. This is opposed to the idea that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  A: This option refers to reducing the number of editors, which is related to decreasing returns, not to increasing returns to scale.
  B: This option describes how bees divide work and how this allows them to collect more nectar, but it is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: This option describes how a school district increases the number of students in a building, which may lead to economies of scale, but it is not directly related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D: This option describes how advances in technology enable the lobster industry to catch more lobsters, which is related to increasing returns to scale.
  E: This option describes the production of more colonies by a large ant colony, which is related to increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The concept of increasing returns to scale is described in the second paragraph of the passage as the idea that there are increasing returns to scale; meaning the bigger a factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore, the more it can produce per worker. The idea is opposed to the concept of diminishing returns, which has dominated economic theory for two centuries.
  
  A: This scenario does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale as there are fewer editors in the publishing house.
  B: This scenario does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale since it involves the division of labor among bees, not the increasing productivity of a unit.
  C: This scenario does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale since it involves a way of accommodating more students in a single building, not the increasing productivity of a unit.
  D: This scenario does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale since it involves the use of technology, not the increasing productivity of a unit.
  E: This scenario does illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale since the original ant colony splits into two competing, eventually prosperous, colonies that each grow large enough to divide into more colonies, resulting in an increase in the total number of ants.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The concept of increasing returns to scale is described as the idea that the bigger the scale of a business or enterprise, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more products or services it can produce per worker. This idea can lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly, where bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business. However, for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. 

A: This does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale because the productivity of editors is not based on the size of the publishing house, and the example does not involve economies of scale.
B: This does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale because it is talking about how bees can divide up the work of collecting and processing nectar, but not how a larger bee colony can produce more per bee worker.
C: This does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale because it is talking about how a school district can increase the number of students it can accommodate, but not how it can increase productivity or economies of scale.
D: This illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale because advances in technology allow the lobster industry to catch more lobsters per trap and hence produce more lobsters per worker.
E: This does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale because it is talking about how a colony divides and produces more colonies, but not how the size of the colonies can lead to more productivity or economies of scale.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about the concept of increasing returns to scale and the idea that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and hence the more productive they become. But, this can create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve economies of scale, which can drive small businesses out of the industry. As a result, there must be many competitors in each industry so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  
A: The example does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
B: The example does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
C: The example does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
D: The example demonstrates increasing returns to scale because advances in technology allow the lobster industry to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps, enabling the industry to become more productive as it grows larger.
E: The example does not illustrate increasing returns to scale in the economic sense, where larger businesses can become more productive and achieve a competitive advantage over smaller businesses.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how increased size can lead to greater efficiency, through the Pin Factory example.
  The passage also explains that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  The idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  The passage explains that increasing returns can be seen in some enterprises, such as railroads.
  The passage states that economists had repeatedly failed to bring the concept of increasing returns into the mainstream of economic thought, because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough, but they finally succeeded in the late 1970s.

Action: Answer("E")  
The example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage is E, where a large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony, illustrating how increasing returns to scale can lead to growth.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that the operations of the brain cause behavior and that neuroscience changes how we think about the law. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of determinism and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience change the way we think about the law and suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
- Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will, arguing that actions can still be considered free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.

Action: Answer("B")  
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that the traditional justification of punishment (retribution) should be abandoned in favor of a focus on deterring future harms. This is motivated by recent findings in neuroscience suggesting that people may not have full control over their actions in the traditional sense. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in the context of determinism and argues that actions can be considered "free" as long as they are not constrained by external sources. The author uses the example of a disease-free brain to illustrate this point. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that because everything a person does is controlled by their brain, the concept of free will is an illusion. The criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harm rather than seeking retribution.
  Passage B discusses the coexistence of determinism and free will. Ayer’s theory of "soft determinism" argues that actions can still be considered free as long as they are not constrained, regardless of the existence of a cause. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
Passage A argues that new findings in neuroscience suggest that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution as a justification of punishment and instead focus on deterring future harms. This is because individuals may not be making free and rational moral choices, but rather their behavior is caused by the operations of their brain. 
Passage B argues that free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will, and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A explains how recent findings in neuroscience change the way we think about the law, suggesting that the law should abandon the idea of retribution and focus on deterring future harms.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works

  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky's position on literature was as a realist who believed that reality was crucial to literature. But he did not agree with the radical critiques that art must be useful to society and serve a political view. For Dostoyevsky, a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit. He defined artistry as the ability to write well and express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader has fully understood the author's thoughts. Dostoyevsky did not believe that art must at all costs be useful to people and society.
  
  A: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics and that he believed there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. Therefore, this choice does not fit as it suggests that Dostoevsky would be happy if radical critics drew a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy.
  
  B: This choice suggests that if the radical critics put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work, then Dostoyevsky's attitude towards their view would be softened. However, the author portrays Dostoyevsky's position as the opposite. Dostoyevsky believes that the formal aspects of a work are not of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear. He believes that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. Therefore, this choice is not correct.
  
  C: The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted as it is, was meaningless for Dostoyevsky, and he believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it. Therefore, acknowledging the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works would not soften Dostoyevsky's attitude towards the radical critics.
  
  D: Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit. He defined artistry as the ability to write well and express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, recognizing the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works would soften Dostoyevsky's attitude towards the radical critics.
  
  E: The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky. Therefore, explaining more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is would not soften Dostoyevsky's attitude towards the radical critics.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on literary criticism, specifically his rejection of the radical critics' view that art must be useful and serve a particular political view. 
  A: The passage does not suggest that a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy is necessary or relevant to Dostoyevsky's views.
  B: The passage presents Dostoyevsky's rejection of the utilitarian claim that formal aspects of a work are of secondary importance so long as its goal is good and its purpose is clear.
  C: The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky believes concrete reality should be eliminated from literary works.
  D: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky values artistic merit and believes that only fully realized artistic works can fulfill their goals.
  E: The passage does not suggest that the radical critics' demand for reality to be depicted as it is is relevant to Dostoyevsky's views.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position with regard to the two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during his time. 
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it. 
  Dostoyevsky defined artistry as the ability to write well and that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." 
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.
Action: Answer("D")  
Based on the knowledge, Dostoyevsky believed that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals and only then, a work can be considered artistic. Therefore, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if they recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on literature and how it should be evaluated.
  The radical critics maintained that art should be useful and have a source in concrete reality, while Dostoyevsky believed that reality was more than just tangible and that literature should explode boundaries of the real world.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit and that utilitarian claims were a contradiction in terms.
  A: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's view of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics and that he believed there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. Therefore, drawing a sharper distinction between them would likely not soften his attitude toward the radical critics' view.
  B: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that the formal aspects of a literary work were essential and that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. Therefore, putting clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects would likely not soften his attitude toward the radical critics' view.
  C: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. Therefore, acknowledging the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works would likely not soften his attitude toward the radical critics' view.
  D: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit and that utilitarian claims were a contradiction in terms. Therefore, recognizing the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works would likely soften his attitude toward the radical critics' view.
  E: The passage suggests that the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted as it is was meaningless for Dostoyevsky, and that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it. Therefore, explaining more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is would likely not soften his attitude toward the radical critics' view.

Action: Answer("B")
 
Explanation: 
Based on the passage, Dostoyevsky's attitude towards the radical critics would be most softened if they were to put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work. Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms. Therefore, if the radical critics were to put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work, their view would be closer to Dostoyevsky's. The other options are not mentioned in the passage as potential ways to soften Dostoyevsky's attitude towards the radical critics' view.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's views on the role of literature and its relation to reality and fantasy. He disagrees with the radical critics' view that literature must have a utilitarian purpose or serve a particular political view. He emphasizes that the task of the writer is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world and to create fully realized artistic works that express the author's thoughts through characters and images. He believes that reality is not limited to the tangible and that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  
A: The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be softened if they drew a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work. In fact, Dostoyevsky believes that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
B: The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be softened if they put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work. Dostoyevsky believes that fully realized artistic works can fulfill their goals, and that clarity of purpose without artistic merit is a contradiction in terms.
C: The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be softened if they acknowledged the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works. Dostoyevsky believes that reality is literature's crucial source, and that the demand that reality be depicted "as it is" is meaningless.
D: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if they recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. Dostoyevsky defines "artistry" as the ability to write well, and he believes that artistic merit is crucial to the success of a literary work.
E: The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be softened if they explained more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is. Dostoyevsky believes that this demand is meaningless, since reality is necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.

  Dostoyevsky thought that the radical critics' insistence that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society was unsatisfactory.

Action: Answer("D") 

The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky would be most softened towards the radical critics' views if they were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. This is because Dostoyevsky believed that literature should stand or fall on its "artistic merit." He considered artistry to be the ability to write well and to express thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most appreciate the radical critics who also valued artistic merit.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics who maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality. Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. Reality was shaped by the person who experienced it. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns. A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit", he explained.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.
  E: Katherine Dunham's anthropological and choreographic expertise enabled her to make contributions that altered the landscape of modern dance in North America.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of musical structure in the novel Jazz by Toni Morrison. 
  The passage compares the structure of Jazz to the jazz compositions of Duke Ellington. 
  The author discusses the way that Jazz incorporates different narrative voices. 
  The passage does not mention other novels that use the structure of non-literary arts as the basis for their form.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its similarities to the structure of jazz music in its use of individual voices within a collective narration.
  A: This is partially supported by the passage, which discusses Morrison's use of a jazz-like style in the novel.
  B: The passage does not mention African American novelists basing their work on blues music, nor does it suggest that Jazz was influenced by the blues.
  C: The passage does not make a broad claim about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists, but only discusses Jazz and its connection to jazz music.
  D: The passage does not support this claim and instead focuses on the unique structure of Jazz as it relates to jazz music.
  E: The passage does not make a comparison between African American and non-African American writers, but only discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how the structure of the narrative is analogous to the playing of a jazz hand. The novel utilizes shifts in narrative point of view to create a sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. The author suggests that Morrison has found a way to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
A: This choice is tempting because it seems to confirm the assertion made by the author. However, the author does not explicitly state that the narrator intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance, only that the narrative structure is analogous to the playing of a jazz hand. Moreover, the author is making the assertion about Toni Morrison as a writer, not about the narrator of Jazz.
B: This choice is not relevant to the discussion of the narrative structure of Jazz or the assertion made by the author in lines 11-16.
C: This choice is too generalizing and not specific to the discussion of Jazz or the assertion made by the author in lines 11-16.
D: This choice is too broad and not specific to the discussion of Jazz or the assertion made by the author in lines 11-16. While the author discusses the musical nature of Jazz, they are specifically referring to the novel's structure and narrative point of view, not whether or not any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature depending on how it is read.
E: This choice is not relevant to the discussion of the narrative structure of Jazz or the assertion made by the author in lines 11-16. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how music is intertwined with the narrative structure of the novel. 
  The author claims that no African American writer before Morrison had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel. Instead, many have used musicians and music as themes and metaphors in their writing. 
  The author also claims that Morrison achieved a sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, similar to the way in which Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind.

Action: Answer("B") 
The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in question if which one of the following were true? 
Given that the passage states that no African American writer before Morrison attempted to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel, if (B) were true and a small number of African American novelists did actually base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, then the author's claim would be called into question. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer. Neither (A), (C), (D), nor (E) contradict the author's claim in lines 11-16.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how Toni Morrison's novel Jazz is structured in a way that is analogous to the playing of a jazz ensemble, with individual character sections being set off by quotation marks to show that the narrator is allowing them to speak and perform within the fixed scope of the narrative. 
  A: This choice is consistent with the author's assertion and supports the idea that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: This choice is not directly related to the author's assertion and is not supported by the passage.
  C: This choice is too general and does not specifically relate to the author's assertion about Jazz or the use of music in literature.
  D: While this choice is somewhat related to the passage's discussion of the connection between literature and music, it does not specifically address the author's assertion or the structure of Jazz.
  E: This choice is not directly related to the author's assertion and is not supported by the passage. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel "Jazz" and how the narration of the story simulates the style of jazz performance. The author compares the structure of the novel to the playing of a jazz hand, in which individual voices are given space to improvise, but always within the framework set by the composer or narrator.

Action: Answer("B") 
According to the passage, the author is discussing the fact that no African American writer before Toni Morrison had based the structure of an entire novel on a particular musical genre, which is jazz in this case. None of the other options are supported by the passage.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about Toni Morrison's novel "Jazz" and how its structure is similar to that of a jazz ensemble, where individual voices improvise within the fixed scope of a collective narration.
  A: The assertion in lines 11-16 is about Morrison's achievement in creating a narrative structure that simulates jazz music. Whether or not the author intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration is not relevant to this assertion.
  B: The passage does not mention any earlier African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, so this choice is not relevant to the assertion in lines 11-16.
  C: The passage does not make a generalization about novels about nonliterary arts and artists. It only talks about Morrison's novel "Jazz" and its similarity to jazz music.
  D: The passage does not make a generalization about novels being musical in nature. It only talks about Morrison's novel "Jazz" and how its structure is similar to that of a jazz ensemble.
  E: The passage does not make a comparison between African American writers and non-African American writers in terms of writing novels whose plots and characters have to do with music. It only talks about Morrison's novel "Jazz" and its use of jazz music as a structuring principle.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's 1992 novel "Jazz" and how it is structured like a jazz composition, with individual character sections separated by quotation marks, similar to solo performances in a jazz ensemble. 
  A: This statement accurately reflects the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the author's assertion in lines 11-16, as it discusses a different musical genre (blues) and does not pertain to the use of music as a structuring principle for a novel.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the author's assertion in lines 11-16, as it makes a broad claim about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists and does not specifically address the use of music as a structuring principle for a novel.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the author's assertion in lines 11-16, as it is a very general statement about novels and music that does not specifically address the use of music as a structuring principle for a novel.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the author's assertion in lines 11-16, as it discusses the number of African American writers who have written about music, but does not pertain to the use of music as a structuring principle for a novel.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how Toni Morrison uses jazz as a structuring principle for her novel Jazz, and how her use of narrative technique reflects the style of jazz performance.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage describes two sides of a debate regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion. It introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, that reconciles the two positions and explains how they are complementary. The economic principle is applied to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. Therefore, the best answer is B - Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

The organization of the passage is to describe two sides of a debate and an economic principle is applied to reconcile between them. The principle of utility maximization is introduced to show that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict and that an optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. Therefore, the best answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage describes a debate between two sides on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, and then introduces an economic principle, the utility maximization principle, which shows that the two sides are not fundamentally in conflict, but rather complementary. The principle is applied to show that the two methods of deterrence have the same overall effect, and that both should be included in an optimal approach to crime deterrence. Therefore, the answer is B, "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them."
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage presents a debate between two sides on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. One side believes that changing social institutions and rehabilitating convicted criminals will reduce crime rates, while the other side believes that increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement is the best approach. However, the passage goes on to introduce the economic principle of utility maximization, which suggests that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both positions. Therefore, one of the more accurate ways to describe the organization of the passage is that two sides of a debate are described, and an economic principle is applied to decide between them. Hence, the answer is B.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage primarily describes two sides of a debate on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes and how an economic principle, utility maximization, reconciles the two positions. Thus, the best answer is B, "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them."
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage is organized around a debate concerning the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. One position is that societal factors cause such crimes and the other position is that individual choice is the primary cause. The debate is resolved through the use of an economic principle, utility maximization. This principle is used to demonstrate that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. Therefore, choice B, "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them", is the best answer.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage describes two different positions in the debate about how best to deter deliberate crime, and then introduces an economic principle (utility maximization) that shows how the two positions are actually complementary. The economic principle is then used to explain how both positions can be effective at deterring crime. Therefore, the passage is organized around the two sides of the debate and the application of an economic principle to reconcile them. Choice B is the most accurate description of the organization of the passage.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage describes the debate between two groups of legal scholars regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. These two groups are presented in the first paragraph of the passage. The second paragraph introduces a new economic principle, utility maximization, which is then used to show how the two previously opposing views are complementary. Thus, the economic principle is applied to decide between the two sides of the debate. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that the two sides of a debate are described, and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage describes two sides of a debate on how best to deter deliberate crimes and then introduces an economic principle to reconcile the two positions. This principle is then applied to demonstrate that the two strategies are complementary rather than contradictory. Therefore, choice B accurately describes the organization of the passage.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage describes a debate between two sides about how to deter deliberate crimes. One side believes that societal norms and institutions are responsible for this type of crime, while the other side believes that it is a matter of individual choice. The passage then introduces the economic principle of utility maximization to show that the two positions are complementary rather than antithetical, as increasing the cost of criminal activity and increasing the expected utility from lawful activity both decrease the likelihood of committing a deliberate crime. Therefore, the economic principle is applied to decide between the two sides of the debate, making answer choice B the most accurate description of the organization of the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts
  B: to present evidence that undermines a theory
  C: to provide examples that support an argument
  D: to contrast several different modes of expression
  E: to enumerate specific instances in which a phenomenon recurred
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")

The third paragraph provides examples that support the argument that traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history were common in the Native American cultures, and that scholars studying the autobiographies of Native Americans have overlooked these modes of expression. The paragraph illustrates how identity was not merely individual but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos, and the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events. The paragraph provides examples of how a person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as they lived them, which is seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. The paragraph also illustrates how various artifacts were used to communicate personal history, such as tattoos, decorated shields, and robes, and how a tribe would contribute to an individual's narrative not merely passively but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. So, the third paragraph presents examples that support an argument. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph describes different modes of expressing personal history, including oral expressions, dance, drama, tattoos, and other artifacts. The paragraph contrasts these forms of expression with the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.

Popper argues that scientific research involves searching for negative evidence to disprove bold theories that make testable predictions. 
  Passage B describes how scientists attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but the prediction was incorrect. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune. Later, they discovered Neptune in the precise place they calculated it should be based on the data.
  
Analysis: 
  The question asks which scientific episode is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune. In Passage B, scientists made incorrect predictions about Uranus' orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, hypothesized the existence of another planet, and later discovered it in the predicted location. So, the answer should describe a scientific episode in which scientists made incorrect predictions, hypothesized the existence of something to explain the unexpected data, and later confirmed the hypothesis.

A: Galileo's theory of tides did not involve a hypothesis about the existence of a new planet or celestial body to explain unexpected data. Incorrect predictions alone are not enough to make this answer the most analogous.
B: Hubble's discovery about Andromeda did not involve a hypothesis about the existence of a new planet or celestial body to explain unexpected data. This answer is not the most analogous.
C: Alvarez's hypothesis about the asteroid impact did involve the discovery of unexpected data, but his hypothesis did not predict the existence of something new to explain the data. Later evidence did confirm part of his hypothesis, but this answer is not the most analogous.
D: Brunhes' discovery of reversed magnetic fields also did not involve the prediction of something new to explain unexpected data. This answer is not the most analogous.
E: Pauli's hypothesis involves the prediction of a new particle to explain unexpected data, but this episode does not involve the discovery of a celestial body. Additionally, the hypothesis was confirmed when the particle was later detected, but the discovery did not involve the same kind of calculation as the discovery of Neptune. This answer is not the most analogous.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks and how it affects people's judgments about risk and government intervention.
A: The author discusses the case of mountain climbing and notes that most people believe the onus should be on the individual to protect themselves in such cases. However, the passage does not suggest that people should generally not be protected against risks incurred through dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose. In fact, the passage argues that judgments about voluntariness are often subjective and may be based on disapproval of the activity, rather than the actual level of risk involved. Therefore, it is not possible to infer that the author would agree with this statement.
B: The passage suggests that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, while laypeople care more about whether a risk is voluntarily undertaken. The author notes that judgments about voluntariness can stem from confusion and selective attention, rather than a clear understanding of the factors that underlie voluntary and involuntary risks. Therefore, it can be inferred that the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly might not be deemed irrelevant by policy experts when making decisions about air safety regulation.
C: The passage does not provide any information to support this statement, and it is not relevant to the main argument of the passage.
D: The passage argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is often based on subjective judgments that may not reflect the actual level of control individuals have over the risk. The author suggests that government regulation should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie such judgments, rather than relying on notions of voluntariness that serve as proxies for more specific considerations. Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would agree with the statement that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
E: The passage does not support this statement, and it is not relevant to the main argument of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not always clear, and that people often use this distinction to decide whether the government should regulate the risk or not. This distinction is often based on judgments that are not very useful in guiding policy decisions. The government should attempt to save as many lives as possible, subject to the resources available, without relying on the voluntary/involuntary distinction.
A: The author does not say whether skydiving serves a socially useful purpose, and they argue against using the voluntary/involuntary distinction to decide whether the government should regulate a risk or not. 
B: The author argues that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, but laypeople care whether the risk is undertaken voluntarily. 
C: The passage does not provide information to support or refute this claim.
D: The author argues that the voluntary/involuntary distinction is not always clear, and that it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. They suggest that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people have to make a particular choice to be subject to that risk, but they also argue against relying on this distinction to guide policy decisions. 
E: The passage does not make any claims about the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks and how they are perceived by laypeople and policy experts.
  A: The author does not explicitly state whether skydiving serves a socially useful purpose or not, and the passage does not provide enough information to infer the author's opinion on this matter.
  B: The passage mentions that policy experts focus on aggregate lives at stake and that laypeople care whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily, but it does not directly address the question of whether the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly is relevant to decisions about government regulation of air safety.
  C: The passage does not provide information on whether the probability of occurrence and probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers. It also does not compare airline risks to other types of risks outside of air travel.
  D: The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks, while important to laypeople, is not very useful in guiding policy decisions. Instead, the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible, subject to resource limitations. The author suggests that identifying more specific considerations can help guide policy decisions, rather than relying on notions of voluntariness or involuntariness.
  E: The passage does not support the statement that the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the concept of voluntary and involuntary risks. The author suggests that the distinction between the two is often not straightforward and can be influenced by factors beyond the individual's control. The author also argues that, in general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible.
A: The passage discusses the idea that laypeople often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. The author does not suggest that people should not be protected against risky activities that serve no socially useful purpose.
B: The passage suggests that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, while laypeople focus on whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. The author does not suggest that policy experts would find the decisions of plane crash victims to be largely irrelevant.
C: The passage does not provide any statistical information to support the claim that plane crashes pose a higher risk than other kinds of risks incurred by passengers.
D: The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is often not straightforward. The author also suggests that people's judgments about voluntariness may be influenced by factors beyond their control. The author does not suggest that a risk should be deemed voluntary only if it is incurred by making a particular choice.
E: The passage does not support the claim that natural disasters are the main category of risks that are incurred completely involuntarily.

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk and the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. 
  A: The author discusses that people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks, but the author does not necessarily suggest that dangerous activities serve no socially useful purpose. Thus, this choice is not supported.
  B: The author does not make a claim about the relevance of plane crash victims choosing to fly to decisions about air safety regulation; thus, this choice is not supported.
  C: The passage does not provide any data or comparison about the probabilities of different kinds of risks incurred by airline passengers, thus this choice is not supported.
  D: The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention and that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. The author suggests that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are subject to that risk only if they make a particular choice.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.
  B: Researchers' funding is often contingent on whether they can produce a patentable product.
  C: Researchers see no incompatibility between unfettered basic research and the granting of biotechnology patents.
  D: Researchers increasingly believe their intellectual labor is being unfairly exploited by universities that partner with for-profit corporations.
  E: Most researchers prefer a competitive model of scientific research to a communal model.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

  Molina and Rowland's research led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Action: Answer("D")  
The passage mainly argues that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer; this is because CFCs contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, which shields the earth from ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer. The passage does not provide strong support for the other statements.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) deplete the ozone layer by releasing chlorine, which then reacts with and destroys ozone molecules. 
  The depletion of the ozone layer is a pressing environmental threat that could lead to an increase in skin cancer due to the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland's research and advocacy were instrumental in bringing attention to the issue and ultimately led to the ban of CFC production through the Montreal Protocol.
A: The passage does not provide evidence to support this statement.
B: The passage does mention that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
C: The passage does not mention any other chemicals that result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere, but it also does not make a claim about the lack of other such chemicals.
D: The passage clearly supports this statement. It describes how the depletion of the ozone layer is linked to an increase in skin cancer due to increased ultraviolet radiation, and Molina and Rowland's advocacy led to the eventual ban of CFCs and other ozone-depleting gases.
E: The passage does not support this statement. It describes how CFCs diffuse upward into the stratosphere, but it does not state that this occurs mainly in Antarctica.

  The passage discusses the harmful effects of manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer.
  CFCs chemically attack and deplete ozone which affects its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation and contributes to skin cancer.
  Regular use and production of CFCs leads to the depletion of the ozone layer which continues for years even after stopping the production.
  Two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, were early advocates of policy changes to address the depletion of the ozone layer and testified before the US Congress in this regard.
  The Montreal Protocol of 1987 banned the production of ozone-depleting gases.

Action: Answer("D") 
The passage primarily discusses the consequences of the depletion of ozone by CFCs and its impact on skin cancer. While some of the other answer choices, like A and C, are mentioned in the passage, they are not supported as strongly as the link between skin cancer and ultraviolet radiation from the sun, which can penetrate the depleted ozone layer and cause harm. The passage also mentions the efforts of Molina and Rowland in advocating for public policy changes to address the depletion of the ozone layer, and how such efforts led to the Montreal Protocol, which banned the production of ozone-depleting gases. Therefore, the most strongly supported option is D, which states that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Question: The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" (lines 18-19) for which one of the following reasons?
Choices:
  A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics
  B: to illustrate the influence of religion on the historical development of art
  C: to present an example of the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist
  D: to show how an artist can subvert the ideals of the patron
  E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" (lines 18-19) to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, a member of the elite, but it was created in a way that expressed and mirrored Raphael's ideals and way of life, not necessarily the ideals of the Pope or the elite. Therefore, it is an example of an artist/patron relationship that does not fit the pattern of art being produced solely to embody the ideology of the elite. Option A is incorrect because although it mentions sociohistorical critics, it does not accurately reflect the purpose of the Raphael frescoes example. Option B is incorrect because the influence of religion on the historical development of art is not the main focus of the passage. Option C is incorrect because the passage mentions two ways that art was produced by and for political and social elites, and commissioning a well-known artist to produce something for display is only one of them. Option D is incorrect because the passage does not mention that Raphael subverted the ideals of the patron.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. Specifically, the frescoes were created to express and mirror the ideals and way of life of the patron, Pope Julius II, rather than being a reflection of the artist's own ideology. This contradicts the assumption of sociohistorical critics that art produced for political and social elites was always a means of embodying the ideology of the elite class. Therefore, the correct choice is E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments in the context of discussing the two different ways that art was produced by and for political and social elites. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments commissioned by Pope Julius II. However, the author points out that not all artist/patron relationships fit this pattern. Therefore, the author cites Raphael's frescoes to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. Hence, the correct answer is E, "to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics."
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example of art produced for political and social elites and favored by sociohistorical critics. The author specifically states that this type of art "enabled them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist" (lines 10-13). Therefore, the best answer is A.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments in order to illustrate that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The main point made in the passage is that there are two different ways that art historically was produced by and for political and social elites, and that the sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced the second way. The author then acknowledges that some of the most enduring works of art were produced in ways that do not fit this pattern, such as works that went against the grain of elite values and were paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments are an example of works that were commissioned by Pope Julius II and expressed and mirrored his ideals and way of life, but have endured despite not fitting the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
Response 6:
Answer: A
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The second way in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites" was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments commissioned by Pope Julius II. This relationship between patron and artist does not necessarily fit the pattern traditionally favored by sociohistorical critics, who prefer to deal with art produced by the second way.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

The reason why Raphael's frescoes are mentioned is to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The frescoes are cited as an example of art produced for a patron that did not necessarily reflect the patron's ideals and way of life, but instead were created to illustrate religious stories and themes. This example supports the author's argument that the relationship between a patron and an artist is not always straightforward and that sociohistorical critics' analyses can be limited by their focus on the relationship between art and the ideology of the elite. Therefore, the correct answer is E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

Explanation: 
The author mentions the frescoes by Raphael in the Vatican apartments to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics. The frescoes are an example of art created by and for political and social elites, and they embody the ideology of the elite. The author goes on to argue that for the analysis of such art to work, however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:
Lines 7-11 state that some legal scholars believe that the lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of and that the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate. Lines 28-31 argue that when lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, they should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Instead, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Analysis:
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 describes that some legal scholars argue that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation, and that lawyers have no right to judge defendants.
    The relationship between these two sentences seems to be one of contrast, as the first sentence contradicts the idea proposed by legal scholars that lawyers' only obligation is to provide the best possible legal representation.
Answer: B, the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers to provide the best defense possible to their clients while also being honest and not presenting assertions they know to be false. The passage argues that in cases where defense lawyers are absolutely certain that their clients are guilty, they should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence, as guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
The author of the passage agrees in general with the earlier position that defense lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, but disagrees over the particulars in cases where defense lawyers know with certainty that their clients are guilty. In such cases, the author argues that the lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their clients' innocence.
Response 3:
The sentence at lines 7-11 talks about the obligation of defense lawyers to provide the best defense they are capable of. The sentences at lines 28-31 talk about how lawyers should approach defending clients they believe are guilty. The two sets of sentences are related because they both discuss the role and obligations of defense lawyers. The sentences at lines 28-31 are providing clarification on the obligations of lawyers mentioned earlier. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Analysis: The sentences at lines 28–31 refer to the lawyer's duty to the court and society in addition to the defendant. The sentences at lines 7–11 discuss the obligation of defense lawyers to provide the best possible legal representation and not to judge defendants. 
Answer: D) agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars. The sentences found at lines 28-31 support the idea that defense lawyers have an obligation not only to the defendant but also to the court and society. This idea is in agreement with the earlier position that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best possible defense for the defendant. However, the later sentences suggest that defense lawyers should not take cases that they know are false or insincere, which disagrees with the idea that lawyers have no right to judge defendants.
Response 5:
The sentence at lines 7-11 talks about the obligation of defense lawyers to provide the best defense possible for their clients and not to judge the defendants. The sentences at lines 28-31 discuss the duty of lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty. These sentences relate to the earlier statement because they explain that lawyers should not try to demonstrate the innocence of clients they know are guilty. Therefore, they are expressing the same idea from a different perspective; the sentences modify the earlier statement by providing additional information about when a lawyer should not undertake to demonstrate their client's innocence. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
The two sentences at lines 28-31 state that "Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this." This contradicts the earlier position that defense lawyers should provide the best possible legal representation, regardless of their personal beliefs. Therefore, the relationship between the two sets of information can be described as disagreement over the particulars. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers and their responsibility to both their clients and the court/society.
  Lines 7-11 summarize the position of some legal scholars that defense lawyers should provide the best defense they are capable of, regardless of their personal opinions about the guilt or innocence of their clients.
  Lines 28-31 explain that defense lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their guilty clients' innocence, but instead should present extenuating circumstances and argue for leniency in sentencing.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 disagrees with the earlier position that defense lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of. Instead, it agrees with the idea that defense lawyers have an obligation to their clients, the court, and society. However, it also presents a particular case where the defense lawyer's responsibility to the court and society prevents them from presenting false claims of innocence for guilty clients. Therefore, it both agrees and disagrees with the earlier position, making choice D the best answer.
Response 8:
Knowledge: Defense lawyers have an obligation to their clients, but also to the court and society. They should not present to the court assertions they know to be false, and they should not undertake to demonstrate the innocence of a client who they know to be guilty. They should rather appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: The sentence at lines 28-31 explains the author's view that lawyers have a twofold obligation to their clients and the court and society, and that they should not deny the guilt of a client who they know is guilty. This view, however, is not in complete disagreement with the earlier lines (lines 7-11). The earlier lines argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants, and their role is to provide the best defense possible. Therefore, while there is a general agreement between the two positions, there is disagreement over the particulars.
Response 9:
The relevant information in the passage is that defense lawyers have a duty to be sincere in their representation of clients. If they know their client is guilty, they should not deny it and instead present any extenuating circumstances to argue for leniency in sentencing. 
Knowledge: 
  Lines 7-11 describe the position held by some legal scholars that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.
  Lines 28-31 state that, when lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty, they should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation.
Action: Answer("D") 
Thus, the information contained in the sentences at lines 28-31 agree with the earlier position that lawyers have an obligation to provide the best defense they can, but disagree over the particulars and emphasise the need for sincerity in representation.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?
  C: What kinds of messages and pieces of wisdom are most often communicated by proverbs in the English-language tradition?

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: The author of the passage refers to "self, life, and writing" (lines 12–13) most probably in order to
Choices:
  A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas
  B: define a word that had a different meaning for early Native Americans than it has for contemporary Native Americans

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that Native American cultures did not share the same assumptions about self, life, and writing with Europeans, which underlie the concept of European-style autobiography.
  A: This is correct; the author suggests that Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas about self, life, and writing, which underlie the concept of autobiography.
  B: This is incorrect. While the author does address how early Native Americans may have viewed the concept of self, life, and writing differently from the way contemporary Native Americans do, this is not the main point of the passage.
  C: This is incorrect. The author does not discuss how words can undergo a change in meaning after their introduction into a language.
  D: This is incorrect. The author actually describes how the assumptions underlying the concept of self, life, and writing were different in European and Native American cultures.
  E: This is incorrect. While the author does discuss how the assumptions underlying European-style autobiography arose, this is not the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the differences between European and Native American cultures and their expressions of personal history and autobiography. Pre-contact Native American cultures had different assumptions about self, life, and writing than the Europeans, which affected the way their personal histories were communicated.

A: The author does suggest that Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas about self, life, and writing. However, this is not the main purpose of referring to these concepts in this sentence.
B: The author does not imply that the word "autobiography" had a different meaning for early Native Americans.
C: The author does not suggest that the word "autobiography" underwent a change in meaning after its introduction into the English language.
D: The author does not posit a fundamental similarity in the origins of a concept in both European and Native American cultures.
Action: Answer("E") 
The author refers to "self, life, and writing" (lines 12–13) to explain how the assumptions that underlie European-style autobiography arose and how they differ from Native American cultural perspectives on expressing personal history.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the cultural constructs of pre-contact Native American peoples and their traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. It notes that scholars have focused on written, as-told-to life histories, but have overlooked oral modes of communication and the cultural differences in assumptions about self, life, and writing between Native Americans and Europeans.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The author refers to "self, life, and writing" (lines 12-13) in order to identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history among the Native American peoples and how it differs from the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. The author points out that, unlike the European mode of autobiography, which is based on the idea of the self as an individual, the expression of life experiences traditionally tended to be oriented toward current events and was markedly inclusive, with identity being relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Language, songs, chants, stories, dance and drama, tattoos, shields, robes, tepees, and other symbolic designs were all used to convey personal history. Any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas of the audience for whom it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative.

Action: Answer("A")  
The author of the passage refers to "self, life, and writing" (lines 12–13) most probably in order to identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

The author refers to "self, life, and writing" (lines 12–13) to identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas. The passage explains that Native American cultures had a different idea of the self and did not share Europeans' assumptions about life and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography. Therefore, the author argues that scholars have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples. Hence, the best answer choice is A.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the differences between traditional Native American forms of communicating personal history and the European concept of autobiography. In particular, it notes that the idea of self differed between Native American cultures and Europeans, and that pre-contact Native American cultures did not have the same assumptions about writing and the recording of life events.
A: This accurately identifies the purpose of the reference to "self, life, and writing" in the passage - it illustrates that Native Americans and Europeans had contrasting ideas about these concepts.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history among Native American peoples, which differs from European-style autobiography.
  The author contrasts the highly inclusive idea of self in some Native American cultures to the individualistic idea of self underpinning European-style autobiography.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the differences between European-style autobiography and traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history among Native Americans. European-style autobiography is rooted in the concepts of "self, life, and writing," which were not necessarily shared by Native Americans, whose expression of life experiences was oriented toward current events. Native American cultures considered identity to be not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. 

A: This is correct. The author contrasts the European concept of "self, life, and writing" with the traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history used by Native Americans. 
B: The author does not discuss how the meaning of the word "autobiography" has changed over time. 
C: The author does not discuss changes in the meaning of words in general. 
D: The author discusses the differences between European and Native American cultures' concepts of self, life, and writing, and how these differences affected the expression of life experiences. However, the author does not argue that the origins of these concepts are fundamentally similar. 
E: This is partially correct, as the author explains how the assumptions that underlie European-style autobiography differ from those that underlie traditional Native American modes of communicating personal history. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The author discusses the ways in which European and Native American cultures differ in terms of their understanding of "self, life, and writing." Early Native American cultures tended to have a more inclusive understanding of self and identity that was shaped by society, landscape, and the cosmos. Writing was not a primary mode of expression, and personal history was communicated through language, signs, and various forms of art.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted. Such scans are created by subtracting a baseline measurement (taken in a control condition) from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task. The reasoning is that the difference between these measurements represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. However, the entire brain is active in both conditions, so the subtractive method obscures the fact that cognitive tasks involve distributed brain functions. This leads to a false impression of neat functional localization.
A: This choice involves determining which district of a city was the determining factor in a mayoral election. There is no clear analogy between this and the way FMRI scans are interpreted.
B: This choice describes a situation in which a store's advertising campaign had an impact on shopper behavior, but only during the summer months. There is no clear analogy between this and the way FMRI scans are interpreted.
C: This choice describes a situation in which agricultural customers use more water than residential customers, so they are more severely impacted by droughts. There is no clear analogy between this and the way FMRI scans are interpreted.
D: This choice describes a situation in which Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours and originates primarily from homes. There is no clear analogy between this and the way FMRI scans are interpreted.
E: This choice describes how cheetahs are the fastest land animals, but only for short distances. This allows for an analogy to be made with how FMRI scans only capture the metabolic activity associated with a particular cognitive task (which may only be a "short distance" within the entire brain). The FMRI images give a false impression of neat functional localization, just as it would be a mistake to conclude that cheetahs are the fastest animals overall. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes that FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain. The method used is a subtractive method where a baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to give a map of the rate of oxygen use associated with the cognitive task in question. 
  A: This analogy is not related to the manner in which fMRI scans are typically interpreted.
  B: This analogy is not related to the manner in which fMRI scans are typically interpreted.
  C: This analogy is not related to the manner in which fMRI scans are typically interpreted.
  D: This analogy is not related to the manner in which fMRI scans are typically interpreted.
  E: This analogy is related to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the passage. Just as the cheetah is the world's fastest animal only for short distances, but not for long distances, the FMRI gives a misleading impression of modular functions by subtracting out all the distributed brain functions. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of neuroimaging, specifically FMRI scanning, as a research method in psychology to identify specific areas in the brain that are associated with certain cognitive tasks. However, the interpretation of FMRI scans is based on a subtractive method that may obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and on-task conditions. The modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions, may not accurately reflect the distributed nature of mental activity in the brain.
  
  A: This choice describes a situation where one particular district was critical in ensuring a political victory, suggesting that the importance of a specific brain region can be similarly critical in cognitive tasks. However, this choice does not align with the subtractive method used in interpreting FMRI scans or the critique of the modular theory of mind presented in the passage.
  
  B: This choice describes a situation where a yearlong advertising campaign had an impact only on summer shoppers. This choice does not provide a good analogy for how FMRI scans are interpreted, as FMRI scans are not about identifying specific time periods but rather about identifying specific brain regions responsible for certain cognitive tasks.
  
  C: This choice describes a situation where the agricultural sector is impacted more severely by droughts than the residential sector due to differences in water usage. This choice does not provide a good analogy for how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  
  D: This choice describes a situation where Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours and originates primarily from homes rather than office buildings. This choice does not provide a good analogy for how FMRI scans are interpreted or the critique of the modular theory of mind presented in the passage.
  
  E: This choice describes a situation where the cheetah is the fastest land animal only for short distances, and most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances. This choice does not provide a good analogy for how FMRI scans are interpreted or the critique of the modular theory of mind presented in the passage.

  The passage describes the interpretive method behind FMRI scans.
  The scan measures the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain, where the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  The subtractive method may not give the full context of brain activity.
  The passage does not describe analogies for the FMRI scan method.

A: This analogy is about the importance of a particular district in an election, and how it affected the outcome. This is not analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
B: This analogy is about a store's advertising campaign and its effects on shoppers during certain months. This is not analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
C: This analogy is about how water supply is used by different sectors and how droughts affect them. This is not analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
D: This analogy is about internet traffic originating from homes rather than office buildings during evening hours. This is not analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted. 
E: This analogy is about how cheetahs are the fastest land animals but they cannot outrun other land animals over long distances. This is not analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The article describes the use of FMRI scans in psychology to investigate the modular theory of mind.
  FMRI scans provide a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The results from FMRI scans are obtained through a subtraction method where a baseline measurement is taken and then subtracted from the measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The difference between the two measurements is interpreted as the metabolic activity of the cognitive task in question.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  The manner in which FMRI scans are interpreted, as described in the article, is analogous to the way in which the increase in shoppers during the summer can be attributed to the advertising campaign launched a year previously. In both cases, an effect (increase in shoppers or metabolic activity in certain brain regions) is attributed to a specific cause (advertising campaign or cognitive task) without taking into account all of the other factors (other seasons or other brain regions) that may have contributed to the observed effect.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, which is through subtractive method. This method subtracts the baseline measurement in the control condition from the measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The remaining activity is considered to be associated solely with the cognitive task in question. The entire brain is active in both conditions, but this method gives a false idea of neat functional localization.
  
A: This choice describes how a particular district's votes affected the mayoral election. It is not an appropriate analogy to FMRI scans.
B: This choice describes how a store's advertising campaign appeared to affect only summer shoppers. It is not an appropriate analogy to FMRI scans.
C: This choice describes how the impact of droughts on water supply varies between agricultural and residential customers. It is not an appropriate analogy to FMRI scans.
D: This choice describes how Internet traffic varies between different types of buildings. It is not an appropriate analogy to FMRI scans.
E: This choice describes how cheetahs are the fastest animal only for short distances. It is not an appropriate analogy to FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

  The passage describes how the use of neuroimaging in psychology rests on the validity of the modular theory of mind, which proposes that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) technique produces striking images of the brain at work. However, what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use, which is the result of subtracting a baseline measurement, taken in the control condition, from a second measurement taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task. This subtraction method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the way in which brain scans are interpreted and the potential flaws in that interpretation.
  In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted as a differential rate of oxygen use in the brain.
  The differential rate of oxygen use is obtained by subtracting a baseline measurement in a control condition from a measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The resulting differential rate of oxygen use is then interpreted as representing the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The author argues that this subtractive method of interpretation is problematic in that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  Option A is not analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as it describes a situation where a particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, which has no resemblance to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Option B is the correct answer as it describes how a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. Similarly, FMRI scans are interpreted by measuring the differential rate of oxygen use while the subject is performing a cognitive task, which subtracts the baseline measurement to determine the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  Option C is not analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as it describes the impact of droughts on agricultural customers and residential customers and has no relation to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Option D is not analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as it describes the origin of internet traffic during peak hours and has no relation to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Option E is not analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as it describes the cheetah as being the world's fastest land animal only for short distances and does not have any relation to how FMRI scans are interpreted.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The second version of multicultural education holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. Critics of this version of multicultural education argue that it is impossible to understand and appreciate non-Western cultures if one insists on approaching them solely from within the Western scientific perspective and heritage.
  
A: The answer choice is incorrect as it refers to the circumstances that give rise to a culture's values and does not address the objection discussed in the second paragraph.
B: The answer choice is not the best answer as it refers to the role of social and historical circumstances in shaping a culture's values, which is not the focus of the objection raised in the second paragraph.
C: The answer choice is not the best answer as it refers to studying a culture from more than one cultural perspective, which is not the focus of the objection raised in the second paragraph.
D: The answer choice is incorrect as it suggests that genuine understanding of another culture is only possible if that culture shares the same cultural values, which is not the argument presented in the second paragraph.
E: The answer choice is the best answer as it suggests that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science, which is consistent with the objection raised in the second paragraph.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The second version of multicultural education advocates for a neutral stance in examining and understanding different cultures, taking each culture on its own terms. However, critics contend that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value laden with Western cultural values and thus, not essentially different from the first version of multicultural education.
A: This statement is not in line with the objection discussed in the paragraph since the objection does not imply that it is impossible to understand a culture's historical and social circumstances.
B: This statement is not in line with the objection discussed in the paragraph since it is not the main point of the objection.
C: This statement is not in line with the objection discussed in the paragraph since it does not propose the need for understanding other cultures from more than one cultural perspective.
D: This statement is not in line with the objection discussed in the paragraph since it is not the main point of the objection.
E: This statement is in line with the objection discussed in the paragraph, as it argues that the methods of Western science cannot be solely relied upon to understand a culture's values. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The paragraph discusses an objection to the second version of multicultural education that argues that the Western scientific methods used to examine other cultures are already value-laden and not essentially different from the first version of multicultural education, which involves teaching other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values.
  
A: This choice is not relevant to the objection discussed in the paragraph.
B: This choice acknowledges that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can have an impact on its values, but it is not the main point of the objection discussed in the paragraph.
C: This choice is not entirely accurate since the objection discussed in the paragraph does not argue that multiple cultural perspectives are necessary to understand another culture, but rather that adopting the methods of the culture being studied is necessary for genuine understanding.
D: This choice is not accurate since the objection argues that studying other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values makes genuine understanding impossible.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The second paragraph describes an objection to the second version of multicultural education that holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The objection is that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden; to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Critics of this approach argue that it is not essentially different from the first approach, and that real understanding of another culture can only be achieved by adopting the methods and perspectives of the culture being studied.
A: This choice is incorrect because the objection discussed in the second paragraph does not argue that the social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
B: This choice is incorrect because while it is true that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values, it does not directly address the objection discussed in the second paragraph.
C: This choice is incorrect because while it is true that studying another culture from more than one perspective could be beneficial, it does not directly address the objection discussed in the second paragraph.
D: This choice is incorrect because it directly contradicts the objection discussed in the second paragraph.
E: This choice is correct because it agrees with the objection discussed in the second paragraph that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.

  The second paragraph discusses an objection to the second version of multicultural education that argues that using Western scientific methods to examine other cultures is still an expression of cultural chauvinism. Thus, the objection argues against using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures.
  A: This choice is incorrect because it suggests that members of a culture with different values cannot understand other cultures, which is not the objection raised in the second paragraph.
  B: This choice is a true statement but is not directly related to the objection raised in the second paragraph.
  C: This choice is incorrect because the objection raised in the second paragraph does not argue for the use of multiple cultural perspectives but rather a non-scientific approach to understanding non-Western cultures.
  D: This choice is incorrect because the objection does not hold that cultures must share cultural values to be understood. Rather it criticizes the use of Western scientific methods to understand other cultures.
  E: This choice correctly summarizes the objection raised in the second paragraph, which argues that using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures is not only distorting but also an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The question asks what critics of the second version of multicultural education discussed in paragraph two would be most likely to agree with. According to the paragraph, these critics argue that examining other cultures through the methods of Western science involves a commitment to certain values and that trying to understand nonscientific cultures by these methods is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. Therefore, these critics would likely believe that to achieve real understanding of another culture, one must adopt the perspectives and methods of the culture studied. 
A: This answer is not likely to be correct, as the objection discussed in paragraph two does not mention anything about the inability of members of different cultures to understand each other's values.
B: While this answer may be true, it is not directly relevant to the objection raised in paragraph two. 
C: This answer may be a possible solution to the objection discussed in paragraph two, but it is not what the critics themselves would be most likely to agree with. 
D: This answer is not likely to be correct, as the critics in paragraph two argue against the idea of examining other cultures from the perspective of one's own cultural values, rather than believing that cultures must share the same values in order to be understood. 
E: This answer is directly related to the objection discussed in paragraph two, as the critics argue that methods of Western science involve a commitment to certain values that cannot adequately understand nonscientific cultures. Therefore, this is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that adopting Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures is not adequate and could be Eurocentric.
  A: This choice is the opposite of the critics' argument, which maintains that cultural values cannot be adequately understood from outside of the culture by Western scientific methods.
  B: This choice is not directly relevant to the critics' argument, which is about the methods used to understand another culture, not the role of social and historical circumstances in shaping a culture's values.
  C: This choice is closer to the critics' argument that understanding another culture requires adopting more than one cultural perspective. But the critics' argument goes further to say the methods used to understand other cultures should not be exclusively Western.
  D: This choice is the opposite of the critics' argument. The critics argue that real understanding can be achieved by adopting the cultural perspectives and methods of the culture studied, even when those methods are not scientific.
  E: This choice is the closest to the critics' argument. The critics argue that the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures and should not be dismissed as less valuable than Western scientific methods. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The second paragraph is discussing a second version of multicultural education which advocates for a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures, but the study of cultures is still done through Western scientific methods.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
The passage talks about:
- How the chemical composition of plants gives them their characteristic smells and tastes.
- The two categories of chemical substances in plants: primary and secondary.
- The role of insects in the development of secondary substances in plants.
- The fact that secondary substances can work as defenses against insects and can be either harmful or dissuasive in nature.
- The competition between plants and insects over hundreds of millions of years has led to a narrowing of secondary substances present in plants.
- The relationship between the secondary substances of plants and the insects that feed on them.
- The association of insect species with botanically restricted groups of plants.

Answer:
Option A is incorrect because although it mentions secondary substances' role in plant defense, it ignores the evolutionary history behind them.
Option B is incorrect because it focuses on the narrowing of the range of secondary substances and insect species but misses the evolutionary process.
Option C is correct because it states that the secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Option D is incorrect because it reverses the cause and effect relationship between species relatedness and similarity in secondary substances.
Option E is incorrect because it addresses only one aspect of the passage and does not explain the evolutionary relationship between plants and insects. 

Therefore, the answer is C.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")

The main point of the passage is that the secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells are the result of an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects, which has led to the development of biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants. The passage discusses how certain secondary substances attract pollinating insects to blossoms, while others are biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects, and still others discourage insect feeding by warning them of harmful substances. The passage also notes that the evolutionary competition between plants and insects has led to the development of narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants that are suitable food sources for any one species of insect. Choice A is too narrow in scope and does not encapsulate the whole passage. Choice B only focuses on the consequence of the competition and does not describe the process that led to it. Choice D is partially correct, but the focus on the similarity between closely related species is not the main point of the passage. Choice E is a distortion of the passage, as it suggests that plants are actively competing with plant-eating insects, rather than being passive participants in an evolutionary process.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and how this relates to their tastes and smells, as well as their interactions with insects. The passage notes that there are two categories of chemical substances in plants (primary and secondary) and that it is the secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects also play a significant role in the evolution of these substances and have driven the development of both scents that attract pollinating insects and biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects. Over time, the competition between plants and insects has led to the evolution of a narrow range of secondary substances present in different plants, which result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

Analysis:
The main point of the passage is to discuss the interactions between plants and insects in the development of plant secondary substances that give plants their distinctive scents and tastes. Therefore, the best answer is choice C, which accurately expresses the idea that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus their distinctive tastes and smells, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about the relationship between plants and insects regarding the characteristic smells and tastes of plants. 
  The primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  The secondary substances are a diverse set of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  The secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
  Other secondary substances arise as biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, most of which are insects.
  Insects have the ability to identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: 
The passage discusses how the chemical composition of plants determines their taste and smell, and how this is attributed to secondary substances that have evolved over time, largely due to evolutionary pressures from insects. The secondary substances are not necessary for the plant's internal processes, but are important for their survival because they operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects. The competition between plants and insects is a long-term evolutionary process that has led to narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant. Therefore, the passage's main point describes how the evolution of secondary substances in plants is related to a process of interaction between plants and insects. Choice C is the best option that captures this main point.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is discussing the characteristics and roles of primary and secondary substances in plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that give plants their tastes and smells, and they have a range of roles that help plants survive and protect against enemies.
  Natural selection has favored secondary substances that are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms or that are biochemical defenses against insects.
  Insects have evolved to identify plants by their characteristic tastes and smells, and the competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, with a focus on primary and secondary substances.
  Secondary substances are responsible for the taste and smell of plants.
  Insects have played a role in the development of secondary substances through a process of natural selection.
  Secondary substances can serve either as biochemical defenses or as signals to attract pollinating insects.

Analysis:
  The passage discusses the role of secondary substances in plants, focusing on how these substances develop and what purpose they serve. It also describes the interaction between plants and insects in shaping the development of these substances. 
  Choice A is partially correct, but it only mentions the insect defense aspect of secondary substances, leaving out the role of insects in pollination. 
  Choice B is incorrect because it overgeneralizes the information about competition between plants and insects. 
  Choice D is incorrect because it misrepresents the relationship between the similarity of secondary substances and the relatedness of plant species. 
  Choice E mentions plant mutations but does not capture the evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the role of secondary substances in plants, how they are produced, and how they interact with insects. It also touches on the competition between plants and insects and how it has affected the evolution of both groups.
  
A: This answer choice accurately describes the role of secondary substances in plants, but it does not capture the broader point of the passage, which discusses the interaction between plants and insects and how it has shaped the evolution of both groups.

B: This answer choice accurately describes the narrowing effect that competition between plants and insects has had on secondary substances and insect diets, but it does not capture the broader point of the passage, which is the evolutionary interaction between plants and insects.

C: This answer choice accurately describes the main point of the passage. The passage discusses the evolutionary process by which individual plants develop specific secondary substances and how natural selection shapes these substances based on their effectiveness as defenses against insects. This process has ultimately led to an array of different secondary substances and characteristic flavors and smells in different plant species.

D: This answer choice is partially correct in that secondary substances tend to be similar among related species, but it does not capture the broader point of the passage, which is the evolutionary interaction between plants and insects.

E: This answer choice is partially correct in that plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, but it does not capture the broader point of the passage, which is the evolutionary interaction between plants and insects.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
The passage describes the characteristics of primary substances and secondary substances in plants, and the evolutionary competition between plants and insects.

A: Although the secondary substances in plants serve as natural defenses against insects, this cannot be considered to be the main point of the passage.
B: This answer choice is incorrect because although the last portion of the passage refers to the association between specific insect species and certain plants, it does not represent the main point of the passage.
C: This answer choice accurately characterizes the focus of the passage and summarizes the main idea of the competition between plants and plant-eating insects and how this has given rise to the secondary substances that are characteristic of different species of plants.
D: Although this answer choice accurately highlights the fact that secondary substances tend to be similar among closely related species, it does not capture the main idea of the passage which is the interaction between plants and insects.
E: This answer choice is incorrect as it is too narrow in scope and does not encompass all of the ideas presented in the passage. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The passage discusses the various secondary substances present in plants that give them their distinctive tastes and smells. It then explains how insects have played a role in the development of these substances and how natural selection has favored certain secondary substances that have served as biochemical defenses against insects. The passage goes on to describe how the long-term competition between plants and insects has led to the development of specific tastes and smells in different plants. Therefore, the most accurate summary of the passage would be that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins
  B: endorse a claim simply because it is widely believed
  C: accept a claim for the sake of argument
  D: attempt to resolve an apparent paradox
  E: assert that their positions are supported by data
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author of passage A discusses research on happiness and wealth, particularly the effect of habituation and rivalry on people's sense of income sufficiency. Solnick and Hemenway's study is cited as evidence for the importance of people's relative income level for their happiness. 
  The author of passage B argues that people's desire to create value explains their satisfaction and happiness with higher income, rather than a desire to have more than others. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author of passage A argues that people compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income, which leads to the paradox of people reporting higher levels of happiness when their income is higher, but overall happiness in advanced societies does not increase with increasing income. The author cites the phenomena of habituation and rivalry to support this argument. 
  The author of passage B argues against the claim that the urge to demonstrate superiority is behind the desire for money and material wealth. Rather, the author argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful and have created value. The author supports this argument by citing evidence that success, not money per se, provides happiness, and wanting to create value benefits society. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author of passage A argues that people compare their income to some norm which is rising along with actual income. They claim that two phenomena - habituation and rivalry - push up the norm. The author of passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. The authors of both the passages are providing explanations for the relationship between wealth and happiness.
A: The author of passage B talks about the possible biological origins of the urge to demonstrate superiority, but this point is not central to their main argument. So, this is not the best answer.
B: Neither author endorses a claim simply because it is widely believed. So, this is not the best answer.
C: Neither author accepts a claim for the sake of the argument. So, this is not the best answer.
D: The author of passage A attempts to resolve an apparent paradox between the fact that richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people at any one time and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. So, this is not the best answer.
E: Both authors assert that their positions are supported by data. The author of passage A describes research concerning happiness and wealth and also cites a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway. The author of passage B talks about the data that show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. So, this is the best answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between wealth and happiness and explains a paradox that exists in this relationship.
  Passage B presents a different theory for why wealth is related to happiness than the one presented in Passage A.

Action: Answer("E") 
Both authors assert that their positions are supported by data. However, while the author of passage A discusses research evidence that supports their argument about the relationship between wealth and happiness, the author of passage B discusses data that they believe supports their alternative theory about why wealth is related to happiness. Neither author explains a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins, endorses a claim simply because it is widely believed, accepts a claim for the sake of argument, or attempts to resolve an apparent paradox.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The author of Passage A discusses the paradox of the relationship between wealth and happiness and attributes it to the phenomena of habituation and rivalry. 
  The author of Passage B is arguing against the idea that people care about one-upmanship and instead suggests that earning more makes people happy because it makes them feel successful and that they have created value.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author of passage A explores the paradox of happiness and wealth, explaining the phenomena of habituation and rivalry as factors that push up the income norm, thus leading to constant comparisons of income levels. The author then argues that how people compare themselves to their reference group (those most like them) is crucial for happiness.
  The author of passage B challenges the idea that people are driven by the urge to demonstrate superiority through wealth, arguing that people feel happier when they believe they have created value rather than simply having more wealth than others. The author supports this argument by providing evidence that earning more makes people feel successful and creates happiness. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The question asks about the argumentation of the authors of two passages.
  Passage A talks about research on the relationship between wealth and happiness. It argues that people's happiness is relative to their income and that there is a paradox in which while richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people, over time wealth does not bring about an increase in happiness. It identifies the norms of habituation and rivalry as contributing to such paradox.
  Passage B proposes an alternative theory to the rivalry phenomenon. It argues that people's happiness does not come from one-upmanship, but rather from the feeling of success and the creation of value. 
  A: Neither passage argues for a phenomenon's biological origins.
  B: There is no endorsement of a claim simply because it is widely believed in either passage.
  C: Neither passage accepts a claim for the sake of argument.
  D: Both Passage A and B attempt to resolve an apparent paradox about the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  E: Both authors assert that their positions are supported by data.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A discusses the paradox between happiness and wealth and explains two phenomena, habituation and rivalry, that push up the norm when our living standards increase. It also argues that comparing with our reference group is crucial for happiness.
  The passage B argues that earning more makes people feel successful and thus happy, and this is not necessarily due to the sense of one-upmanship.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author of passage A discusses research on the relationship between happiness and wealth, and identifies two phenomena (habituation and rivalry) that push up the norm people use to compare their income to that of others. The author of passage B argues that people are happier when they feel successful and have created value, and that material wealth is often used to demonstrate this success and value creation. The authors do not agree on the main reason for the relationship between wealth and happiness.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author of Passage A argues that increased wealth does not necessarily lead to increased happiness - people tend to adjust to their new standard of living and compare themselves to those who are better off, leading to a paradoxical situation where people are simultaneously wealthier and less happy than before. 
  The author of Passage B argues that it is not one-upmanship that drives people's desire for more wealth, but rather a desire to create value and feel successful.

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Passage B differs from passage A in that analogous displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more
Choices:
  A: engaged
  B: dismissive
  C: detached
  D: ironic
  E: skeptical
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that all behavior is caused by the operations of the brain, and therefore the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution. 
  Passage B argues that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely as long as they are not constrained by external sources.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Passage B differs from Passage A in that it presents its ideas in a more detached manner. Passage A is making a radical proposal that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution and instead focus on deterring future harms. Passage B, on the other hand, is presenting a philosophical argument about the nature of free will and determinism without taking a strong stance on the criminal-justice system. Therefore, "detached" is the best answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that nothing causes behavior other than the operations of the brain and suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions based on their sources.
  A: engaged means actively involved or interested, but neither passage shows a particularly strong involvement or interest in their ideas.
  B: dismissive means showing a lack of interest or rejection of ideas, and while Passage B presents a counterargument, it is not dismissive of Passage A's ideas.
  C: detached means objective or unemotional, and both passages present their ideas in a relatively objective manner.
  D: ironic means expressing the opposite of what is meant, and neither passage does so.
  E: skeptical means showing doubt or disbelief, and while Passage B presents a counterargument to Passage A's ideas, it does not express doubt or disbelief in them.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A suggests that recent findings in neuroscience change the way we think about the law and criminal justice. It suggests that people may not be acting out of their own free will, but rather as a result of brain functions beyond their control. As a result, the law should focus more on deterrence of future harm and less on retribution. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world. It suggests that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, and that those originating from a disease-free brain are free, even though they may be determined. 
  There is no indication in the question stem that either passage has a clear attitude towards the ideas it discusses.
Action: Answer("C") - Detached
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A and Passage B present different views about free will in relation to determinism and neuroscience.
  A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that free will is an illusion and that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  B presents a theory of soft determinism that argues that actions can still be free even in a deterministic world.
Action: Answer("C") 
Passage B does not show a strong emotional or critical stance towards the ideas it discusses; it presents a detached and objective view. It explains a theory of soft determinism and how it relates to the brain's role without taking a dismissive or skeptical attitude towards it.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that neuroscience radically changes the way we think about the law, and suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution for punishment.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism, and argues that actions can be free as long as they are not constrained.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that the official line in the law (that all that matters is whether you are rational) is problematic because it is possible to be rational but still have your behavior determined by factors beyond your control, like emotional centers in the brain. The passage suggests that this realization should lead to a different approach to criminal punishment, focused on deterrence rather than retribution. 
  Passage B discusses theories of free will and determinism, arguing that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources. The author suggests that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely as long as their actions are caused by internal sources. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A suggests that recent findings in neuroscience challenge the traditional view of the law and suggests a focus on deterrence.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Neither passage makes a direct statement regarding its attitude towards the ideas it discusses.
  However, Based on the language and tone of the passages, one can infer an attitude.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:

  Passage A argues that people's behavior is entirely caused by the operations of their brains and this insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution and instead focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it can coexist with determinism. Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Action: Answer("C")  
Passage A is focused on the implications of neuroscientific findings for the law, whereas Passage B is focused on a philosophical discussion of the concept of free will and determinism. Passage B is more detached in that it presents an argument without taking a strong stance for or against it.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A suggests that neuroscientific findings change how we think about the law, and it argues that punishments should be focused on deterring future harm rather than retribution. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world and introduces the theory of "soft determinism" that actions are free if they are not constrained by external sources.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Passage B differs from passage A in that its display towards the ideas is more detached. Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world and introduces the theory of "soft determinism" in a more informative tone without taking a strong stance on it as in passage A.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. The first proposes teaching about other cultures from within the majority culture's perspective, while the second proposes a neutral approach that does not judge other cultures by the standards of the majority culture, but still uses Western scientific methods to study other cultures. The passage criticizes the second version, arguing that it is still Eurocentric and fails to appreciate non-Western cultures on their own terms.
  
A: This statement may support the notion that adopting the perspectives and methods of a culture is impossible, which could further support the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, but it does not directly challenge the criticism.
B: This statement may suggest that some non-Western value systems are similar to the majority culture's values, but it does not directly challenge the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

E: This statement does not challenge the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, but it does support the idea that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage presents two versions of multicultural education. 
  The first version advocates for teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture and emphasizes liberal values. 
  The second version advocates for adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures but still utilizes Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures from the fields of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. 
  Critics argue that using Western methods of examination to understand non-Western cultures is an expression of cultural chauvinism and that genuine understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
Action: Answer("E")  
Reasoning: 
  The strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education would be that genuine understanding of another culture is not necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. However, none of the choices is a direct match with the statement. Option E states that "Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture." which contradicts this statement. Therefore, this question is flawed as the answer options do not provide a suitable answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The passage describes two versions of multicultural education. The first proposes to teach about other cultures using the perspectives and values of the majority culture, while the second proposes to adopt a neutral stance with respect to different value systems. Critics of the second version argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and insist that understanding another culture requires adopting their perspective and methods.

A: This statement is true but does not directly address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
B: This statement is also true but does not directly address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
C: This statement is a possible response to the objection, but it is not the strongest one.
D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument made by the critics of the second version of multicultural education.
E: This is a restatement of the objection to the second version of multicultural education and does not provide a strong objection against it.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education:
  - The first proposal teaches about other cultures within the context of the majority culture's values of liberalism.
  - The second proposal holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and use Western scientific methods to examine other cultures.
  Critics argue that each proposal is flawed.
  One objection to the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first since Western scientific methods involve a commitment to certain values, such as objectivity, that are not necessarily shared by other cultures studied. Thus, the attempt to understand nonscientific cultures using scientific methods is distorting and expresses an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version advocates for the teaching of other cultures through the lens of the majority culture's values.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. The first version advocates promoting multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture. The second version holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms, and that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures should be neutral with respect to value differences among cultures.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
  D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  E: "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.

  - Choice C is partially supported by the passage. The passage states that corridos share standard generic elements, including familiar linguistic and thematic conventions and ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. The despedida, for example, is a formal closing verse that follows a similar pattern across different corridos. However, the passage does not claim that all complete corridos have some lines in common.
  - Choice D is the best inference that can be drawn from the passage. The passage states that the despedida is a formal closing verse that follows a similar pattern across different corridos. The first and third lines are a set convention, while the second and fourth lines are variable. Therefore, most corrido variants have the same despedida.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage provides information about corridos, a type of narrative folk song that originated from the Lower Rio Grande Border of the United States and Mexico. Corridos are part of a ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain and narrates significant local happenings, affirming the cohesiveness of Border communities. They tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. The formal closing verse of a corrido, or despedida, shows a set convention of lines.

A: The passage does not provide any support for the claim that "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings. Information about the frequency of its performance is not discussed.
B: The passage mentions the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), and implies that complete surviving corridos exist, although it does not specify the frequency of that occurrence. The passage does not provide most support for the claim that most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
C: The passage implies that complete corridos have some lines in common. The formal closing verse of a corrido, or despedida, shows a set convention of lines. Therefore, the claim that all complete corridos have some lines in common is supported by the passage.
D: The passage provides support for the claim that most corrido variants have the same despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is presented as a set convention, implying that other corridos have similar despedidas.
E: The passage provides information about "El Corrido de Kiansis," the oldest corrido surviving in complete form. It was inspired by the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. The passage does not provide any support for the claim that it was composed by someone not from the Border region. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

Knowledge: 
  The passage describes corridos, which are narrative folk songs that come from the Lower Rio Grande Border region that is half in Mexico and half in the United States. Corridos typically deal with subject matter specific to the Border region and are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Corridos serve to commemorate significant local happenings and affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. They are composed of familiar images and ready-made lines, including the despedida, which is a formal closing verse. 
A: The passage does not provide any support for whether "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings. It mentions that corridos were sung at social gatherings to commemorate significant local happenings, but it does not provide any information about how often a specific corrido like "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was sung.
B: The passage mentions "El Corrido de Kiansis" as the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, but it does not provide support for or against whether most surviving corridos exist in complete form.
C: The passage provides support for this inference. It describes corridos as being composed of certain ready-made lines, including the despedida, which is a fixed convention. The despedida generally has four lines, the first and third of which are set conventions. The second and fourth lines are variable, but the fourth carries the name of the corrido or expresses its subject. Therefore, all complete corridos have some lines in common.
D: The passage provides support for this inference. It describes the despedida as a fixed convention in corridos, with certain lines being variable. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this, I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, but the fourth carries the name of the corrido or expresses its subject. Therefore, most corrido variants have the same despedida.
E: The passage does not provide any support for whether "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed by someone not from the Border region. It mentions that "El Corrido de Kiansis" records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s and is the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, but it does not provide any information about who composed it.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and the discovery of prions as a new type of protein pathogen that causes CJD and other degenerative neurological conditions. Prions are infectious and have the ability to reproduce themselves without the need for nucleic acid, and the body does not produce an immune response to them. CJD is inevitably fatal, and there is currently no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
A: The passage directly states that abnormally shaped prions cause cellular destruction and are responsible for the symptoms of CJD, so the author is likely to agree with this statement. 
B: The passage implies that all patients infected with CJD eventually die from the disease, so the author is unlikely to agree with this statement. 
C: The passage explicitly states that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction, so the author is likely to agree with this statement. 
D: The passage explicitly states that the body does not produce an immune response to prions, so the author is likely to agree with this statement. 
E: The passage explicitly states that scientists have yet to fully understand the mechanisms by which prions reproduce, so the author is likely to agree with this statement.

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions, which are infectious agents composed mainly of protein and lacking nucleic acid. Prions reproduce themselves by inducing normally shaped prions to transform themselves into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation and cause cellular destruction. Because prions naturally occur in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. CJD is inevitably fatal, with no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. It is believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions.
A: The author discusses the abnormal conformation of prions in brain tissue as being responsible for cellular destruction, including in CJD.
B: The passage does not mention the possibility of recovery from CJD. On the contrary, it states that CJD is inevitably fatal.
C: The passage strongly supports the idea that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
D: The passage discusses how prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins and can evade the immune response, leading to the inevitability of CJD resulting in death.
E: The passage does acknowledge that the mechanism by which prions reproduce has yet to be completely understood.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle, which holds that individuals respond rationally to economic incentives or disincentives by choosing the action that maximizes their overall satisfaction.
  A: A waiter conceals a large part of his tip income in order to reduce taxes, which is a response to economic incentives. This would be a rational response to the extent that the waiter believes that the benefits of avoiding taxes outweigh the costs if he were to be caught cheating.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license. This is a rational response to economic disincentives, since the cost of losing her driver's license would outweigh any potential benefits from speeding.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. This is a rational response to the economic incentives, since the cost of treating the pollutant is higher than the potential penalties for not treating it.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. This is a rational response to economic incentives since the benefit of soliciting bribes outweighs the cost of getting caught.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives, since the worker is not making a cost-benefit analysis but instead reacting impulsively and emotionally.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle, which holds that a rational individual will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  A: The waiter in this scenario is responding rationally to an economic incentive (i.e. reducing taxes) by concealing a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is unlikely that he will be detected and penalized.
  B: The motorist in this scenario is responding rationally to an economic disincentive (i.e. loss of driver's license) by avoiding speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: The industrialist in this scenario is responding rationally to an economic disincentive (i.e. cost of treatment) by continuing to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: The government official in this scenario is responding rationally to an economic disincentive (i.e. inadequate government salary) by risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. 
  E: The worker in this scenario is not responding rationally to an economic incentive or disincentive. Rather, he is committing a crime of passion by physically assaulting his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains that the principle of utility maximization holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
A: The waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized. This action is a rational response to economic incentives as he is trying to increase his earnings by reducing taxes, even though it is illegal.
B: The motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license. This action is a rational response to economic disincentives as she is trying to avoid a loss of her driver's license by obeying traffic laws.
C: The industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. This action is a rational response to economic incentives as he is trying to reduce his costs by avoiding treatment, even though it is illegal.
D: The government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes so as to support her family because her government salary is inadequate. This action is a rational response to economic incentives as she is trying to increase her earnings so as to support her family, even though it is illegal.
E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This action is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The passage explains the utility maximization principle, which holds that individuals make rational decisions concerning whether or not to engage in criminal activity based on a weighing process, in which the individual balances the expected utility or satisfaction of the possible outcomes against each other, after considering the likelihood of each outcome and then choosing the course of action whose outcome is most satisfying. 
A: The waiter's behavior is consistent with the utility maximization principle because he or she is attempting to maximize his or her satisfaction or expected utility by reducing taxes, and is taking in consideration the low probability of getting caught.
B: The motorist's behavior is a rational response to the expected outcome imposed by the speeding ticket and driving sanctions, which would lower the motorists' utility.
C: The industrialist's behavior is a rational decision based on the weighing of costs and benefits of treating pollutants, given the low fine.
D: The government official's behavior is a rational decision to maximize her utility given the inadequacy of her income in supporting her family.
E: The worker's behavior could be the result of emotional rage rather than a calculated decision based on an anticipation of utility. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle, which posits that rational individuals will choose an action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  A: The waiter's action is rational because he believes that the benefit of reducing his taxes -- thus raising his expected utility from the money he saves -- exceeds the cost of getting caught, which he believes is slight.
  B: The motorist's action is rational because she believes that the cost in terms of loss of her driver's license that she faces if caught speeding exceeds the benefit of getting to her destination more quickly.
  C: The industrialist's action is rational because he believes that the cost of treating the pollutants far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging them.
  D: The government official's action is rational because the cost of living has increased, making her salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: The worker's action is impulsive because it is not based on a rational calculation of costs and benefits; rather, it is based on an emotional response to what he perceives as an injustice.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the concept of utility maximization, which assumes that a rational person will decide to perform an action based on a comparison of the expected utility (satisfaction or pleasure) of performing the action against the expected utility of choosing a different action. Rational individuals respond to economic incentives in their decision-making, so economic disincentives and incentives may be used to make a certain action more or less attractive.
  A: The waiter is responding to economic incentives by concealing tip income to reduce taxes. However, this action is illegal and comes with a risk of being caught and punished, so it may not be an effective or rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  B: The motorist is responding to economic disincentives by avoiding speeding on a heavily-patrolled road to avoid the loss of her driver's license. This is a rational response to economic disincentives.
  C: The industrialist is acting rationally by choosing to continue illegal pollutant discharge because the cost of treating the pollutant would be greater than the cost of paying a fine. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  D: The government official is responding to economic incentives by soliciting bribes to support her family, but this action is illegal and may result in prosecution and punishment. It may not be an effective or rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  E: The worker is not responding to economic incentives or disincentives, but rather taking revenge for perceived mistreatment, which is an impulsive crime.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle, which holds that individuals make rational decisions based on the expected utility of their actions, where the expected utility is a function of the utilities of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the likelihood of each outcome occurring.
  A: A waiter deciding to conceal tip income to reduce taxes is a decision based on a calculation of expected utility and is consistent with the utility maximization principle.
  B: A motorist deciding not to speed on a heavily patrolled stretch of road is a decision based on a calculation of expected utility and is consistent with the utility maximization principle.
  C: An industrialist deciding to illegally discharge pollutants because it is less expensive than treatment is a decision based on a calculation of expected utility and is consistent with the utility maximization principle.
  D: A government official risking prosecution for bribery because of inadequate salary is a decision based on a calculation of expected utility and is consistent with the utility maximization principle.
  E: A worker physically assaulting his former supervisor because of perceived unfair dismissal is not an example of a rational decision based on a calculation of expected utility. It is an impulsive crime of passion that is not premeditated and has not been analyzed for its anticipated overall satisfaction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage explains the utility maximization principle, which suggests that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility, given a choice of actions. The expected utility of an action is determined by weighing the utilities of possible outcomes, according to the likelihood of each outcome occurring, and adding up these weighted utilities. 
A: A waiter concealing a large part of his tip income to reduce taxes demonstrates a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. 
B: A motorist avoiding speeding on a heavily patrolled road demonstrates a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
C: An industrialist continuing to illegally discharge pollutants into a river due to the cost of treatment exceeding the fine for illegal discharge demonstrates a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
D: A government official soliciting bribes due to her government salary being inadequate to support her and her family demonstrates a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
E: A worker physically assaulting his former supervisor due to being dismissed from his job and believing the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair does not relate to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage describes the utility maximization principle, which holds that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility, by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.

A: The waiter is trying to reduce his tax, which is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
B: The motorist is avoiding a fine and loss of her driver's license, which is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
C: The industrialist is choosing a cheaper option because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant, which is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
D: The government official is soliciting bribes because her government salary is inadequate to support her and her family, which is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
E: The worker is committing a crime of passion and seeking personal revenge, which is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the economic principle of utility maximization that holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their expected overall satisfaction or utility in response to economic incentives or disincentives. The expected utility of an action is determined by weighing the utilities of the possible outcomes, by the likelihood of each outcome occurring, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  
A: The waiter's decision to conceal a large part of his tip income from the government in order to reduce his taxes is a rational response that maximizes his expected overall satisfaction. He believes that it is unlikely that he will be detected and penalized, and therefore his expected utility increases with that action.
B: A motorist's decision to not speed on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and a speeding ticket will lead to the loss of her driver's license is a rational response that maximizes her expected overall satisfaction. The motorist considers the likelihood of getting caught and losing her driver's license, and weighs that against the utility of getting where she needs to go faster. She chooses to not speed because the expected utility of getting caught is not worth the utility of getting there faster.
C: An industrialist's decision to continue to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant is a rational response that maximizes his expected overall satisfaction. He weighs the costs of treatment against the fine for illegal discharge and determines that the expected utility of continuing to illegally discharge the pollutant is higher than the expected utility of treating it.
D: A government official's decision to solicit bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family is a rational response that maximizes her expected overall satisfaction. She weighs the utility of getting the bribes against the likelihood of getting caught and punished. She chooses to solicit the bribes because the expected utility of getting caught is not worth the utility of the money.
E: A worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives, but an impulsive response to a perceived injustice.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.
  D: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.

  The passage discusses the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. 
  The first style is late-Romantic music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies. 
  The second style pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. 
  The third style developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.

Action: Answer("A")  
Based on the passage, the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one. The passage states that Schoenberg "worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory," and that he pushed the harmonies of his first style until they no longer had a tonal basis in his second style. Finally, he created the 12-tone technique in his third style. This suggests that each style builds on the previous one, representing a natural progression in his development as a composer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  Schoenberg began in the late-Romantic manner, then pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis, and finally developed the 12-tone technique.
  The author describes each of the three styles in a positive manner, highlighting Schoenberg's technical mastery and the emotional states his music can convey.
  The passage does not suggest that any of the styles were inexplicable departures from the previous one.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The passage describes that Schoenberg's music evolved through three different musical styles. The first style was in the late-Romantic manner, with shifting chromatic harmonies. The second style was characterized by unstable harmonies that no longer had a tonal basis. The third style, Schoenberg developed the 12-tone technique. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at a high level of technical mastery.

Action: Answer("A") 
The author suggests that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one. The passage states that Schoenberg "worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory" and that "he pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis." Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. The passage also notes that "Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery," which suggests that he had control over his musical choices and that his development of new musical styles was intentional and purposeful, rather than inexplicable departures from previous styles.

Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style was the late-Romantic manner.
  The second style was characterized by unstable harmonies that no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style was characterized by the 12-tone technique, which brought a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilized it.
  The author suggests that Schoenberg's music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow as his career progressed. 
Action: Answer("E") 
Reasoning: The passage states that the second style was a departure from the first, but the third style was a natural progression from the first. While the third style did bring about a new system of order, it was still a continuation of Schoenberg's work in the sense that it built upon his earlier explorations of unstable harmonies. The author seems to suggest that Schoenberg's work was a natural progression of musical style, rather than something inexplicable. Therefore, the most likely answer is E - "The second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first."
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Schoenberg worked in three different musical styles.
  He began in the late-Romantic manner and later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  He developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
  As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow.
  The author admires Schoenberg because of his ability to precisely delineate recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Action: Answer("E")  
The author describes the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote as follows: Schoenberg began in the late-Romantic manner and later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis; he then developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. Finally, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. Given that the author characterizes Schoenberg's style as constantly changing and evolving, it seems least likely that the author would argue that each new style represents a natural progression from the previous one. Instead, the author seems to admire Schoenberg for his innovation and his ability to break new ground in each new style. Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that the second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first. Answer("E")
Response 8:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two ways in which historically art was "produced by and for political and social elites." 
  The sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to analyze art produced the second way, which is where the elite created, or had created, a work that expressed and mirrored their ideals and way of life.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
  Some of the art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
The passage presents two different ways that art was historically "produced by and for political and social elites." It also discusses the challenges faced by sociohistorical critics who analyze such art. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that historically, there have been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them. So, the correct answer is E. The other answer choices are either too narrow, unrelated, or do not accurately reflect the main point of the text.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the different ways art was produced by and for political and social elites in history.
  The two ways were either by commissioning a famous artist to produce something for display, or by creating a work that expresses and mirrors one's ideals and way of life.
  Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
  The more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example.
  A great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of analysis to justify the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage discusses the ways in which art has been commissioned and produced by political and social elites throughout history. It also examines the tendency of sociohistorical critics to view art as reflecting the ideology of these elites. The main point of the passage is that this view is overly simplistic because there are two different ways in which art can be produced by and for political and social elites. The passage also suggests that the taste of the governing and well-to-do middle classes has not always been apt to produce art that endures. Finally, it argues that sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to make their claims about the embodiment of elite ideals in works of art. Thus, the best answer choice is B.
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage discusses two different ways that the elite produced art historically, and how sociohistorical critics analyze this art. The passage also mentions some of the difficulties in analyzing art produced by the elite, given the diversity of tastes and opinions within the elite classes. 
A: While the passage does mention that historically the governing and well-to-do middle classes were the primary patrons of the arts, this is not the main point of the passage. 
B: This choice accurately reflects a point made in the passage, but it is not the main point. 
C: This choice is not accurate, as the passage suggests that some patrons did indeed care about affecting the development of the arts, and that some art produced by the elite went against elite values. 
D: This choice accurately reflects the main point of the passage, as it discusses the difficulties that sociohistorical critics face in analyzing art produced by the elite, and the way in which they must construct an analysis of how the art embodies elite ideals. 
E: This choice accurately reflects the main point of the passage, as it discusses the two different ways in which members of the elite had art produced for them. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the ways in which the elite classes historically commissioned art. It argues that there are two distinct ways in which this has been done. The first is simply to engage a well-known artist to produce something that reflects well on the patron's taste, while the second involves creating a work that expresses the patron's ideals and way of life. The passage also notes that historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class. The other answer choices, while they touch on some aspects discussed in the passage, do not accurately capture the main point of the passage.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about a number of things, including:
  - Two different ways historical art had been "produced by and for political and social elites."
  - The preferences and tastes of the aristocratic and middle classes, and how they may not have always produced art that endures.
  - The challenges of analyzing historical art produced for the elites.
  - The fact that some enduring art was produced that went against the grain of elite values.
  
Main Point:
  The main point of the passage is to provide a nuanced discussion of the relationship between art and elite classes throughout history, and to highlight how sociohistorical critics analyze this relationship. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage provides a critical view of sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes. The main point of the passage is that the situation is more complicated than that and that there are two different ways in which art has been produced for the elite classes. Additionally, the passage argues that the taste of the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes has not always been apt to produce art that endures and that some of the most enduring art was created in defiance of elite values. The passage argues that sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify their claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite. Therefore, the best answer is B.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
  The passage is mainly discussing sociohistorical interpretations of art which suggest that art reflects the ideals of the elite class that produced it. The author notes that there are two ways art has been produced for the elite class, and that it is not always the case that art produced for the elite is of enduring value or reflective of the elite's ideals. The author also suggests that some art produced may have gone against the grain of the elite's values and been paid for unwillingly, but that sociohistorical critics can still argue that the art reflects the ideals of the elite in hidden ways. The main point of the passage, therefore, is that sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic, as there are many factors to consider when analyzing the relationship between elite patronage and art. Therefore, 'B' is the correct answer.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("D")

The main point of the passage is to argue that sociohistorical interpretations of art need to be more nuanced than simply claiming that art reflects the ideals and values of the elite. The author describes two different ways in which art historically was produced by and for political and social elites. The author also notes that some of the art that went against the grain of elite values endured, and that sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to argue that such art embodied the ideals of the elite. Choice D most accurately captures the main argument of the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

Choices:
  A: furnish a brief account of the evolution of academic biotechnology research

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10)
  C: "markedly inclusive" (line 16)
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24)
  E: "alien to the European style" (line 51)
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies failed to consider traditional preliterate modes of communicating personal history and cultural constructs of Native American peoples. The author also notes that these scholars focused on written documents and did not take into account the inclusive identity and relational aspect of self that was present in some Native American cultures.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The author's attitude towards the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies mentioned in the passage is negative, as indicated by the phrase "failed to address" (line 9).
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies, which focused on written, edited, and translated life histories produced through bicultural composite authorship. The author argues that such scholarship overlooked the traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history and failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples. The author also describes the inclusive idea of self in some pre-contact Native American cultures and the oral and visual ways in which personal history was expressed and recorded. 

Analysis: To answer this question, we need to identify the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is discussed in the passage. The author provides a critique of this scholarship and suggests that it has limitations and omissions. Therefore, we should look for a phrase that conveys a negative or critical attitude.

A: "failed to address" is a negative phrase that suggests a lack of attention or adequacy, but it does not necessarily indicate the author's attitude toward the scholarship.

B: "highly diverse" is a neutral phrase that describes the Native American peoples, not the earlier scholarship.

C: "markedly inclusive" is a positive phrase that describes the idea of self in some Native American cultures, not the earlier scholarship.

D: "seemingly more fragmented" is a neutral phrase that compares the oral mode of autobiography to the European written mode, but it does not necessarily indicate the author's attitude.

E: "alien to the European style" is a negative phrase that suggests a fundamental difference between the Native American and European modes of autobiography, and it implies that the earlier scholarship was inadequate or biased due to its Eurocentric perspective.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how scholars have primarily focused on written autobiographies produced through non-indigenous collaboration with Native American people, which may not accurately represent cultural constructs of Native American peoples or their traditional modes of communicating personal history. 
  A: The phrase "failed to address" indicates a negative attitude towards the earlier scholarship, but this phrase is used to describe a specific aspect of their work, rather than the overall attitude towards it. 
  B: The phrase "highly diverse" is neutral and simply describes the Native American peoples being studied. 
  C: The phrase "markedly inclusive" is used to describe pre-contact Native American cultural constructs of identity, which is presented as a contrast to the assumptions underlying the concept of autobiography. It is not directly related to the author's attitude towards earlier scholarship. 
  D: The phrase "seemingly more fragmented" is used to describe the traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history that Native American peoples used, which is presented as a contrast to the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. It is not directly related to the author's attitude towards earlier scholarship. 
  E: The phrase "alien to the European style" is used to describe the intercultural collaboration involved in traditional Native American modes of autobiographical expression, which may seem different from the European style of autobiography. It is not directly related to the author's attitude towards earlier scholarship.

  The author argues that these modes of communication are just as important to consider when studying Native American autobiographical expression.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how scholars studying Native American autobiographies have focused on written documents produced in collaboration with non-Native Americans and have overlooked traditional preliterate modes of communicating personal history that were inclusive and often involved participation from fellow tribal members. The author believes that Native American autobiographical expressions were shaped not only by the individual, but also by cultural perspectives, and should be viewed as both individual and cultural narratives.
  
  A: The phrase "failed to address" (line 9) suggests a negative attitude, but it is describing the limitations of the earlier scholarship rather than the author's attitude toward it.
  
  B: The phrase "highly diverse" (line 10) is describing the Native American peoples rather than the earlier scholarship.
  
  C: The phrase "markedly inclusive" (line 16) is describing the pre-contact Native American cultures and is presented as a contrast to the European assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography. The author seems to have a positive attitude toward this inclusivity.
  
  D: The phrase "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24) is describing the preliterate modes of communicating personal history used by Native Americans and is presented as a contrast to the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. The author is not expressing a negative attitude toward this fragmentation, but rather acknowledging it as a different mode of autobiographical expression.
  
  E: The phrase "alien to the European style" (line 51) is describing the intercultural collaboration involved in Native American autobiographical expressions rather than the earlier scholarship itself. The author does not express a negative attitude toward this collaboration, but rather sees it as a way in which the individual's narrative is shaped by cultural perspectives.
  
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how most scholars studying Native American autobiographies have focused on written accounts and neglected traditional, preliterate modes of communication.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism
  D: admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture
  E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. According to the passage, the Pin Factory emphasizes the huge increases in efficiency that can be achieved through increased size, but increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly. The Invisible Hand refers to the idea that a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good. For this to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. 
A: This statement does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It only points out that there might be smaller businesses in certain regions that exert monopoly power.
B: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This statement strengthens, rather than undermines, the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It suggests that businesses collude to set prices as a true monopoly would.
D: This statement is a reasonable factor to consider, but it does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It only suggests that the optimal size for achieving increasing returns varies by industry.
E: This statement also does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It only suggests that there might be a point at which further specialization may not lead to significant gains in productivity.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  
A: This statement does not necessarily undermine the author’s connection between increased size and monopoly power. It does not address the size of the larger businesses in the same industry in other regions, and it does not provide any indication of whether the larger businesses are able to command lower costs than the smaller businesses. 
B: This statement is irrelevant to the author’s argument about monopoly power, as it does not address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This statement supports the author’s argument that larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. It strengthens the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
D: This statement does not weaken the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power. Rather, it supports the idea that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, which is consistent with the idea that increasing returns can lead to the domination of a few players in an industry.

The idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
A: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it acknowledges that some businesses are able to exert monopoly power.
B: This statement discusses the impact of specialization on worker salaries and does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This statement supports the idea that increasing returns to scale create a tendency toward monopoly.
D: This statement acknowledges that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies by industry, but it does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
E: This statement discusses the offsetting factors that can reduce the gains made by making workers more specialized, but it does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

  The author argues that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. 
  Larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players.
  For the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  Economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns are notoriously hard to represent mathematically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  If the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, then the connection between increased size and monopoly power becomes weaker because not all industries are equally susceptible to it. Hence, businesses in some industries may be able to achieve larger size without necessarily driving out smaller firms through monopoly power. Therefore, option D would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power. The other options do not undermine the connection in the same manner that option D does.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the contradiction between the concept of increasing returns to scale and the importance of having many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  A: This statement suggests that there are exceptions to the rule that larger businesses tend to have lower costs than smaller businesses, but it does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  B: This statement is about the potential negative consequences of the increased specialization of work, which is not directly related to the author's argument about increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  C: This statement reinforces the idea that a few dominant players in an industry can behave like a monopoly, undermining the importance of having many competitors in each industry.
  D: This statement suggests that there is variability in the size at which a business begins to experience economies of scale, which could undermine the idea that larger businesses necessarily lead to monopoly power.
  E: This statement suggests that there are limits to the benefits of specialization, but it does not directly address the author's argument. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because it enables larger businesses to achieve lower costs and drive out smaller competitors.
  The idea of the invisible hand working properly depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  
A: This statement suggests that there are cases where larger businesses do not always achieve lower costs and monopoly power. However, this does not undermine the author's connection between increased size and monopoly power.
B: This statement talks about the effect of specialization on workers' salaries, but it does not relate to the author's argument about increased size and monopoly power.
C: This statement seems to support the author's connection between increased size and monopoly power, as businesses that dominate an industry as a few players can collude to set high prices.
D: This statement does not undermine the author's connection between increased size and monopoly power, but rather highlights that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies in different industries.
E: This statement relates to the productivity gains of specialization, but it does not address the author's argument about increased size and monopoly power.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale lead to natural tendency towards monopoly.
  Diminishing returns do not lead to monopoly.
  The idea of diminishing returns has dominated economic theory for almost two centuries.
  Until the 1970s, economists failed to bring the concept of the Pin Factory (increasing returns to scale) into the mainstream of economic thought.
  The Pin Factory, or increasing returns to scale, tend to characterize many enterprises, such as railroads. 
  The author argues that the assumption of diminishing returns led to elegant formalism and hence to following the line of least mathematical resistance.
 
A: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It merely states that the monopoly power is not significant in all regions. 
B: This statement is not related to the connection between increased size and monopoly power. Instead, it talks about the workers' salaries. 
C: This statement supports the connection between increased size and monopoly power. Collusion among big players in an industry is one of the ways monopoly power can be exerted. 
D: This statement suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies by industry. It does not undermine the argument that increasing returns to scale lead to the natural tendency towards monopoly power. 
E: This statement argues against the idea that increased specialization always leads to increasing returns. However, the author's argument is not about whether increasing specialization necessarily leads to larger returns, but rather that increasing returns tend to lead to monopoly power. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which is opposed to the idea of the invisible hand working properly. The invisible hand requires many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Thus, if the connection between increased size and monopoly power is undermined, the author's argument would be weakened.
A: This statement suggests that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is not absolute, as there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions. It does not really undermine the author's argument, as it is still possible for monopolies to arise and undermine the invisible hand.
B: This statement is talking about the effect of narrow tasks on workers' salaries, and has no bearing on the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It does not undermine the author's argument.
C: This statement acknowledges that businesses in a monopoly position can act like monopolies, which is consistent with the author's argument. It does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
D: This statement suggests that the connection between increased size and monopoly power varies depending on the industry, which may weaken the author's argument slightly. However, it does not provide a strong counterargument that undermines the connection, as increasing returns to scale still create a tendency toward monopoly, even if the threshold for achieving them varies across industries. 
E: This statement suggests that there may be diminishing returns to specialization, which could weaken the argument that increasing returns to scale inevitably lead to monopoly power. However, the statement also mentions other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover, which suggests that the relationship between specialization and productivity is complex. This statement does not provide a clear counterargument that undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly, which is opposed to the idea that free markets always get it right.
  The connection between increased size and monopoly power is that as a firm gets larger, it can achieve economies of scale that give it a competitive advantage over smaller rivals. Increasing returns can therefore lead to a natural monopoly, where a single firm dominates the market.
  A, C, and E do not address the relationship between increased size and monopoly power.
  B is related to the Pin Factory, but it does not address the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author is discussing the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand and how these two concepts oppose each other in terms of the increasing returns to scale. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players.
A: This answer choice suggests that there are some industries in which larger businesses are not dominant. This may be true, but it does not specifically undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It is also mentioned in the passage that larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business.
B: This answer choice is unrelated to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This answer choice suggests that even when an industry is not a true monopoly, businesses may collude to set prices. However, this does not specifically undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It is also mentioned in the passage that a few players tend to dominate an industry.
D: This answer choice suggests that the size that a business must reach in order to achieve increasing returns varies by industry. This implies that not all larger businesses will achieve increased returns to scale and hence lower costs. If true, this suggests that the connection between increased size and monopoly power may not be as strong as suggested in the passage. 
E: This answer choice suggests that making workers too specialized may have other negative impacts that offset any productivity gains. However, this is unrelated to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature

Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's view on literature and reality and how it differs from the radical critics' view. Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was the crucial source of literature, but his understanding of reality went far deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. He believed that the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless because reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer, according to Dostoyevsky, was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the opposing views of Russian literary critics regarding the role of literature in society. 
  Dostoyevsky's position on the role of literature in society was unique and he did not agree with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality and that reality was more than tangible. 
  He also believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit and should not be judged solely on political or utilitarian views.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's position on literature and art in relation to reality and the radical critics.
  A: The passage supports this answer. Dostoyevsky believed reality was shaped by the person who experienced it, and there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  B: The passage does not support this answer. Dostoyevsky's disagreement with the radical critics was not about the representation of political views in literature, but rather their demand for art to have a particular political view.
  C: The passage does not support this answer. Dostoyevsky's view was that reality was crucial to literature, but it went deeper than the one prevailing among the radical critics.
  D: The passage supports this answer. Dostoyevsky did not believe that realism facilitated the exposure of social inequities or contributed to the creation of a new society. He thought a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," and the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms.
  E: The passage does not support this answer. Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality was central to his view of successful literature.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A is about Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science which concerns the power of negative evidence, and his use of the logical asymmetry.
  Passage B is about the discovery of Uranus and Neptune's orbits, and how scientists changed their auxiliary assumptions to predict their orbits.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, particularly the power of negative evidence and the importance of searching for evidence that would disprove bold theories. 
  Passage B gives two examples of scientific theories being refined or revised based on observations and calculations.
Option A: Passage A mentions that a theory's failure to make accurate predictions suggests that one or more of its premises may be false, but it does not mention repudiating experimental results. Passage B describes how astronomers used their observations to refine their theories, but it does not mention repudiating experimental results. 
Option B: The astronomers in Passage B revise their assumptions about the mass and location of planets to account for an anomaly in Uranus's orbit, and they hypothesize the existence of another planet to account for an anomaly in Mercury's orbit. Passage A suggests that the search for negative evidence is at the heart of scientific research and that scientists should be willing to revise their theories in the face of disconfirming evidence. 
Option C: Passage A says that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof, but it also acknowledges that a theory's deductive entailment of a false prediction would also disprove the theory. Passage B describes how astronomers refined their theories to account for anomalies in Uranus's and Mercury's orbits, but it does not mention disproving theories outright. 
Option D: Passage B illustrates the use of calculations to predict the orbit of Uranus and the subsequent discovery of the planet Neptune based on the calculated orbit. The passage also describes how astronomers used calculations to predict the orbit of Mercury and hypothesized the existence of another planet to account for discrepancies in the predicted and observed orbits. 
Option E: Passage A suggests that scientific theories must be testable through predictions that can be confirmed or disconfirmed by experiments. Passage B does not discuss untestable theories. 
Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the political activism of Mexican Americans in the United States from the 1930s to the 1960s, and argues that their political diversity has been underestimated, and that their views may not have been representative of the broader ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. The passage suggests that Garcia's study suffers from two flaws. One flaw is that Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent; Garcia emphasizes an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. The second flaw is that Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period.

A: The passage does not support this statement. The passage acknowledges that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States occurred from 1930 to 1960, but it does not argue that this resulted in an increase in ethnic consciousness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the approach of Katherine Dunham, an anthropologist and choreographer, to researching traditional Caribbean dance forms, in which Dunham participated in the dances herself. This approach diverged from the prevailing methodology in the field of social research at the time, which emphasized detachment from the phenomena under study. Dunham's approach allowed her to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural practices and develop new forms of ballet that incorporated traditional dance techniques. The passage does not explicitly state the author's opinion of the colleagues mentioned in line 33.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the pioneering work of Katherine Dunham in the field of dance ethnology, her success in bringing traditional dance techniques from various cultures into modern North American dance, and her unique approach to research, which involved participating physically in the dances she was observing.
  The colleagues mentioned in line 33 advised Dunham against becoming too involved in the dances she was observing because of the extreme physical demands and because they subscribed to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
Action: Answer("C")  
The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with the statement "They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor."

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and B both mention jury nullification, which is when a jury acquits a defendant in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact.
  Passage A argues that the power of jury nullification creates problems because it is used in unknown and potentially nefarious ways, because juries often lack sufficient evidence to make a reasoned decision, and because juries are not legislators.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful in cases where police or prosecutors are overzealous, where a law is unjust, or where there are circumstances that make a case too trivial to result in a conviction. It also argues that jury nullification can help indicate to the legislature that there may be a problem with a law in question.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss the practice of jury nullification. However, the authors of the two different passages seem to have different views about its implications for the legal system.
  A: One of the concerns the author of Passage A has with jury nullification is that it is difficult to know when and how often it occurs. The author also thinks that jurors may be insufficiently informed to make a reasoned decision about nullification and that the power to nullify is best left to elected legislators and judges rather than unelected and unaccountable jurors.
  B: The author of Passage B thinks that jury nullification can serve as a useful check on the power of prosecutors and can also signal to the legislature that there may be problems with the laws on the books. The author suggests that jury nullification is a legitimate exercise of the jury's discretion and that it can lead to a more just application of the law.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems caused by jury nullification and argues that juries are not fit to exercise the power to nullify.
  Passage B provides arguments in favor of jury nullification, suggesting that it can help correct certain flaws in the criminal justice system.
  
Comparison:
  A: Both passages seem to agree that juries are not required to explain their verdicts.
  B: Both passages seem to agree that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
  C: The passages do not explicitly discuss bias in decision-making, either of jurors or elected officials, so this is not a point of disagreement.
  D: This is a point of disagreement between the passages, as Passage A argues that the jury's role is only to apply the law, while Passage B suggests that juries can also interpret the law by deciding when and how to apply it.
  E: While Passage B does argue for juries to have more discretion in certain cases, it does not address whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion, so this is not a point of disagreement.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains the concept of jury nullification, and some problems it can create. It argues that juries are neither required nor qualified to interpret laws, and that they can be unelected and unaccountable. It also suggests that instances of jury nullification are few, and that their effects are not clear or certain.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification is a useful tool for the jurors to express their disagreement with certain laws or particular applications of the law. It also suggests that jurors are diverse and reasonable enough to make such decisions, and that nullification can help to identify problems with existing laws and prompt revisions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses jury nullification, its problems, and argues that juries are not the appropriate institution to nullify laws.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be helpful to the legislature by highlighting problems with specific laws. It also argues that a jury nullification decision is unlikely to be made based merely on whims.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification causes problems because it is impossible to know how often it occurs, juries often lack sufficient evidence to make a reasoned decision, and juries are not elected representatives. 
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful tool to help identify issues with legislative or prosecutorial decisions.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the potential problems with jury nullification and argues that juries are not well-suited to act as legislators, interpret the law, or consider the effects of their decisions on others.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can serve as a useful check on overzealous law enforcement and can also serve as a way for juries to signal to legislators that a law may be problematic.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification is problematic, since juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, and are not legislators. 
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be helpful when it acts as a safety valve and provides feedback to the legislature about the validity of the law. 

Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it. Passage A argues that jurors are not legislators and have no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Passage B, on the other hand, argues that when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification is a problem because it creates uncertainty and inconsistency in applying the law, it is often based on incomplete information or arbitrary criteria, and it is not the place of unelected and unaccountable jurors to legislate or interpret the law.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a necessary safety valve when law enforcement officials are overzealous or when laws are too broadly written or unjust, and that it can serve as a feedback mechanism for the legislature.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues against the power of jury nullification because juries are not required to explain their verdicts, they often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, and jurors are not legislators.
  Passage B argues for the power of jury nullification because it acts as a safety valve, assists the legislature, and indicates to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question. It also argues that instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration
  D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  E: Some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the contribution of ultraviolet light from the sun to skin cancer, the role of ozone in screening out much of this radiation, and the depletion of the ozone layer that has been caused by manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs was discovered through the research of Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland and has led to the development of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which banned the production of ozone-depleting gases. CFCs were used in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation

They became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response, which led to an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
  A: The passage does not discuss the capability of a chemical to react with forms of oxygen other than ozone.
  
  B: The passage does not discuss whether a chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there.
  
  C: The passage suggests that one reason CFCs are particularly damaging to the ozone layer is that they chemically react with chlorine and deplete ozone against. Therefore, testing to determine whether a new chemical would chemically react with chlorine could be relevant.
  
  D: The passage does not specifically discuss shared chemical properties between CFCs and other chemicals or elements.
  
  E: The passage discusses how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, testing to determine what would happen to a new chemical when subjected to ultraviolet radiation could be relevant.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the role of CFCs in the depletion of the ozone layer, which has been shown to be a pressing environmental threat. The work of Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland led to the development of an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  A: This experiment would not be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  B: This experiment would not be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  C: This experiment would be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, since the reaction with chlorine is what depletes the ozone layer.
  D: This experiment would not be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  E: This experiment would be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, since CFCs break down into constituent elements when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the impact of manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer.
  The ozone layer is important because it screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer leads to increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which is harmful to human health and the environment.
  
A: Testing whether a chemical is capable of reacting with oxygen other than ozone would not be useful in determining whether the chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
B: Testing whether a chemical reacts with other chemicals commonly found in the lower atmosphere would not be useful in determining whether the chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
C: Testing a chemical to determine whether it would react with chlorine is useful because chlorine is a key element involved in the chemical reactions that lead to ozone depletion. If a chemical reacts with chlorine and produces similar harmful effects as CFCs, then it may not be a suitable replacement for CFCs.
D: Testing the chemical to see what properties it shares with chlorine would not be useful in determining whether the chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
E: Testing whether the chemical would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation is useful because this is the process by which CFCs lead to ozone depletion. If a chemical breaks down into components that are harmful to the ozone layer, then it may not be a suitable replacement for CFCs.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the depletion of the ozone layer caused by CFCs, which chemically react with ozone, releasing chlorine and destroying ozone molecules in the process. The depletion of the ozone layer has led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
A: The passage does not suggest that testing whether a chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone would be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  
B: The passage does not suggest that testing whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there would be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  
C: The passage does suggest that testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, because the depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the release of chlorine into the stratosphere as a result of CFCs breaking down under ultraviolet radiation.
  
D: The passage does not suggest that testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine would be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  
E: The passage suggests that testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, because CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, under ultraviolet radiation, leading to the release of chlorine into the stratosphere and the depletion of the ozone layer.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Molina and Rowland's research showed that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and destroy the ozone layer.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  Chemicals that are considered as CFC replacements should not pose a threat to the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, testing to see whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. This is because the CFCs released into the lower atmosphere slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere and chemically react with chlorine atoms present there, eventually depleting the ozone layer. Therefore, testing to see whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there would provide information on whether the chemical has the potential to degrade into stable compounds that can also contribute to ozone depletion.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the way in which CFCs react with the ozone layer and contribute to its depletion.
  Molina and Rowland's research led to the development of an international agreement to ban CFCs.

Action: Answer("E")
Explanation: 
  The passage describes the way CFCs slowly rise to the stratosphere and are broken down by ultraviolet radiation.
  Since the damage caused by CFCs is due to this reaction with ultraviolet radiation, testing a chemical's response to ultraviolet radiation would provide the most relevant information about whether or not it would damage the ozone layer. 
  None of the other experiments mentioned would necessarily indicate whether a chemical was likely to damage the ozone layer.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs depleted the ozone layer.
  CFCs were highly volatile chemicals.
  CFCs chemically react with and break down ozone molecules.
  The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
Action: Answer("E") 
Based on the passage, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be the most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, who showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. They observed that CFCs, when released into the lower atmosphere, slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere, where they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms, which in turn could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. Their research led to an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
  A: The information yielded by testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone would not be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  B: The information yielded by testing to see whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there would not be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  C: The information yielded by testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  D: The information yielded by testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine would not be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  E: The information yielded by testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  The passage discusses how CFCs break down into constituent elements, including chlorine, which is devastating to the ozone layer.
  The passage discusses the work of scientists Molina and Rowland and their advocacy for public policy changes to address the depletion of the ozone layer caused by CFCs.
  There is interest in finding a replacement for CFCs that would not damage the ozone layer.

Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, testing to see whether a chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. This is because CFCs slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere, where they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Therefore, a chemical that would react with other chemicals in the lower atmosphere and not release harmful compounds into the stratosphere would be a good candidate for a replacement for CFCs.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about the scientific discovery of the depletion of the ozone layer and its cause by manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  Molina and Rowland showed that the CFCs, when released into the lower atmosphere, diffuse upward into the stratosphere where they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in chlorine concentration in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Any chemical that can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer should not chemically react with chlorine, which is the key reason for the depletion of the ozone layer.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science and the power of negative evidence. It mentions that when an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation and that negative evidence rarely conclusive. 
  Passage B explains how the predictions of the orbit of Uranus and Mercury were not correct based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions due to the presence of auxiliary premises that appealed to other theories.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  In Passage B, the planet Mercury most clearly illustrates a disturbing force as described in Passage A. The prediction of Mercury's orbit was based on Newton's law and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and other planets. However, the predictions were not borne out, and the astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. The hypothesis of Vulcan was the result of the failure of the predictions, indicating the presence of a disturbing force, which could be an unaccounted planet or a flaw in the Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The question refers to a disturbance described in Passage A, which states that "they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc."
Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Mercury and found that their predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A is about Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science and the power of negative evidence. Popper emphasizes that scientific research involves not only generating bold theories but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. However, he does not capture the actual situation scientists face, as they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  Passage B talks about the discovery of Uranus and later the orbit of Mercury. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the predicted orbit was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions, such as the assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses K. Popper's view on the power of negative evidence in science.
  Passage B recounts examples of attempts to predict the orbits of planets using Newton's laws and auxiliary premises, and how the predictions sometimes failed due to incorrect auxiliary assumptions and/or the effects of other disturbing forces.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A defines auxiliary premises as other premises besides a theory that are needed to derive a theory's predictions. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. Passage A also mentions that one of the auxiliary premises used to predict Uranus's orbit was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  
  Passage B describes the discovery of Uranus and Neptune. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. They discovered Neptune later. Passage B also describes the orbit of Mercury and that the hypothesis of an extra planet was proposed to explain some of its orbital characteristics.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force as described in passage A. According to passage A, disturbing forces may be one of the auxiliary premises needed to derive a theory's predictions that could lead to a failed prediction. The moon (choice E) is not relevant to this discussion since the passage is not related to the moon's movement. Uranus (choice A) is mentioned in the passage as being discovered and had an incorrect predicted orbit, but it is not an example of a disturbing force. The sun (choice B) is also not an example of a disturbing force in this context. Neptune (choice C), which was discovered based on the astronomical observations of Uranus, was not a disturbing force but was discovered as a result of the incorrect prediction of Uranus's orbit, which led astronomers to change their assumptions about the existence of other planets to better understand its orbit. Finally, Mercury (choice D) is a better example of a disturbing force because its orbit was not behaving as expected, requiring the hypothesis of an extra planet to explain some of its orbital characteristics.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how a prediction may fail due to "auxiliary premises," which involve other theories, instrumentation, or the absence of "disturbing forces." 
  Passage B describes how astronomers tried to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. One of the auxiliary assumption was that there were no planets near Uranus. When their prediction failed, they changed their assumption to include the existence of another planet, leading to the discovery of Neptune. They later hypothesized the existence of another planet (Vulcan) near Mercury, but it was never found until Einstein's theory of relativity was introduced. 
  A: Uranus is the planet whose orbit the astronomers were attempting to predict. It does not illustrate a disturbing force.
  B: The sun is one of the auxiliary premises used in the prediction of Uranus's orbit. While it may be a "disturbing force" to some extent, it is not a clear example of it.
  C: Neptune is the planet that the astronomers discovered due to the failure of their initial prediction of Uranus's orbit.
  D: Mercury is the planet whose orbit was predicted but did not match the observations until Einstein's theory of relativity was introduced.
  E: The moon is not mentioned in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  In passage A, the author speaks about the importance of searching for negative evidence and how Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not fully capture the actual situation that scientists face. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive, but negative evidence rarely is either. 
  Passage B gives two examples of how observations and calculations led to the discovery of two new celestial objects, Uranus and Neptune, and how calculations based on Einstein's general theory of relativity and auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
  A: Uranus is not an example of a disturbing force in this context.
  B: The sun is not an example of a disturbing force in this context.
  C: Neptune is not an example of a disturbing force in this context.
  D: Mercury could be an example of a disturbing force if its observed orbit did not match the predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  E: The moon is not an example of a disturbing force in this context.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Popper's theory regarding negative evidence, and the use of auxiliary premises in scientific theories.
  Passage B describes the discovery of Uranus and the subsequent hypothesis and search for another planet (Neptune), as well as the prediction and later correction of Mercury's orbit.
  Passage A refers to "disturbing forces" as one type of auxiliary premise that can contribute to incorrect predictions. 
  Choices A, B, C, D, and E are celestial objects mentioned in Passage B.
Action: Answer("E")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes the distinction between positive and negative evidence and how scientific research involves not only generating bold theories but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. The passage also notes that a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own and that there are usually more than one possible explanation when a prediction fails.
  Passage B discusses how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary premises but found discrepancies in their predictions. They hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they called Vulcan, in the vicinity of Mercury, but it was never found. Later, using Einstein's general theory of relativity, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary premises predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Action: Answer("D") 
The determination of the orbit of Mercury involves the use of additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, and to the absence of disturbing forces, as described in Passage A. The discrepancies in the predictions of the orbit of Mercury could be attributed to a disturbing force.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes Popper's interpretation of the power of negative evidence, and highlights the fact that a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. 
  Passage B describes how scientists have used auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbits of planets, and how they have modified these assumptions over time to account for new observations. It mentions that some scientists began to think that Newton's laws were in error because their predictions were not borne out.
  
Reasoning: Passage A defines a disturbing force as one of the "diverse additional 'auxiliary' premises" (line 30) that scientists use to make predictions. Passage B discusses auxiliary assumptions that astronomers used to predict the orbit of Uranus, and how they had to modify these assumptions to account for new observations. Therefore, we are looking for the entity in Passage B that might be considered a disturbing force according to the definition in Passage A.

A: Uranus is the planet that the astronomers were trying to predict the orbit of. It is not described as a disturbing force.
B: The sun is one of the auxiliary assumptions that astronomers used to make their calculations. It is not described as a disturbing force.
C: Neptune is the planet that astronomers discovered was necessary to account for the discrepancies in their predictions. It is not described as a disturbing force.
D: Mercury is the planet that astronomers used to test Newton's laws, and that was the subject of significant debate before Einstein's theory of relativity. While its orbit might be considered a disturbing force in some sense, it is not described as such in Passage A.
E: The moon is not mentioned in either passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?
Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.
  B: The primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers aud haudheld devices for reading text.
  C: The growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
  D: Any book will sell more copies ifit is published digitally thau if it is published traditionally.
  E: Digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that printing and binding digital books on demand will be more common than reading them on computer screens or handheld electronic devices.
  The author argues that digital publishing will be less expensive than traditional publishing due to the elimination of physical inventory and warehousing, shipping, and display costs.
  The author argues that literary agents will demand a larger share of revenue for their authors in the digital publishing model, as printing and distribution costs are absorbed by the authors.
  The author argues that established publishing houses will likely be reluctant to embrace the new digital model and that upstart digital-publishing firms may be the first to gain a foothold.

Action: Answer("A")  
Inference: The author argues that traditional publishers will need to adjust to the new digital publishing model or else they will lose their authors, suggesting that those publishers that fail to embrace the new model will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. Therefore, A is the best answer.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing is likely to eventually replace traditional publishing or at least become a strong competitor. Once most books are digitized, anyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practically limitless digital catalog that includes books that were once considered "out of print." Digital publishing will also be less expensive than traditional publishing because it eliminates the costs of physical inventory, warehousing, shipping, and displaying physical books in retail stores.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Reasoning: The author argues that traditional publishers, who are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, will initially be reluctant to embrace the digital model of publishing. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that those publishers who fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. Choice (B) is incorrect because the author argues that the capacity of instantaneous transmission and retrieval of digital text is a strength of digital publishing, not a threat. Choice (C) is incorrect because the author does not suggest that digital publishing will revitalize the book retail business. Choice (D) is incorrect because the author does not make a comparison between the sales of a book published digitally and a book published traditionally. Choice (E) is incorrect because the author does not provide any information on how digital publishing will affect the amount of money allocated for advertising their books.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
The passage describes a new digital model of publishing that is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing. Digital publishing eliminates the costs of printing, shipping, displaying, and returning physical books. It also provides a limitless digital catalog that includes books that are considered "out of print." The elimination of such costs may result in the authors being entitled to a larger share of the proceeds, which would make it difficult for traditional publishers, who are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, to compete with new digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors.

A: The passage states that traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. It does not directly state that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
B: The passage does not mention any primary threat to the spread of digital publishing.
C: The passage does not mention that the growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
D: The passage does not directly state that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally.
E: The passage does not mention that digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author suggests that most digital books will be printed on demand, eliminating the need for physical inventory, warehousing, shipping, and display costs.
  Digital publication will become more popular due to its economic efficiency and convenience.
  Established publishers will have to adjust to the new digital publishing model or risk losing authors to upstart digital-publishing firms.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Reasoning: The author notes that established publishers who are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing will be initially reluctant to embrace the new digital publishing model. The author also suggests that publishers who fail to adapt to the new model will lose their authors to upstart digital-publishing firms. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. Choice (A) is the best answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage argues that digital publishing is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing in terms of efficiency and convenience, and that established publishing houses will initially be reluctant to accede to this change. It also suggests that agents marketing new manuscripts could demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional, and that such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor.

Elimination:
  A: The passage does not state that publishers who fail to embrace digital publishing will become uncompetitive. It suggests that established publishers will be reluctant to accede to digital publishing, but it does not imply that they will necessarily become uncompetitive as a result.
  B: The passage does not suggest that the widespread use of computers and handheld devices for reading text will be the primary threat to the spread of digital publishing.
  C: The passage does not suggest that the growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business. It argues that digital publishing could lead to the displacement of printed books, and that anyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practically limitless digital catalog.
  D: The passage does not state that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally.
  E: The passage does not suggest that digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the new digital model of publishing will eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing; that digital publishing would be less expensive than traditional publishing; and that authors would be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds under the digital publishing model. 
A: The author argues that traditional publishers will eventually have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. It cannot be inferred from the passage, however, that they will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
B: The passage does not mention anything about the widespread use of computers or handheld devices being a threat to the spread of digital publishing. 
C: The passage does not mention anything about the growth of digital publishing revitalizing the book retail business.
D: The author argues that once most books have been digitized, anyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practically limitless digital catalog, but there is no suggestion that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally.
E: The author argues that the elimination of whole categories of expense means that under the digital publishing model, publishers could substantially decrease their costs, but there is no suggestion that it will allow them to decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that digital publishing will eventually replace or at least rival traditional publishing due to its economic efficiency and convenience, and that printed books can be made on demand at point of sale by machines that can make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in factories. 
  The author also argues that the elimination of whole categories of expense means that authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. 
A: The author argues that traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. So, it can be inferred that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. Thus, A is the correct answer.
B: The author identifies the widespread use of computers and handheld devices as a facilitator of digital publishing, not as a primary threat to its spread.
C: The passage does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
D: The passage does not support the claim that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally.
E: The passage does not provide any evidence to support the claim that digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing will eventually replace or at least rival traditional publishing due to its economic efficiency and convenience. Digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines, eliminating the costs of warehousing, transporting, and displaying physical books. Once most books have been digitized, anyone with access to the internet will be able to purchase printed books from a limitless catalog, including books that are traditionally "out of print." Under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Based on the argument presented, the author would most likely agree that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing will become more prevalent due to its economic efficiency and convenience for customers. Much of the costs of traditional publishing, such as printing, shipping, and displaying physical books are irrelevant to digital publication. As a result, traditional publishing houses may need to adjust their practices in order to remain competitive. One potential adjustment would be to increase royalty payments to authors. However, established publishing houses may initially be reluctant to embrace the new digital model. 
A: The author argues that traditional publishing houses may need to adjust their practices in order to remain competitive, which suggests that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing are unlikely to remain competitive. Therefore, this statement can be reasonably inferred from the passage. 
B: The author makes no mention of the use of computers and handheld devices as a potential threat to the spread of digital publishing. This statement cannot be reasonably inferred from the passage. 
C: The author does not discuss how the growth of digital publishing will affect the book retail business. This statement cannot be reasonably inferred from the passage. 
D: The author does not suggest that all books will sell more copies if published digitally than if published traditionally. This statement cannot be reasonably inferred from the passage. 
E: The author discusses how the costs of advertising physical books are irrelevant to digital publication. However, the author does not suggest that digital publishing will substantially decrease the amount of money publishers allocate for advertising their books. This statement cannot be reasonably inferred from the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage presents Dostoyevsky's views on the role of art in literature.
  A: This choice is incorrect because even though Dostoyevsky believed in the importance of the fantastic, the passage does not suggest that he considered it the only or most important element of art, nor does it suggest that he believed in the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  B: This choice is correct because Dostoyevsky believed that reality should be the foundation of literature, but he also believed that reality was more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life, and that there was no distinction in principle between reality and fantasy.
  C: This choice is incorrect because although Dostoyevsky believed that reality should be the foundation of literature, he did not believe that it should be the only foundation.
  D: This choice is correct because Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between reality and fantasy, so the view that art should be above the everyday is incorrect because it assumes such a distinction.
  E: This choice is correct because Dostoyevsky believed that literature should not be subject to a utilitarian requirement to further some societal end.
Action: Answer("E")

Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

Dostoyevsky is against the radical critics' requirement that art should serve a particular political view and must be useful to society as he believes that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear is a contradiction in terms. Therefore, it can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday, because of its insistence that art must further some societal end or be useful to people and society. Hence, the correct answer is E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

According to Dostoyevsky, the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world and within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns. Dostoyevsky believed that literary works should stand or fall on their "artistic merit" and fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to
Choices:
  A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life
  B: support the claim that Lichtenstein's work was parodic in intent
  C: contrast Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism
  D: suggest the emotions that lie at the heart of Lichtenstein's work
  E: endorse Lichtenstein's attitude toward consumer culture
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the themes and objects that influenced and appeared in Lichtenstein's paintings to describe his work as reflecting contemporary life and possessing a realistic impulse.
A: Choice A is correct, as the author mentions that Lichtenstein's paintings reflected the culture he inhabited and that the objects portrayed in the paintings were reflections of contemporary life. 
B: Choice B is incorrect, as the author describes Lichtenstein's work as possessing an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life, rather than simply being parodic in intent. 
C: Choice C is partly correct, as the author does mention abstract expressionism, but the main focus of the passage is on Lichtenstein and his work, rather than on comparing different approaches to art. 
D: Choice D is incorrect, as the author does not specifically mention the emotions at the heart of Lichtenstein's work, but rather focuses on the realism and nostalgia present in his paintings. 
E: Choice E is incorrect, as the author does not endorse Lichtenstein's attitude toward consumer culture, but rather describes it as a deliberate naivete in contrast to the jaded cynicism present in some other pop artists.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses Roy Lichtenstein's art and its relationship to pop art and abstract expressionism. The passage explains how Lichtenstein's paintings incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques and conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. It also describes Lichtenstein's work as displaying an impulse toward realism and an urge to depict contemporary life.
A: The author mentions the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings to highlight that they depict aspects of contemporary life.
B: The author does not support the claim that Lichtenstein's work was parodic in intent; instead, they acknowledge that his work was parodic but also conveyed a seriousness of theme and displayed an impulse toward realism.
C: The author contrasts Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism earlier in the passage; here, they are discussing the themes and objects that appear in Lichtenstein's paintings.
D: This choice is partially correct in that the passage describes Lichtenstein's work as conveying a seriousness of theme, but it does not describe the emotions at the heart of his work.
E: The author does not endorse Lichtenstein's attitude toward consumer culture; they describe his work as exhibiting "not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how Lichtenstein's work was part of a rebellion against abstract expressionism, and how his paintings were inspired by common objects and themes from popular culture, particularly comic books. It also highlights how Lichtenstein's work conveys both a satire of the art world and a serious engagement with contemporary life.

Action: Answer("A") 

Reasoning: 
  The author lists the themes and objects appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings in order to show that they depict aspects of contemporary life. This is evident from the context of the passage, which emphasizes how Lichtenstein's work was based on popular culture and how it reflected the culture of the time. While the author does acknowledge the parodic elements of Lichtenstein's work, this is not the primary purpose of the list. Furthermore, the list is not intended to contrast Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism, as this contrast is established earlier in the passage. The author also does not suggest the emotions that lie at the heart of Lichtenstein's work, as the focus is on the themes and objects depicted rather than the emotional content. Finally, while the passage does describe Lichtenstein's attitude toward consumer culture, the list is not intended to endorse this attitude.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how Lichtenstein merged popular and commercial art with fine art to create paintings that incorporated commonplace objects, comic books, and commercial-art techniques. The author presents Lichtenstein's work as a response to the excess of sophistication observed in abstract expressionism and some other pop artists. The paintings convey a serious theme that goes beyond parody. The author lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings, such as stylized figures, word balloons, simple black lines, and large areas of primary color, to show that what was missing from contemporary art was the depiction of contemporary life. The use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art but between parody and true feeling.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about the themes and objects that influenced and appeared in Lichtenstein's paintings.
  A: The passage says that Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
  B: The passage says that if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. But beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
  C: The passage talks about the rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, but it is not the primary purpose of listing the themes and objects.
  D: The passage does not suggest the emotions that lie at the heart of Lichtenstein's work. It says that Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody.
  E: The passage does not endorse or criticize Lichtenstein's attitude toward consumer culture.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author mentions the themes and objects present in Lichtenstein's paintings to provide insight into his artistic inspirations and intentions. The paintings show an impulse towards realism and a nostalgia that conveys an inner sweetness beneath the surface bravado. Lichtenstein imitated popular comic book genres to reflect the culture he inhabited and capture aspects of contemporary life.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage explains why some laws are not enforced by law enforcement agencies such as overinclusive laws that forbid some conduct that the legislature did not want to forbid, which could impose heavy social costs if strictly enforced. The passage argues that discretionary nonenforcement can be used as a technique to reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing the chances of underinclusion (loopholes). Although capricious enforcement is not rare, it is not the central tendency since legislative oversight ensures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a debate among legal scholars around the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, and the use of the economic principle of utility maximization as a way to reconcile the two positions.

  The passage discusses a crime deterrence debate between two legal scholar positions regarding the deterrence of deliberate crimes. One position argues that the best way to reduce the crime rate is by changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of crimes. The other position argues that the best way is to increase fines and penalties associated with criminal activity and to strengthen law enforcement. The passage introduces the utility maximization principle, which holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. Using this principle, the decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. The passage then argues that both of the legal scholar positions regarding crime deterrence can be seen as affecting the utility equation in different ways, and therefore, both positions have the same overall effect.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The passage describes how legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to analyze the decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. This is similar to a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. Both of these scenarios involve the use of principles from another field to support a position in a legal or social context.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle and how it reconciles the two positions in the crime deterrence debate by showing that the two positions actually complement each other.
  A: This choice is about an astronomer using a metaphor for an observed phenomenon.
  B: This choice is about a drawing instructor using a physical law to demonstrate an optical illusion.
  C: This choice is about a botanist using a quote from an Olympic athlete to make a point about plants.
  D: This choice is about a judge using evidence from anthropology in a legal case.
  E: This choice is about a mediator using a quote from a novel to set the tone of a meeting.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes a debate within the legal community over the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  Legal scholars are divided between those who believe that societal norms and institutions influence individuals to commit such crimes, and those who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice.
  An economic principle, utility maximization, can reconcile these two positions by showing that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  This framework can be used to analyze crimes as rational economic choices.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  Option A is dissimilar from the situation described in the passage as it describes an astronomer's use of a paradox to help them to explain a recent observed phenomenon.
  Option B is dissimilar from the situation described in the passage as it describes a drawing instructor's use of the law of optics to demonstrate that seemingly diverging lines that are drawn on paper are actually parallel.
  Option C is dissimilar from the situation described in the passage as it describes a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest.
  Option D is the correct answer as it describes a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. Just as in the passage, the judge uses a principle from another field to support legal arguments.
  Option E is dissimilar from the situation described in the passage as it describes a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  A: This choice is unrelated to the passage's discussion of the utility maximization principle and crime deterrence.
  B: This choice is unrelated to the passage's discussion of the utility maximization principle and crime deterrence.
  C: This choice is unrelated to the passage's discussion of the utility maximization principle and crime deterrence.
  D: This choice is not incorrect per se, however, it is a very broad sense answer. The passage does not point to any evidence from anthropology to support a legal case. In addition, the answer does not directly relate to the utility maximization principle and crime deterrence.
  E: This choice is unrelated to the passage's discussion of the utility maximization principle and crime deterrence.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the different perspectives of two groups of legal scholars, those who believe that societal norms and institutions influence individuals' decisions to commit deliberate crimes, and those who believe that it is primarily an individual choice. 
  The passage further introduces the economic principle of utility maximization, which suggests that deterrence methods that increase the cost or decrease the benefit of criminal activity can effectively lower the expected utility of such activity, thus deterring individuals from committing crimes.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Knowledge:  
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the processes by which it was discovered. The discovery was made over a period of years, with various scientists contributing to the accumulation of evidence. Theoretical calculations played a role in the development of the idea, but the experimental evidence was initially misinterpreted or overlooked.

A: The fact that the physicists used the same research techniques does not have an obvious connection to the discovery of nuclear fission. The problem with recognizing nuclear fission had more to do with the interpretation of the results than with the techniques used to obtain those results. Therefore, A cannot be the correct answer.
B: The passage suggests that the physicists did have expectations about the nuclear composition of the by-products, and that these expectations were an obstacle to recognizing the significance of the results. If the physicists had not had these expectations, it is possible that they would have recognized the significance of the results more quickly. Therefore, B is the correct answer.
C: The passage notes that some theoretical physicists had already calculated that it would be possible to split atoms before the discovery of nuclear fission. The fact that the physicists who conducted the experiments were not aware of these calculations does not seem to have been a major factor in their difficulty recognizing what was happening in the experiments. Therefore, C is not the correct answer.
D: The passage suggests that many physicists did attempt to obtain experimental results from neutron bombardment of uranium. The fact that more physicists had concentrated on obtaining such results would not necessarily have led to a quicker recognition of the significance of those results. Therefore, D is not the correct answer.
E: The passage mainly focuses on the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium, and does not provide information about experiments conducted with other substances. The discovery of nuclear fission was made specifically through the study of uranium, and it is not clear that experiments with other substances would have been more illuminating. Therefore, E is not the correct answer.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission between 1934 and 1939 without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  In 1939, Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, recognizing that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The passage states that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart "even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated." Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had been aware of these calculations, they might have realized that they were witnessing nuclear fission more quickly. Choice C correctly states that the physicists were not aware of the calculations indicating that it was possible to split atoms, so if they had been aware of these calculations, they might have made the conceptual link sooner.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the discovery of nuclear fission, which happened between 1934 and 1939.
  Physicists at the time were performing experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium and were able to gather evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but they were not able to recognize what they had discovered until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and coined the term "nuclear fission."
  The passage suggests that the right conceptual link was the main factor that was missing for physicists to realize they were splitting atoms.
  
A: This information does not seem relevant to the question of how physicists could have realized they were splitting atoms more quickly.
B: This choice seems plausible as the passage mentions that scientists had a certain expectation that the by-products of the neutron bombardment would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
C: This choice is unlikely because the passage mentions that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
D: This information does not seem relevant to the question of how physicists could have realized they were splitting atoms more quickly.
E: This information does not seem relevant to the question of how physicists could have realized they were splitting atoms more quickly.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how physicists compiled increasing evidence between 1934 and 1939 that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  The researchers were not receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in the context of their experiments.
  Lise Meitner, who was conducting related research, recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. 
  Meitner quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with physicist Otto Frisch. 
  When scientists rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: If the physicists had not had particular expectations regarding the nuclear composition of the by-products, they may have been more open to considering the possibility that nuclear fission was occurring. This could have led to a quicker recognition of what was happening. Choice A is incorrect because the use of the same research techniques is not directly relevant to the question of recognizing nuclear fission. Choice C is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that a lack of physicists obtaining experimental results was the cause of the delay in recognizing nuclear fission. Choice E is also incorrect because the passage focuses specifically on neutron bombardment of uranium.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The discovery of "nuclear fission," the process by which the nuclei of atoms could be split, took some time to recognize by scientists conducting experiments related to neutron bombardment of uranium. Even though increasing evidence was being amassed, researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.In 1939, Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection and recognized the significance of the data and was able to coin the term "nuclear fission." 
A: The passage does not provide any information about the research techniques used by the physicists, so we cannot determine if the answer would be correct or not. 
B: The passage states that researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in that context, and did not recognize what they were witnessing, so this answer is incorrect. 
C: The passage states that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it was possible to break atoms apart in principle before nuclear fission was discovered through neutron-bombardment of uranium, so this answer is incorrect. 
D: The passage does not suggest that a greater concentration on obtaining experimental results would have led to a faster recognition of nuclear fission, so this answer is incorrect.
E: The passage does not provide any information about neutron bombardment experiments involving substances other than uranium, so we cannot determine if the answer would be correct or not. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission.
  The identification of barium as a substance resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium was a surprising result because it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics."
  The chemical products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and coined the term "nuclear fission."
  
Answer Analysis:
  A: The fact that scientists were using the same techniques of research does not necessarily imply that they would be able to identify the significance of the data any faster.
  B: This choice is contrary to the information given in the passage, which states that the products remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  C: The passage states that some theoretical physicists had already produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  D: This choice is too vague and does not provide any specific information that would have directly led to a quicker identification of nuclear fission.
  E: This choice is irrelevant because it does not involve neutron bombardment of uranium, which is the key factor in the discovery of nuclear fission.
 
Therefore, None of the choices is the best answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the time leading up to its recognition.
  Physicists had been conducting experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium and had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Researchers were not initially receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in that context.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection connecting the experimental data to the underlying theoretical considerations.
  It was not until after Meitner's realization that other scientists corroborated the finding.

A: The passage does not provide information on the techniques used by physicists conducting the experiments, and it is unlikely that a change in techniques would have directly led to a quicker realization of nuclear fission.
B: The passage mentions that the physicists were not expecting the by-products to be other elements, but this did not prevent them from recognizing nuclear fission. 
C: The passage mentions that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. This suggests that awareness of these calculations would not have directly led to quicker recognition of nuclear fission.
D: The passage does not suggest that the amount of physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results was a limiting factor in the recognition of nuclear fission.
E: The passage does not provide information on the effect of neutron bombardment of other substances on the recognition of nuclear fission.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:

Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: 
  The passage does not suggest that the physicists could have discovered nuclear fission by changing the substances they tested. Hence, eliminating this answer leaves us with the four choices. 
  
  A: The passage does not suggest that the research techniques used by the physicists had any impact on their ability to recognize the process of nuclear fission.
  
  B: The passage suggests that the physicists did have expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, and that these expectations hindered their ability to identify the by-products as elements significantly different from uranium. Hence, this answer choice does not reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize nuclear fission.
  
  C: The passage suggests that theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. Therefore, it is unlikely that if the physicists conducting the experiments had been aware of these calculations, they would have been more likely to recognize nuclear fission.
  
  D: The passage does not suggest that a different group of physicists or more physicists would have made a difference in recognizing nuclear fission. 
  
  E: This answer choice provides new information not mentioned in the passage. If physicists had conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium, they might have been able to recognize nuclear fission earlier.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
The passage describes the historical discovery of nuclear fission and how the physicists conducting the experiments compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing. The passage indicates that the researchers had not been receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms, and their expectations about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products had hampered their identification of the products.
A: The passage does not provide sufficient information to determine whether this would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Three positions are presented and each is elaborated in detail.
  B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  C: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the second in detail.
  D: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be superior to the first two.
  E: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be inferior to the second.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage presents three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism, but the emphasis is on how Dostoyevsky differentiates himself from the first two positions. The passage describes the first two positions in the first paragraph, elaborating on the differences between them. In the second paragraph, the passage explains how Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality goes deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, and how he differentiates himself from the first two positions. The passage then moves on to describe Dostoevsky's view on the artistic merit of a literary work and the utilitarian claim that a literary work must serve a particular political view, without explicitly stating any superiority or inferiority between the three positions. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the material is that three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage presents three positions in Russian literary criticism and focuses on the third position presented by Dostoyevsky. The first two positions are briefly mentioned and contrasted with Dostoyevsky's position. Therefore, option B, which states that three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail, is the most accurate description of the organization of the material presented in the passage.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage presents three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. The first two positions are elaborated to explain their emphasis on either art's high standing or its usefulness. Conversely, the third position, which is Dostoyevsky's position, is differentiated from the first two in detail, and it is explained how his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage presents three positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time:
  - The first position maintains that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
  - The second position maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful.
  - Dostoyevsky took a third position, which is different from the first two. He believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. He believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. He exploded the boundaries of the so-called real world and believed that the fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it. He rejected the radical critics' claim that art must serve a particular political view and be useful at all costs to people and society. He believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:

Explanation:
The passage presents three positions, two of which are opposing and one of which is distinct from the other two. The passage primarily focuses on detailing the third position, which is Dostoyevsky's position, and contrasting it to the first two. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the material presented in the passage is that three positions are presented, and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail, which is option B.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage discusses three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time. The first two positions are briefly explained while the third one, which is Dostoyevsky's position, is elaborated in detail and differentiated from the first two. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage presents three positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time, but it focuses on the third position and how it differs from the first two. The third position is elaborated in more detail as a realist approach that goes deeper into the understanding of reality and the role of the writer in exploring the fantastic within the real. The first two positions are briefly described as the idea of art being above everyday reality and the radical view that art should only exist if it found its sources in concrete reality and served a particular political view. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage presents three different positions on the role of literature and art, but it places the most emphasis on Dostoyevsky's position, which is explained in more detail than the other two.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B describe opposing views regarding evolutionary psychology.
  The author of Passage B thinks that evolutionary psychology is like a "conspiracy theory".
  The author of Passage A describes the evolutionary basis of behavior, including apparent altruism.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes evolutionary psychology and how it explains certain human behaviors, such as altruistic acts.
  Passage B uses the phrase "conspiracy theory" to describe evolutionary psychology's explanation of behavior by imputing an interest (proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior is not aware of.
  A, B, and E describe evolutionary psychology and its approach to human behavior, but they do not exemplify what the author of Passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  C describes a behavior that evolutionary psychology seeks to explain, but it does not exemplify what the author of Passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A discusses the theory of evolutionary psychology, which explains human behavior from the theory of evolution.
  The passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of.

Action: Answer("D")  
The passage A asserts that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, which exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory," as genes are conspiring to propagate themselves through seemingly unselfish human behavior that is not openly acknowledged or aware.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology seeks to explain human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution using identification and empathy. It argues that self-propagation of genes may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish, potentially giving rise to apparently altruistic behavior.  
  Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a kind of conspiracy theory because it assumes that the agent of a behavior has an interest (the proliferation of genes) that they do not acknowledge.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author of passage A uses evolutionary psychology to explain that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  The author of passage B calls evolutionary psychology a kind of conspiracy theory by explaining that an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A examines how the evolutionary theory can explain a given type of human behavior.
  It explains that altruistic behavior is thorny and could be accounted for by the psychological experiences of identification and empathy.
  These experiences could have arisen in response to cues that indicated the presence of shared genetic material between individuals.
  Psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance.
  This would enhance the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy.
  Passage B claims that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory, explaining behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
  The explanation of behavior based on gene proliferation may not be the only explanation, as there are other interests that could explain the same behavior.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains how the theory of evolution can be used to explain human behavior from the standpoint of genes.
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of.
  A: This assertion explains the approach taken by evolutionary psychology but does not exemplify it as a "conspiracy theory."
  B: This assertion is presented as a problem that evolutionary psychology must address.
  C: This assertion describes a behavior but does not exemplify the "conspiracy theory" mentioned in passage B.
  D: This assertion exemplifies the "conspiracy theory" because genes promote their own self-propagation through instinctive actions that appear unselfish, and this behavior may not always be recognized by the agent as being in the service of the genes.
  E: This assertion describes the living situation of early humans, but does not exemplify the "conspiracy theory" mentioned in passage B.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology examines human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution by explaining how identification and empathy initially arise in response to cues that indicate the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The states provoked by these cues increase the chances of related individuals receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. The mechanisms of altruism may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. 
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a kind of conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. 
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains that evolutionary psychology examines human behavior in terms of contributing to the reproductive success of individuals and the proliferation of genetic material. It mentions that altruism presents a challenge for this theory and offers one possible explanation for its evolution: psychological experiences of identification and empathy. The passage suggests that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish. 
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it imputes an interest (proliferation of genes) to the individual that they may not be aware of. It argues that interests other than self-propagation of genes could explain behavior that is attributed to it in evolutionary psychology. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The question is asking us to identify an assertion from Passage A that exemplifies the label "conspiracy theory" that the author of Passage B applies to evolutionary psychology.
  According to Passage B, evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or even aware of.
  A: This assertion describes a method or approach that evolutionary psychologists use, but does not connect with the label "conspiracy theory" in Passage B.
  B: This assertion describes a problem of evolution that evolutionary psychologists need to explain, but does not connect with the label "conspiracy theory" in Passage B.
  C: This assertion describes an altruistic behavior, but does not connect with the label "conspiracy theory" in Passage B.
  D: This assertion suggests that genes can promote their self-propagation through apparently unselfish actions, which connects with the label "conspiracy theory" in Passage B.
  E: This assertion describes an aspect of early human society, but does not connect with the label "conspiracy theory" in Passage B.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of studying Native American autobiographies that were written down by non-Native American collaborators, but overlook traditional modes of communicating personal history. Such written documents emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
  A: This choice is incorrect because it describes a work that is more artifact-based than written and does not involve collaboration by members of different cultures.
  B: This choice is incorrect because it describes a situation in which two people contribute in the same way to the finished product. The passage suggests that the European collaborator often played a dominant role in shaping the work.
  C: This choice is incorrect because it describes a composite work that is based only on written documents. The passage describes Native American autobiographical modes of expression that are not written.
  D: This choice is correct because it describes the situation in which a Native American collaborator tells his or her story to a non-Native American interviewer, and the resulting document is edited and revised by a non-Native American collaborator.
  E: This choice is incorrect because it describes the situation in which a Native American collaborator's story is written down by a non-Native American collaborator. The passage suggests that such written documents are limited and often fail to capture the traditional modes of expressing personal history of Native American cultures.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage defines "bicultural composite authorship" as a process of creating written documents through collaboration between Native American and non-Native American authors. The resulting documents are "as-told-to life histories" that focus on personal history and experiences. The passage also notes that this approach overlooks traditional and preliterate modes of personal history communication within Native American cultures.
A: This choice does not accurately describe "bicultural composite authorship" as defined in the passage.
B: This choice does not accurately describe "bicultural composite authorship" as defined in the passage.
C: This choice does not accurately describe "bicultural composite authorship" as defined in the passage.
D: This choice accurately describes "bicultural composite authorship" as defined in the passage.
E: This choice does not accurately describe "bicultural composite authorship" as defined in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes scholars' study of autobiographies of Native Americans that have traditionally been captured through "bicultural composite authorship". 
  The meaning of the term "bicultural composite authorship" has not been explicitly stated in the passage.
  The passage states that the "autobiographies" studied by the scholars are as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. 
  
Action: Answer("B")  
  The passage states that most scholars have focused on "as-told-to" life histories of Native Americans, that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship" since the Native American culture did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography". The term "bicultural composite authorship" implies that two or more individuals (each belonging to a different culture) have contributed to the creation of the finished product- the autobiography. Choice B accurately conveys this meaning.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how scholars have focused on "as-told-to life histories" which were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. These life histories were the results of "bicultural composite authorship," which refers to the collaboration between a Native American and a non-Native American to create a written work. 
  A: This choice describes a work based on artifacts and oral traditions, but does not specify that it involves collaboration between members of different cultures.
  B: This choice describes a collaboration between two people from different cultures, but it does not specify that the finished product is a written work.
  C: This choice is not supported by the passage.
  D: This choice accurately describes the meaning of "bicultural composite authorship."
  E: This choice describes a work based on oral communication, but it does not specify that it involves collaboration between members of different cultures.

Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is introduced in the context of discussing the autobiographies of Native Americans. Such autobiographies are usually written with the help of non-Native American collaborators and are considered to be a product of collaboration.
  A: This choice does not mention bicultural composite authorship. Although it refers to a collaboration, it is not necessarily bicultural.
  B: This choice is consistent with the meaning of bicultural composite authorship as a collaboration of two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes to the finished product.
  C: This choice does not mention bicultural composite authorship or any collaboration at all.
  D: This choice describes a collaboration between members of different cultures, one of whom edits the work of the other, which is consistent with bicultural composite authorship.
  E: This choice does not mention bicultural composite authorship.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  "Bicultural composite authorship" refers to a specific type of written documents.
  Most scholars studying Native American autobiographies have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  Such written documents emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
Action: Answer("D") 
According to the sentence "bicultural composite authorship" refers to as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. They were written originally by a member of one culture (the Native American people who narrated their life stories) but edited and revised by a member of another culture (the non-Native American collaborators who wrote them down). Therefore, the most accurate choice is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage is discussing the autobiographies of Native Americans, and how most scholars have focused on written documents that were created through collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators, resulting in a "bicultural composite authorship."

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: Passage A discusses two phenomena (habituation and rivalry) that push up the norm for income levels and ultimately affect happiness. It also emphasizes that people compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. The study by Solnick and Hemenway is then presented as evidence that people's relative position to their "reference group" is crucial for happiness. Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. It presents the idea that wanting to create value benefits society, and that it also brings happiness.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the paradox of happiness and wealth, and how people's perception of their income depends on social comparison (habituation and rivalry).

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.
  C: It forms part of a speculative hypothesis that the author presents for its interest in relation to the main topic rather than as part of an argument.
  D: It serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
  E: It forms part of the author's concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how technological developments have served as a democratizing force, narrowing the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people in the long term, and how entrepreneurs and investors are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, structuring their prices to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: The reference to maximization of financial success serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development and the tendency of the market system to diffuse access to new technology across society.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage argues that the market system and its ability to enable entrepreneurs and investors to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital is a democratizing force that narrows the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various technological developments which have gradually diffused benefits across society as a result. Specifically, entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population.
  
Analysis:
  The question asks for the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success. That reference appears in lines 52-54 and says, "Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market." Going back to the passage, we can see that the author is using this statement to explain how market competition drives prices down and tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result. Therefore, the reference serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The paragraph highlights the democratizing effects of technological developments on society under the market system.
  It argues that the profit motive of entrepreneurs and investors leads them to expand their market, making their technologies accessible to an ever-larger share of the population, ultimately diffusing access to new technology across society through market competition.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
The reference to maximization of financial success supports the argument that the profit motive of entrepreneurs and investors drives expansion of their market, resulting in the diffusion of access to new technology across society through market competition. Therefore, it serves as a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development. Choice (D) accurately represents this role of the reference.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The author is discussing how technological developments have served as a democratizing force.
- The market system has played a role in diffusing access to new technology across society by driving prices down and expanding the market.
- The paragraph in question discusses how entrepreneurs and investors are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market and making their technologies accessible to a larger share of the population.

Action: Answer("D")  
The reference to maximization of financial success reinforces the causal explanation of the author's thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development. The paragraph in question explains how entrepreneurs and investors are incentivized to expand their market and make their technologies accessible to a larger share of the population, which is a causal explanation of how the market system contributes to the democratizing force of technological developments.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how technological developments have served as a democratizing force and narrowed the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people under the market system.

  The passage discusses the gradual diffusion of benefits across society as a result of the general tendency of the market system.
Action: Answer("D")  
The primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52-54) is to serve as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development. The author argues that the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, but they are unable to do so without structuring their prices to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. This tendency of the market system helps to narrow the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people and serves overall as a democratizing force.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives
  E: eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk and how it relates to judgments about risk. The author argues that this distinction is often based on confusion and selective attention, and that it is not a reliable guide for policy. The author suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can while taking into account limited resources and specific considerations.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 1:
Knowledge: The author discusses the way people tend to categorize risks based on whether they are voluntary or not, and that people have a tendency to misunderstand and confuse the concept of voluntariness. The author suggests that policy regarding risk management should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness and not rely solely on that criterion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the difference between lay and expert judgments about risk, focusing on the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk. The author argues that, despite the public's tendency to view voluntary risks as less in need of government intervention, there is no clear line between voluntary and involuntary risks, and judgments about voluntariness are often influenced by other factors. The author suggests that government policy should be guided by a more nuanced understanding of risk, and that the primary criterion for government intervention should be saving as many lives as possible given limited resources. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the difference between lay and expert judgments about risks, the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks, and the author's belief that policy decisions should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. The author is critical of laypeople's judgments about risks but does not necessarily reject the notion of voluntariness as a factor in determining government policy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. The author also claims that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary."  Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the difficulties with using the concepts of "voluntary" and "involuntary" to guide policy decisions regarding risk management.

The author also expresses skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's judgments about risk.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the differences between expert and lay judgments about risk, particularly in terms of whether a risk is incurred voluntarily. The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "voluntary" are of little utility in guiding policy decisions, and that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. The author also argues that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. 
Action: Answer("C") 
The author expresses skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the difference between lay and expert judgments about risk and the difficulties in determining when a risk is voluntary.
  It suggests that characterizations of risks as "voluntary" or "involuntary" are of little utility in guiding policy decisions and that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses the concerns raised by some researchers about access to research materials, such as cell lines, that have been patented by corporations, and the restrictions that may be placed on basic research that uses such materials. The article also asserts that granting a patent does not necessarily imply granting the right to deny access, and that there is a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement that may provide protection for researchers who use patented materials in their work. 
A: The article argues that this outcome is unlikely, as there is a tradition among judges to respect a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement, and because the expense of patent litigation usually makes it an unattractive option for patent holders except in cases where their market position is threatened.
B: This outcome is also unlikely, for the reasons discussed above.
C: The article does not suggest that the university would necessarily prohibit the research.
D: This is the most likely outcome, according to the article's discussion of the noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
E: The article does not suggest that the corporation would necessarily offer to fund the research.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in patent holders' attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. 
  The passage also states that scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials and that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable.
  The passage further suggests that patents provide scientists with an incentive to innovate.
Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the passage, the author is most likely to predict that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued. While the corporation holding the patent may demand a prohibitively high payment for the use of the cell lines, or could offer to fund the research in exchange for exclusive marketable rights, the passage suggests that enforcing a patent against a researcher conducting basic, noncommercial research is not a common practice and that judges have respected a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. The passage also notes that patents can provide scientists with an incentive to innovate. Therefore, the best prediction is that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the debate over the patenting of biotechnology inventions and its impact on basic research. 
  The passage notes that some fear that patent holders may restrict access to research materials or charge high fees for their use; however, the author argues that the fear of such restrictions may be overstated and that patents can actually incentivize research.
  The author notes that there is a tradition of judges respecting a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
Action: Answer("D") 
According to the passage, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued. The passage suggests that judges often respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement, and that patent litigation is usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses concerns about restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals, and the impact of biotechnology patents on basic research. The passage argues that basic, noncommercial research is typically not hampered by patents and that patents actually provide incentives for innovation.
A: The passage argues against this prediction by suggesting that it is unlikely that the corporation would charge prohibitively high fees for noncommercial research involving its patented cell lines.
B: The passage argues against this prediction by suggesting that courts have generally respected a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement and that patent litigation is an expensive endeavor that corporations are less likely to pursue in such cases.
C: The passage does not support this prediction.
D: This prediction is most consistent with the passage's argument that patents do not typically hinder basic, noncommercial research and that courts have generally recognized an exception to patent infringement for such research.
E: The passage does not address this prediction.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage mentions that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement, and that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  
Action: Answer("D")   
According to the information provided in the passage, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued, as there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.

  A: The author argues that it is unlikely that the corporation holding the patent will demand prohibitively high payment for the use of the cell lines, and that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate, which would include making their discoveries available to others for non-commercial research purposes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the researcher will be unable to use the cell lines because of high cost.
  B: The author argues that enforcing a patent against a researcher conducting noncommercial research is unlikely. Therefore, it is unlikely that the corporation holding the patent will successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The passage does not provide any information to suggest that the university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The author argues that patent litigation is usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee and that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The passage does not provide any information to suggest that the corporation holding the patent will offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The article discusses the perceived threat to basic research arising from restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. The restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. However, the author argues that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable.

Action: Answer("D")  
According to the article, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued because of the tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
Response 8:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

Action: Answer("D") 
According to the passage, the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because the method creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  The subtractive method involves subtracting a baseline measurement (the control condition) from a measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task, with the resulting image interpreted as a map of metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  The author critiques the modular theory of mind and argues that the mind and brain may not be decomposable into independent modules instantiated in localized brain regions, but rather are likely to involve distributed brain functions.
  The author suggests that the subtractive method, which creates an illusion of neat functional localization, may be attractive because it seems to support the modular theory of mind.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the subtractive method of analyzing brain scans.
  The method involves taking two measurements: one in a control condition and one while the subject performs a cognitive task, and then subtracting the control measurement from the active measurement to produce an image.
  The passage argues that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and that the modular theory of mind, which holds that mental processes can be decomposed into distinct modules instantiated in separate brain regions, may not be accurate.
Action: Answer("D") 
The author argues that the subtractive method creates an illusion of neat functional localization in the brain that supports the modular theory of mind, but that this localization may not be accurate given that the entire brain is active in both conditions. Choice D accurately captures the author's view.
Response 3:
Knowledge:

Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method to study the brain's response to various cognitive tasks, and challenges the assumption of modular theory of mind which claims that the brain can be analyzed into independent modules in specific regions. The passage also describes the method of subtractive imaging, which is a way of highlighting the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during specific cognitive tasks. 

A: This statement contradicts the critique of the modular theory of mind presented in the passage. The passage argues that it may not be valid to assume that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain. 
B: This statement is not supported by the passage. The passage does not discuss the modular theory of mind in terms of how regions of the brain are engaged in specific cognitive tasks, nor does it suggest that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero. 
C: This statement is supported by the passage. The passage describes the FMRI method of subtractive imaging, which produces images of differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain during the performance of a cognitive task. 
D: This statement is not supported by the passage. The passage describes the baseline measurements of oxygen use as a method of subtractive imaging, but it does not suggest that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. 
E: This statement is not directly supported by the passage. While the passage mentions the example of anger as a cognitive task that may not be separable from other processes like reason-giving, it does not specifically mention how the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" during an experience of anger. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology to study the modular theory of mind, which suggests that distinct mental modules are located in localized regions of the brain.
  The passage also discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to create brain scan images of cognitive tasks. This method subtracts baseline measurements of brain activity from on-task measurements to create images that show the differential rate of oxygen use during a cognitive task in specific regions of the brain.
  The passage critiques the modular theory of mind, arguing that mental processes are likely not decomposable into independent modules, and that brain scans may not accurately reflect this theory.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 2:
Knowledge:
 The passage describes the use of neuroimaging, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), as a research method which depends on the premise of the modular theory of mind. This theory posits that mental activity can be broken down into separate components which are instantiated in localized brain regions. The passage goes on to suggest that this modular theory may not entirely hold true, and that the brain may be more globally active than previously thought. The passage further describes the subtractive method used in FMRI research, where a baseline measurement of brain activity is subtracted from the measurement taken during a cognitive task to determine the activity specific to that task.

A: The passage suggests that the validity of the modular theory of mind, which claims that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain, is uncertain. The passage also states that different mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. Therefore, this statement is not strongly supported by the passage. 

B: The passage does not suggest that the modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero. 

C: The passage describes the use of the subtractive method in FMRI research, where areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during a specific cognitive task are identified by subtracting the baseline measurements taken during a control condition. Therefore, this statement is strongly supported by the passage. 

D: The passage describes the use of baseline measurements of brain activity as part of the subtractive method used in FMRI research. However, it does not suggest that these measurements show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. 

E: The passage does not specifically mention anger as a cognitive task, nor does it provide specific examples of which brain regions are active during the experience of anger. Therefore, this statement cannot be strongly supported by the passage. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans and the modular theory of mind to study mental activity.
  FMRI's are used to measure the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The modular theory of mind is not universally accepted and may not accurately reflect mental processes.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The passage states that during the subtractive method baseline measurements of oxygen use are taken, which implies that there are regions of the brain with high metabolic activity at all times. Therefore, the statement that "The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times" is most strongly supported by the passage.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the modular theory of mind. The modular theory of mind is a premise that modules of the brain are responsible for specific cognitive functions. The use of the subtractive method in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is also discussed. The method is used to determine the metabolic activity associated solely with a cognitive task by subtracting a baseline measurement taken in a control condition from a measurement taken while the task is being performed.
  
A: The passage provides reasons to doubt the validity of the modular theory of mind and suggests that the entire brain is active in both the control and cognitive task conditions. 
B: The passage does not address whether regions of the brain not engaged in a cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use close to zero. 
C: The passage states that the areas of the brain most metabolically active during certain cognitive tasks show a higher rate of oxygen use than the rest of the brain. 
D: The passage does not provide information on whether some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. 
E: The passage does not specifically mention anger or "several regions of the brain" lighting up. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology as a research method. The modular theory of mind is introduced as the premise upon which this method depends, and is contrasted with the view that mental activity is distributed throughout the brain. The passage explains that functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) produces images of localized brain activity via the subtractive method. The method subtracts baseline measurements of metabolic activity in the brain from measurements taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
A: The passage does not provide support for this statement. Although the modular theory of mind is presented as a premise, the critique of this theory suggests that it may not be fully accurate. The idea that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain is not discussed.
B: The passage does not support this statement. The passage explains that the method used to produce functional brain scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement of brain activity from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task. Neither measurement should show a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
C: The passage supports this statement. The passage explains that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
D: The passage does not provide support for this statement. The passage explains that the baseline measurements used in the subtractive method do not show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
E: The passage does not support this statement. While the example of anger is mentioned, the passage does not specify whether several regions of the brain are "lit up" with metabolic activity in this case.
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology.
  The modular theory of mind is the premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain, and not distinct entities or modules.
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a method that subtracts out all the distributed brain functions to produce a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The passage states that the FMRI produces a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, and that the subtractive method used in FMRI subtracts out all distributed brain functions to produce a map of metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. Therefore, during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. Choice C is the correct answer.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the validity of using neuroimaging in psychology research.
  Brain scans are different when used in medical diagnosis and in psychology research.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise that assumes the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules or components instantiated in localized brain regions.
  Critiques of the modular theory of mind suggest that psychological processes may not be decomposable into independent modules.
  Brain scans, particularly FMRI, reveal well-defined areas that "light up" during cognitive tasks, but the subtractive method used in FMRI produces a false impression of neat functional localization.

Action: Answer("D") 

The statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is that the baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. This is discussed in the passage when it points out that the entire brain is active in both conditions and that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. Therefore, none of the specific regions of the brain have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging (specifically, functional magnetic resonance imaging or FMRI) in psychology research and the modular theory of mind. 
  The modular theory of mind posits that the mind can be broken down into individual modules or components that are located in specific regions of the brain.
  FMRI is a subtractive method that is used to map the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI subtraction method is used to identify areas of metabolic activity that are associated with a specific cognitive task.
  The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind may not be a valid way of understanding mental processes. 

Analysis:
  Option A contradicts the passage's suggestion that the modular theory of mind may not be an accurate way of understanding mental processes.
  Option B is not discussed in the passage. 
  Option C accurately describes the use of FMRI in identifying areas of metabolic activity associated with specific cognitive tasks.
  Option D discusses baseline measurements but does not accurately describe them. The passage states that the entire brain is active in both conditions. 
  Option E is not discussed in the passage. 

Action: Answer("C")

Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.

  A: The passage suggests that both paintings and perfume can evoke memories, but does not argue that evoking memories is a necessary feature of all art.
  B: The passage describes how both paintings and perfume involve the combination of many small sensations, but does not argue that this is a necessary feature of all art.
  C: The passage critiques the commercialization of perfume, but does not argue that commercial success is inherently detrimental to art.
  D: The passage mentions that oil paintings can become more transparent over time, but does not argue that this is a necessary feature of all art.
  E: The passage argues that perfume deserves to be taken seriously within the art world, suggesting that it is on par with other forms of art. The passage does not suggest that any one form of art is superior to another.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses oil paintings and perfumes as two art forms that share similarities in their creation and impact on the senses.
  The author argues that great perfume is not taken seriously enough by art professionals, perhaps due to its association with the cosmetic industry.
  The author suggests that perfumery, like painting and music, can create an imaginary world that evokes memories and emotions.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between the process of creating oil paintings and the process of creating perfumes. The author argues that perfumes should be taken more seriously as a form of art and that great perfumes can stimulate memories and emotions similar to other forms of art. The author also criticizes the current state of the perfume industry, suggesting that it undervalues truly great scents in favor of cheaper, less authentic formulas.
A: The passage mentions that perfumers are in the same business as artists who create the illusion of life on canvas and that talented "noses" can produce combinations of scents that recall memories or experiences. However, the passage does not suggest that this is the only way in which a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience.
B: The passage suggests that talented perfumers can experiment with complex combinations of olfactory elements to create a symphony of scents. However, the passage does not suggest that this is the only way in which one can detect the harmonious combination of small sensations in a work of art.
C: While the passage does criticize the current state of the perfume industry and its focus on profits over quality, it does not make the broad claim that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for commercial success.
D: The passage discusses how oil paintings change over time as the oil paint becomes gradually more transparent. However, it does not suggest that the best works of art necessarily improve with age.
E: The passage does not argue that some forms of art are superior to others.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume-making as "sister arts", emphasizing the similar level of skill needed to curate and appreciate both. The author argues that perfumery is undervalued due to corporate interests that have led to the degradation of formulas and the exchange of quality for cheaper, more profitable ingredients.
  
Analysis:
  A: The passage briefly touches on the idea that perfumes can evoke memories, but this is not the main focus of the passage and is not presented as a general statement about art.
  B: This choice describes the parallels between painting and perfume-making that the passage emphasizes, particularly in the development of complex combinations of elements that create a unified aesthetic experience.
  C: While the passage criticizes the corporate influence on perfumery, it does not make a blanket statement about the connection between commercial success and the value of art.

  It also mentions the undervaluing of truly great smells in the commercial world of perfumery.
  
  A: The passage briefly mentions that perfumers aim to create an imaginary world that can evoke memories or experiences, but it does not provide strong support for this statement as a general feature of all art.
  B: The passage discusses how perfumers combine olfactory elements to create small sensations that change and develop over time, similar to how painters build up layers of paint to create a work of art. Therefore, this statement is supported by the passage.
  C: The passage mentions how large corporations may tamper with old perfume formulas to increase profits, but it does not provide support for the idea that commercial success inevitably leads to a failed work of art.
  D: The passage mentions how the appearance of an oil painting changes over time due to the transparency of the oil paint, but it does not provide support for the idea that the best works of art improve with age.
  E: The passage does not express a view on the superiority of one form of art over another.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between the art of painting and the art of creating perfume. The author argues that both require the careful combination of natural and synthetic components to create a work that can produce a powerful aesthetic experience. The author also suggests that the commercialization of the perfume industry has led to a devaluation of truly great perfumes.
  
  A: The passage does suggest that memories can be evoked through the experience of a work of art, but it does not argue that this is the only way in which art can produce an aesthetic experience. The passage also discusses the importance of the aesthetic experience produced by the careful arrangement of olfactory elements in a fragrance.
  
  B: This choice accurately summarizes the main argument of the passage. The author argues that the creation of a great work of art, whether in the form of a painting or a perfume, requires the careful combination of many small sensations, and that both types of art can create a powerful aesthetic experience.
  
  C: The passage does not argue that creating a work of art for the sake of commercial success will necessarily lead to failure.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Stealing thunder is a courtroom strategy in which a lawyer reveals negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer.
  Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive.
  Stealing thunder may provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present.
  Jurors who often initially have little information about a case are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses several factors that contribute to the success of stealing thunder: 
  - Revealing damaging information early creates an image of credibility. 
  - Volunteering damaging information early alerts the jury to the opposition's testimony and may help them form counterarguments. 
  - Stealing thunder can make the evidence seem less scarce and therefore less valuable.
  - Stealing thunder allows the lawyer to frame the evidence in their own terms and downplay its significance.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
The author mentions juror's desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder, as explained in the passage: "Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information."

  A: The passage does not discuss timing as a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  B: The passage does not discuss lawyer's skill in assessing jurors' reactions to messages as a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  C: The passage does not discuss the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes as a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  D: The passage states that jurors are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case and may use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information, which suggests that this is a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  E: The passage does not discuss the screening of prospective jurors as a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses several psychological factors that may contribute to the success of stealing thunder, a courtroom strategy in which a lawyer reveals negative information about their own client before the opposition can do so. These factors include creating an image of credibility, encouraging critical assessment of opposing testimony, framing the evidence in positive terms, and making the evidence seem scarcer by revealing it first. The passage mentions that the effectiveness of stealing thunder has been suggested by studies of simulated trials, but not directly tested in actual trials. The passage does not discuss the timing of the thunder-stealing message in relation to the opposition's message, nor does it mention lawyers' skill in assessing juror reactions, clients' willingness to testify, or the screening of prospective jurors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how the stealing thunder strategy can be effective in a court of law and why it may work. 
  A: The passage does not mention the timing of the thunder-stealing message.
  B: The passage does not discuss the lawyers' skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions.
  C: The passage does not mention the clients' willingness to testify about their own past mistakes.
  D: The passage suggests that jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing probably contributes to the success of the stealing thunder strategy. 
  E: The passage does not discuss the screening of prospective jurors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage discusses several reasons why stealing thunder can be an effective courtroom strategy, including creating an impression of credibility, previewing opposing testimony, making a persuasive message seem scarce, downplaying the significance of the negative information, and framing the evidence positively. 
A: Although timing is mentioned as a factor in the technique's success, the passage does not suggest that stealing thunder must immediately precede similar negative information from the opposition. Therefore, A is not the correct answer.
B: The passage does mention a range of factors that may contribute to stealing thunder's effectiveness, but it does not specifically suggest that some lawyers are better than others at assessing jurors' likely reactions to messages. Therefore, B is not the correct answer.
C: The passage does not mention clients testifying in person as a factor contributing to the effectiveness of stealing thunder. Therefore, C is not the correct answer.
D: The passage suggests that stealing thunder can be effective because jurors are eager to form a firm view of the case they're hearing and that previewing opposing testimony may provide an impetus for critical assessment. Therefore, D is the correct answer.
E: The passage does not mention lawyers carefully screening prospective jurors as a factor in the effectiveness of stealing thunder. Therefore, E is not the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses several factors that may contribute to the effectiveness of stealing thunder. 
  A: The passage mentions that stealing thunder may be effective because jurors are more likely to critically assess testimony that has been previewed, but does not mention that careful timing is a factor.
  B: The passage does not mention that some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message is a factor.
  C: The passage does not mention the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person as a factor.

  C: The passage doesn't mention anything about clients testifying about their own past mistakes.
  D: The passage mentions that jurors are eager to solidify their position regarding the case, and that stealing thunder can provide an impetus for critical assessment by previewing testimony that the opposition plans to present. This suggests that D is a plausible answer.
  E: The passage doesn't mention anything about lawyers screening prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The question asks about a factor contributing to the success of stealing thunder. The author suggests that several factors probably contribute to the effectiveness of stealing thunder. The first possible factor is that volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Another factor is that stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. A third and closely related factor is that the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A fourth and related factor is that jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
The author mentions the following factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder:
- Jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage is primarily concerned with discussing the discovery of a new class of protein pathogen capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material and the research done to identify the pathogen responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Choice A is too general and does not accurately capture the main point of the passage. Choice C goes beyond the scope of the passage and makes an unsupported conclusion. Choice D is only partially correct, as while the assertion that prions cause CJD was initially met with skepticism, subsequent research has supported this conclusion. Choice E is also accurate, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is to discuss the discovery of a new class of pathogen responsible for CJD.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The passage is mainly about research on Creutzfeld-Jakob disease and the discovery of the pathogen responsible for the disease. The pathogen is different from other pathogens in that it lacks genetic material and consists mainly of protein. The pathogen has been named a prion, and it is able to reproduce itself in a unique way. Therefore, choice B is the best answer as it accurately expresses the main point of the passage. The other choices either include irrelevant information or misrepresent the main point.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage discusses recent research into the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which has identified prions as a class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. The passage details the process by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction. Additionally, the passage notes that prions may be responsible for other degenerative neurological conditions. Thus, the most accurate main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage is mainly about the discovery of a new pathogen, prions, which causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and is capable of reproducing itself without genetic material. Therefore, the correct answer is B. A is incorrect because the mechanism of protein reproduction is not the main focus of the passage. C is incorrect because the passage only suggests that prions may be responsible for other degenerative neurological conditions, but this is not the main point. D is incorrect because it only mentions the initial skepticism towards the discovery of prions, but it does not represent the main point. Finally, E is partially correct, but it does not represent the main point of the passage.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a new type of protein pathogen, called a prion, that is capable of reproducing itself without genetic material. The passage provides a detailed explanation of what prions are, how they differ from other pathogens, and the mechanism by which they reproduce and cause cellular destruction. While other options describe some of the details mentioned in the passage, only choice B accurately summarizes the main point of the passage.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The main point of the passage is to discuss the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prions that can cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) by reproducing themselves without genetic material. Answer B accurately expresses this main point. While the other answer choices mention some true details from the passage, none of them provides an accurate summary of the passage as a whole.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The main point of the passage is about the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called "prions" that is responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. The passage explains how prions were discovered, how they reproduce themselves, and how they cause cellular destruction resulting in CJD. The correct answer is B because it accurately expresses the main point of the passage. The other answer choices are either too general and do not highlight the unique contribution of prions to CJD (A, C), or they are inaccurate (D) or incomplete (E) in describing the main point of the passage.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens, known as prions, that are uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. This is stated clearly in the second paragraph and is supported by the subsequent discussion of what prions are, how they reproduce, and their implications for our understanding of degenerative neurological conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage mainly discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prions, which reproduce themselves without genetic material and are responsible for causing CJD. Therefore, the best answer is B. A is incorrect because while the passage mentions the mechanism of protein reproduction as an area that needs further study, this is not the main point of the passage. C is incorrect because while the passage briefly mentions the possibility of prions being involved in other degenerative neurological conditions, this is not the main point of the passage. D is incorrect because while the passage mentions skepticism in the scientific community about the link between prions and CJD, this is not the main point of the passage. E is close but not as accurate as B, which more specifically mentions the research into CJD as the context for discovering the new class of protein pathogens.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A describes how recent findings in neuroscience challenge the traditional idea of retribution in the criminal justice system. It argues that people's actions are caused by the operations of their brain and that free will may be an illusion.
  Passage B discusses the idea of free will in a deterministic world. It introduces the concept of "soft determinism" and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions. It argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that humans behave based on the operations of their brains and that neuroscience challenges the idea of retribution.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism, that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, and that the source of the cause determines whether an action is free.
A: Mental disorder is mentioned in passage B as a type of external source that can constrain actions, but it is not a major concept in the passage's argument.
B: Free choice is mentioned in both passages, but is a major concept in passage B's argument about determinism and free will.
C: Causality is mentioned in both passages and is a fundamental concept in both arguments.
D: Self-delusion is mentioned only in passage A as a way in which people may believe they are making a free and rational choice but are actually being influenced by emotional centers in the brain.
E: Moral responsibility is mentioned only in passage A as a dominant justification of punishment that neuroscience challenges.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
First, the passage A suggests that a person's behavior is caused by the operations of their brain and that people may not make free and rational moral choices but delude themselves, which suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution and focus on deterrence. In contrast, passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism, distinguishing between free and constrained actions, with free actions caused by internal sources and constrained actions caused by external sources. Therefore, the one concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A is:
Action: Answer("B") - free choice
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that our brain causes our behavior and that our choices are sometimes not under our control.
  Passage A suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  Passage B argues that a person can still act freely in a deterministic world by distinguishing between free and constrained actions.
  Ayer argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, but one could make the analogy that actions originating from a disease-free brain are not constrained and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A: A neuroscientist considers that a person's behavior is determined solely by the operations of their brain, which may be beyond their control. Therefore, the idea of punishing a bad person because of their freely chosen immoral acts should be abandoned.
  Passage B: The concept of free will can coexist with determinism. Actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that our behavior is caused solely by the operations of our brain and that our moral choices may actually be caused by emotional centers in the brain rather than by our rational thinking.
  Passage A suggests that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing people for their freely chosen immoral acts.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.
  Passage B distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions, arguing that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that people may not make a free and rational moral choice, and that retribution should be abandoned as a justification for punishment in law, in favor of deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses how the concept of free will can coexist with determinism, and presents Ayer's theory of "soft determinism," which distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
   
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A talks about how people may not be making free and rational choices and suggests that the focus of the criminal-justice system should be on deterring future harms instead of punishing a person based on their freely chosen immoral acts.
  Passage B discusses the concept of soft determinism and how actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It also talks about how actions and wills that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues against the idea of free choice, suggesting that people may be deluding themselves and their actions are due to brain activity beyond their control.
  Passage B argues that people can still act freely even in a deterministic world, as long as their actions are not constrained by external sources.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that a neuroscientific view of behavior changes the way we think about law, suggesting that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterrence rather than retribution.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism, and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions. 
  A: Mental disorder is mentioned in passage B as an example of a condition that can cause constrained actions, but it is not the focus of the argument.
  B: Free choice is a key concept in passage B, but it is also mentioned in passage A as a concept that can be delusional.
  C: Causality is a common theme in both passages.
  D: Self-delusion is mentioned in passage A as a possible consequence of believing in free and rational moral choice, but it is not the focus of the argument.
  E: Moral responsibility is primarily discussed in passage A as a concept that should be replaced by deterrence.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: According to the passage, which one of the following was true of the physics community during the 1930s?
Choices:
  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: It reevaluated caleulations indicating that atoms could be split

Knowledge:
The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission in the 1930s, and how it was initially overlooked by the physics community. The physicists were not receptive to the possibility of breaking atoms apart when they were conducting neutron-bombardment experiments on uranium, because they were not aiming for that outcome. The radioactive substances produced by the experiments remained unidentified partly because they were difficult to analyze chemically and because researchers expected them to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. However, the physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing it. It was only when Lise Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations that the researchers realized they had been splitting uranium atoms.

A: The passage does not suggest that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments. Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart before the experiments were conducted, but the physicists were not receptive to the possibility of fission occurring in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments on uranium.
B: The passage does not mention that the community reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split. The experimental evidence was compiled before the physicists recognized what they were witnessing, and Lise Meitner was the first to recognize the significance of the data.

While there are other experiments and evidence discussed in the passage, this option seems to best capture the focus of the passage and the evidence that was initially misinterpreted before the discovery of nuclear fission was fully recognized.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how scientists amassed increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939, but they didn't recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939. 
  Otto Hahn's experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium in 1938 provided a crucial observation and a puzzling group of radioactive substances. Despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occurred, Hahn remarked that it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics." With Meitner's theoretical insight and theoretical calculation, it became clear that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
Action: Answer("A")  
Given that the author describes the increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved by the scientists between 1934 and 1939, it can be inferred that the author is referring to the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 as "the relevant evidence" in line 62.
Response 8:
Knowledge: The author describes in detail how scientists had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing. Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection when she recognized that they had actually been splitting uranium atoms. The author mentions that "relevant evidence" was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
A: The experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 were part of the evidence but not the whole of the relevant evidence.
B: Meitner's experiments in 1938 were part of the evidence but not the whole of the relevant evidence.
C: The clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium was part of the evidence but not the whole of the relevant evidence.
D: The sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium being the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus was part of the evidence but not the whole of the relevant evidence.
E: The fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long was not the relevant evidence that the author is referring to. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")

The relevant evidence refers to the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which provided increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved. While the clear chemical evidence of barium's production and the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium provided crucial pieces of evidence, these alone did not constitute the "relevant evidence" that had been present for some time.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Lichtenstein as an artist who merged popular genre with fine art and who rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism. His work had an impulse toward realism and a kind of deliberate naivete intended as a response to the oversophistication of some other pop artists. He used comic art conventions to demonstrate a faith in reconciliation between cartoons and fine art, and between parody and true feeling. 
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  The passage describes Lichtenstein as an artist who rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, who responded to the oversophistication of some other pop artists with a kind of deliberate naivete, and who used comic art conventions to demonstrate a faith in reconciliation between parody and true feeling. None of these descriptions would be challenged if Lichtenstein had criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion. However, if Lichtenstein praised an abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing atypically emotional paintings or an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, this would challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, as it would suggest that Lichtenstein did not rebel against the emotional power of abstract expressionism but instead respected it. Therefore, Answer D is the correct answer because it is the only option that, if true, would not align with the author's description of Lichtenstein's attitude towards emotional content in painting.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Roy Lichtenstein's work as a pop artist, his approach to merging popular genre and fine art, and how his work differs from that of other pop artists and abstract expressionists.
  A: This fact about Lichtenstein attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s does not directly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as a response to a fading emotional power of abstract expressionism. It is possible for Lichtenstein to have attended such exhibitions for other reasons, and still hold this view.
  B: This fact about Lichtenstein praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein either. Although Lichtenstein's work was a reaction against some aspects of abstract expressionism, he could still appreciate and praise works that had emotional power.
  C: This fact about Lichtenstein praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings also would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work. Again, appreciation of emotional power in abstract expressionist works does not preclude Lichtenstein's own work from being a reaction against the fading emotional power of the later abstract expressionists.
  D: This fact about Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work either. It is possible for Lichtenstein to have criticized other pop artists for producing emotional works while still holding his own view of the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  E: This fact about Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion might challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work, since Lichtenstein's own work was a reaction against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, and he viewed the depiction of contemporary life as important. If he criticized a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion, it might suggest that he valued emotion in art in general, which could contradict the author's characterization.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of popular and fine art, a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, and an impulse toward realism, all displayed with deliberate naivete and an inner sweetness. 
  A: Lichtenstein attending exhibitions of abstract expressionist painters is not directly related to his characterization by the author. It does not affect whether his work was a rebellion against abstract expressionism, or if it displayed an impulse toward realism. Therefore, this choice is not the most challenging.
  B: Lichtenstein praising an abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting may indicate that Lichtenstein did not rebel against abstract expressionism as the passage suggests, or that Lichtenstein valued emotion in painting. Therefore, this choice is the most challenging.
  C: Lichtenstein praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings does not affect whether his work was a rebellion against abstract expressionism or whether it displayed an impulse toward realism. Therefore, this choice is not the most challenging.
  D: Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings is not directly related to his characterization by the author. It does not affect whether his work was a rebellion against abstract expressionism, or if it displayed an impulse toward realism. Therefore, this choice is not the most challenging.
  E: Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion does not directly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. It does not affect whether his work was a rebellion against abstract expressionism or whether it displayed an impulse toward realism. Therefore, this choice is not the most challenging.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The passage characterizes Lichtenstein as a painter who merged a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art and, in doing so, generated a complex result that conveyed a seriousness of theme beyond mere parody. The author argues that Lichtenstein's work, though it poked fun at the pretensions of the art world, also displayed an impulse toward realism and a kind of deliberate naivete that gave it an inner sweetness. The author also suggests that Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and that his persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrated a faith in reconciliation.

A: Lichtenstein's attendance at exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of him, especially if the author is correct in claiming that Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.

B: Lichtenstein's praise for an emotional painting by a contemporary abstract expressionist is not necessarily incompatible with the idea that he was rebelling against the second generation of abstract expressionists whose work he found overly lyrical. Furthermore, the passage characterizes Lichtenstein's work as displaying an impulse toward realism and a kind of deliberate naivete that gave it an inner sweetness, so praise for an emotional painting would not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of him.

C: Lichtenstein's praise for an early abstract expressionist who produced emotional paintings does not necessarily contradict the idea that his work was part of a general rebellion against the emotional power of abstract expressionism at the time pop art emerged.

D: Lichtenstein's criticism of a pop artist for producing emotional paintings would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of him, especially if the author is correct in claiming that Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism and a kind of deliberate naivete that gave it an inner sweetness.

E: Lichtenstein's criticism of a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion would not necessarily contradict the idea that his work displayed an impulse toward realism and a deliberate naivete that gave it an inner sweetness.

D: Lichtenstein's criticism of a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings does not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, who is not described as advocating for an absence of emotion in paintings.
E: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, this would support the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as valuing a deliberate naivete in his own work.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Lichtenstein's art and how it both parodied and paid tribute to comic books while also reacting to the excess of sophistication he observed in both abstract expressionism and some other pop artists. The passage characterizes Lichtenstein's work as deliberately naive and nostalgic, with a faith in reconciliation and true feeling.

Action: Answer("D")
Given the information in the passage, Lichtenstein's artwork seems to be about a reconciliation between high art and popular culture. He favors a deliberate naivete and a critique of the sophistication observed in other pop artists. If Lichtenstein were to criticize a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, this would be consistent with the passage's characterization of his work.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of popular culture with fine art that manages to convey a seriousness of theme while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.

  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws undermine the efficiency of the stock market. All relevant information about a company should be shared as quickly and widely as possible. People with accurate information about changing circumstances should be able to act on them. Such actions help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines transparency of the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would deny companies access to funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, and that insider trading laws may undermine the transparency of the market.
  - Passage B argues that transparency is essential to a functioning stock market, and that insider trading undermines investor confidence and the integrity of the market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  - Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit insiders to trade based on information they have that others don't have, as long as they do not use information to make stock transactions ahead of the general public. This is because, in a transparent stock market, investors with accurate knowledge about a company's value can help ensure a more accurate assessment of the company's value.
  - Passage B argues that insider-trading should be prohibited because it undermines investor confidence in the stock market and creates an unfair advantage for insiders.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The author of passage A argues that insider trading laws should allow trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, but not based on information obtained from one's position within a company, since that information would unfairly compromise the market. Passage A also argues that insider trading laws should not prohibit selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping, as this information helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. 
  In contrast, the author of passage B argues that in a transparent stock market, all participants have the same chance of making good investment decisions, so insider trading should be prohibited because it unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The author of passage A argues that insider trading laws are unnecessary because the stock market relies on people having information that others don't have and that when people trade based on such information, it helps ensure that stock prices reflect all the relevant facts, which is good for everyone in the stock market.
  The author of passage B argues that insider trading is bad for the market because it denies other people the chance to make similarly informed investment decisions, which in turn undermines investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The author of passage A argues that it is not fair to prohibit all trades based on information that is not shared by everyone, and that insider trading can actually help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. However, the author of passage B argues that insider-trading situations compromise the market by allowing some people to make investment decisions based on information that others don't have, which ultimately undermines investor confidence and could destroy the market.

Analysis:
  The author of passage A believes that it is not fair or beneficial to prohibit all trades based on information that is not shared by everyone, as insider trading can help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. Thus, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Passage A supports the idea that insider-trading laws should allow people to act on accurate information that can affect a company's stock price, even if that information comes from an insider. They argue that this helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  - Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines the transparency of the stock market because it gives some people an unfair advantage over others.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should be reconsidered in light of the fact that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. It suggests that people should be permitted to act on accurate information about changing circumstances so that stock prices reflect them.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the stock market and unfairly compromises the market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. It suggests that insider trading should be prohibited to maintain a level playing field and investor confidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author of Passage A supports the idea that insider trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is available to a person as a result of their analysis of a stock. They argue that the stock market works best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible.
  The author of Passage B supports the idea that insider trading is illegal and that it undermines investor confidence in the stock market. They argue that insider trading gives an unfair advantage to people with inside information and makes it difficult for other people to earn money in the stock market. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  - The author of passage A argues that insider-trading laws should not prohibit all trading based on inside information, but rather should differentiate between trading based on special position within a company and trading based on analysis of a stock that is available to everyone.
  - The author of passage B argues that insider-trading undermines the transparency of the market and can lead to a loss of investor confidence, denying companies the funds they need to grow.
  A: This law would prohibit all trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which is not consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A, who argues that it is not possible or desirable for every investor to have access to all information.
  B: This law would permit trading based on analysis of a stock that is available to everyone but would prohibit trading based on special position within a company, which is consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A.
  C: This law would prohibit trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage B but not that articulated by the author of passage A.
  D: This law legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A, who argues that it is good for the market if people who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them.
  E: This law legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means, which is not consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage B but does not provide enough information to determine whether it is consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two theories about how communication between neurons occurs: one that involves electrical impulses and one that involves chemicals called neurotransmitters.
  The passage explains that the second theory has gradually won acceptance and that recent evidence shows that the structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  It also explains that differences among receptors for neurotransmitters could allow for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses a historical debate among neurobiologists about whether the brain is guided by electrical signals or by chemicals.
- The passage explains that evidence now supports the theory that communication between neurons is achieved through the use of chemicals (neurotransmitters), which bind to receptors and make the receiving neuron permeable to ions, producing an electrical impulse.
- The passage also notes that researchers have identified a family of receptors that play a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity, and that slight differences in the properties of these receptors could be used to selectively treat brain disorders.

Analysis:
The main point of the passage is that the brain is guided by chemicals, not electrical signals, and that the discovery of a family of receptors that mediate the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity could provide a basis for selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

A: This choice accurately reflects the main point of the passage, stating that the brain is guided by chemicals, and that differences among the receptors for these chemicals could permit selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
B: This choice accurately reflects the idea that similarities exist among the chemicals responsible for communication between neurons, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is the selective treatment of brain disorders.
C: This choice accurately states that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is the selective treatment of brain disorders.
D: This choice accurately reflects the main point of the passage, stating that the brain is guided by chemicals and that differences among the receptors for these chemicals could permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
E: This choice accurately reflects the idea that differences among receptor molecules in the brain could be exploited to treat certain brain disorders with drugs, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is that the brain is guided by chemicals and that this knowledge could be used to selectively treat brain disorders.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how communication between neurons in the brain works; it used to be thought that electrical impulses passed directly from one neuron to the next, but now it is known that chemical neurotransmitters are involved. The neurotransmitters bind to receptor molecules on the receiving neuron, which causes ions to enter the neuron and generates an electrical impulse. The passage also discusses recent evidence that explains how the neurotransmitter binding causes the receptor channel to open and permit the flow of ions.
A: This choice accurately describes the main point of the passage. It states that the workings of the brain are guided by chemicals rather than electrical signals, and that subtle differences in the receptors for these chemicals may allow for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders. This accurately summarizes the main ideas of the passage.
B: This choice accurately describes some details mentioned in the passage, but it does not accurately capture the main point. While the passage does mention that several receptors for neurotransmitters share similarities and can be classified as a family, this is not the central point of the passage.
C: This choice accurately describes a detail discussed in the passage, but it does not accurately capture the main point. While the passage does describe how electrical impulses are transmitted chemically between neurons, this is not the central point of the passage.
D: This choice accurately describes the main point of the passage. It states that the workings of the brain are guided by chemicals rather than electrical signals, and that subtle differences in the receptors for these chemicals may allow for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes the "great contradiction" between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand depends on the assumption of diminishing returns. The passage explains how the economics of diminishing returns were easier to represent mathematically and, therefore, dominated economic thought for almost two centuries. However, economists have since found ways to describe the Pin Factory and account for increasing returns. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Choice E best expresses this idea.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses how Adam Smith's two concepts, the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, are in contradiction to each other. It then explains how the economics of diminishing returns (the Invisible Hand) dominated economic theory until the late 1970s because it can be represented mathematically, whereas the economics of increasing returns (the Pin Factory) are harder to represent mathematically. However, recent developments in mathematics have enabled economists to account for increasing returns. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Choice (E) is the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: The passage discusses the contradiction inherent in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and how increasing returns to scale present a challenge to the Invisible Hand's requirement for many competitors in each industry. The passage also explains why economics had historically favored diminishing returns to scale, and why it was difficult to incorporate increasing returns into mainstream economic thought. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Choice A is incorrect because it implies that mainstream economists have always believed in increasing returns to scale, which is not true. Choice B is incorrect because it focuses on the acceptance of the Invisible Hand rather than the failure to account for increasing returns to scale. Choice C is incorrect because it implies that the Pin Factory is more important or favored than the Invisible Hand, which is not true. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on Adam Smith rather than the main point of the passage.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses a contradiction inherent in economic theory between the increasing returns to scale seen in many industries and the assumption that free markets always get it right. The parable of the pin factory illustrates the increasing returns to scale - the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and the more pins the factory can produce per worker. However, increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, so the idea of free markets depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, but economists failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. The passage describes the effort to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought and how it finally occurred since the late 1970s. Therefore, the most accurate main point of the passage is that economists have, until recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Hence, the answer is E.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

The main point of the passage is explaining how the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand are opposed to each other, and how the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, which prevented economists from accounting for increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries. It argues that economists only managed to bring the Pin Factory, i.e., the idea of increasing returns, into the mainstream of economic thought after finding ways to describe it mathematically. Therefore, the most accurate choice is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
The passage describes the contradiction between two concepts in economic theory since 1776: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. According to Smith, increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which impacts the functioning of the Invisible Hand. Until recently, economists had failed to account for the impact of increasing returns to scale on the market economy.

A: This answer choice is partially true, but it doesn't accurately express the main point of the passage. The author discusses the increasing returns to scale but does not say that mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing. 
B: This answer choice is true, but it does not accurately express the main point of the passage. The author discusses how the dynamics of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand impact one another because of increasing returns to scale.
C: This answer choice is not accurate. The author does not claim that recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
D: This answer choice is too narrow. While the passage mentions Adam Smith and his ideas about self-interest and the common good, this is not the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes a contradiction between two concepts in economic theory: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory describes increasing returns to scale, which tend to result in larger competitors driving smaller competitors out of business and creating monopolies.
  The Invisible Hand relies on many competitors to operate properly and create a market that is competitive and benefits the common good.
  Economists have historically struggled to incorporate the Pin Factory into economic theory due to difficulty in rigorously modeling increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

The main point of the passage is that for a long time economists have failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries and how this has created a contradiction between two economic concepts: the Pin Factory, which represents increasing returns to scale, and the Invisible Hand, which depends on many competitors in each industry so that nobody can exert monopoly power. The passage also explains how recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously than before. Answer choices A, B, C, and D are either too narrow, too broad, or miss the key point of the passage.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

The main point of the passage is the contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The Pin Factory is an example of increasing returns to scale, which lead to natural monopolies. The Invisible Hand relies on the assumption of diminishing returns to scale and the presence of many competitors in each industry. The passage explains why it was difficult for economists to incorporate the Pin Factory into economic thought for a long time, and how recent developments in mathematics have made this possible. Therefore, the correct answer is E: "Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries."
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

The main point of the passage is how economic theory struggled to reconcile the concepts of increasing returns to scale (exemplified by the Pin Factory) and the functioning of the Invisible Hand in a competitive marketplace. Diminishing returns were assumed to be the norm for over two centuries, but recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously, leading to a greater understanding of the increasing returns to scale in many industries. The passage also discusses how the Invisible Hand was accepted because diminishing returns could be described mathematically. So, the best answer is E.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")  
Knowledge: The passage explains how earlier migrants played a crucial role in reducing the physical and financial costs of migration, and in providing a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants who moved to the North. The passage also highlights the difficulties and costs associated with migration, and how the Great Migration developed momentum over time as more and more African Americans left the South for the North, aided by the information and support provided by earlier migrants. While the passage mentions factors that triggered the Great Migration, such as World War I, a boll weevil infestation, and the income differential between the North and South, these factors are not the main point of the passage. 
Choice A is not wrong, but it only describes an event mentioned in the passage and fails to capture the overall significance of this event. 
Choice B mentions some of the catalysts of the Great Migration, but it does not capture the larger theme of the passage, which is the role of earlier migrants in facilitating and sustaining a large-scale migration movement. 
Choice C incorrectly suggests that the income differential between the North and South ceased to be a factor in the duration of the Great Migration, whereas the passage does not address this issue. 
Choice E goes beyond the scope of the passage by suggesting that other factors not mentioned in the passage help to explain the duration of the Great Migration.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the Northern United States from 1915-1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by several factors, including World War I increasing labor demand in the industrial North, labor agents recruiting African American labor in the South, and a boll weevil infestation reducing labor demand in the South.
  Once started, migration developed momentum over time as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration.
  Early migrants provided information about labor and housing market conditions, reduced the physical costs, and provided temporary housing, food, and credit for later migrants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the North between 1915 and 1960, and the reasons why migration continued and even accelerated in subsequent decades. The passage explains how earlier migrants provided information, reduced physical costs, and provided a cultural cushion that helped subsequent migrants, which contributed to the momentum of migration.

A: This choice accurately summarizes the statistic on the percentage of African Americans leaving the South during the Great Migration, but it does not capture the main point of the passage, which is about the momentum and duration of the migration.
B: This choice accurately explains some of the triggers of the Great Migration, but it is not the main point of the passage, which is about the momentum and duration of the migration.
C: This choice accurately explains how the assistance provided by earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, and it also connects this assistance to the acceleration of migration over time. This is a key point of the passage, and it is the best answer.
D: This choice accurately explains how earlier migrants reduced the physical costs of moving and provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, but it does not capture the main point of the passage, which is about the momentum and duration of the migration.
E: This choice accurately notes that there were factors beyond the income differential that contributed to the duration of the Great Migration, but it does not capture the main point of the passage, which is about how the momentum of migration built up over time.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by increased labor demand in the industrial North, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and the cut off immigration due to World War I, which led to employers sending labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South.
  The difficulties and costs of migration included uncertainty about housing and labor-market conditions in the destination, physical costs of moving, and the need to adapt to new labor- and housing-market institutions, culture, and language. These costs were reduced by information passed through letters and conversation, earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South reducing physical costs, and previous migrants reducing new migrants' cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and credit.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The authors of Passage A argue that insider trading based on non-public information can help spread the knowledge and ensure that stock prices better reflect all the facts. They also mention that insider non-trading is a more widespread practice and it shouldn't be considered a crime. 
  The author of Passage B argues that transparency is one of the basic principles of the stock market and that investors should make investment decisions based on information available to all market participants at the same time.

  The second paragraph explains why the Great Migration developed momentum over time.
  The last sentence of the second paragraph serves a purpose that is not yet described.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The second paragraph states that the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier. Migration continued and even accelerated in subsequent decades. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if the expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters and conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Early migrants provided information about labor and housing market conditions to their friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Previous migrants reduced new migrants' cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. 
Action: Answer("D")  
The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain, which is that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with their new surroundings.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The second paragraph describes the difficulty and cost of migration and the factors that reduce them. It discusses the transmission of information among migrants, how earlier migrants helped later migrants, and how these factors reduced the cost of migration. 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph reads "Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then-new surroundings."

Action: Answer("D") 

The last sentence of the second paragraph presents a fact about the Great Migration (previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants), which the authors seek to explain in subsequent paragraphs.
Response 4:
Knowledge: The second paragraph starts with proposing that migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Then, it discusses the difficulties and costs of migration and how it was alleviated by early migrants providing information and temporary support to new migrants. The last sentence of the paragraph states, "Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings."
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The correct answer is D because the last sentence of the second paragraph states a fact about the Great Migration, that is, previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants. The authors seek to explain this fact in subsequent paragraphs, particularly how early migrants provided information and support to new migrants, reducing the difficulty and cost of migration.
Response 5:
Knowledge: The question asks about the purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph. The sentence states that once migrants began to migrate, they helped to reduce the cost and difficulty of future migration by passing along information, providing temporary housing and credit, and cultural support. This sentence could be seen as a summary of the previous sentence, which lists several ways that previous migrants reduced the cost and difficulty of migration for future migrants. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the reasons for the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the North between 1915 and 1960. 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states that it is unclear why the migration continued and accelerated even after North-South income differences narrowed.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the causes and ongoing factors that explain the Great Migration, which refers to the mass movement of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial North between 1915 and 1960. The second paragraph explains how prior migration impacts the cost, ease, and adaptation of future migration.

Action: Answer("D") 
The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain. The fact is that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, which reduced their struggle with new surroundings. The sentence provides evidence for how prior migration impacts the cost, ease, and adaptation of future migration.
Response 8:
Knowledge: The question refers to the last sentence of the second paragraph and asks why it is included. This sentence indicates that previous migrants served as a cultural cushion for later migrants and made their migration easier. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The second paragraph discusses the reasons for the Great Migration and how it developed momentum over time.
  The last sentence of the second paragraph refers to how early migrants helped later migrants by reducing their cost of adapting to a new locale and culture.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses Taruskin’s opinion on how art produced by and for political and social elites embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways. The passage does not suggest that all talented artists throughout history embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways, nor does it suggest that successful artists today reflect the ideology of the elite. The passage does suggest that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way, but it does not imply that this is Taruskin's position. The passage describes both the aristocratic or governing class and the well-to-do middle class as two social classes able to commission art.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains the reasons why dance had been neglected as an area of social research before Katherine Dunham's work. The peers referred to in line 22 are social scientists and anthropologists who were reluctant to study dance ethnology because they considered it difficult to conduct scientific research in this area, given the lack of expertise in dance techniques and the theory that data collection had to be done from a position of detachment.
  
A: The passage doesn't suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.

B: The passage doesn't agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well-versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data about them. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.

C: The passage suggests that Dunham's approach diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at that time, which didn't involve the observation of the dances. Therefore, this option can be a possible answer to the question.

D: The passage doesn't suggest that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.

E: The passage doesn't suggest that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research in the past due to a lack of experts who were trained in both social research methods and dance techniques.
  The passage suggests that Katherine Dunham's success was due in part to her training in both anthropology and choreography, and her approach to research involved participating in the dances she was studying.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Option B suggests that social scientists do not need to be well versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data about them. This statement is consistent with the long-standing view in anthropology, which is mentioned in the passage, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. The passage describes Katherine Dunham's approach as diverging radically from this methodology, suggesting that her success was due in part to her willingness to become personally involved in the dances she was studying. Therefore, Option B is the best answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research before Katherine Dunham's work in the 1930s. 
  The passage describes the advice of colleagues in anthropology who advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances and because they subscribed to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
Action: Answer("B") 
The peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with choice B that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. This view is consistent with the prevailing methodology that discouraged physical involvement in the subject of study and emphasizes scientific rigor and objectivity.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how dance had been neglected as an area of social research due to the lack of understanding of dance techniques and the prevailing view that effective data gathering can only be conducted from a position of complete detachment.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss how income affects happiness and how people compare their income with some reference group or norm. 
  Passage A suggests that people compare their income with others who are most like them. People adjust to higher standards of living, which make little difference over time, and overinvest in material possessions. The majority chose the first option in the Solnick and Hemenway study, indicating that they were happy to be poorer as long as their relative position improved. 
  Passage B suggests that earning more money makes people happier because it makes them feel that they are successful and that they have created value. People use material wealth to show that they are prosperous because they create value. Wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B discuss the connection between wealth and happiness and the phenomenon of wanting to have more than others with regards to income. 
  Passage A explains that we are comparing our income with some norm, which must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm, and people invest too much on material possessions, at the expense of leisure. The passage concludes that people care most about their relative position compared to people the authors describe as "reference group."
  Passage B disputes the explanation that people want to make more money due to an urge to demonstrate superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects but explains that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passages explain that people strive to earn more money not only to acquire material possessions and demonstrate their superiority, but also to create value and feel successful. The pursuit of material wealth can bring happiness in the context of relative prosperity (comparing oneself to reference groups). The passages do not offer any terms or adjectives that would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Passage A and Passage B both discuss how people are influenced by their relative prosperity and compare themselves to others, and how earning more money creates a sense of success and value. However, neither passage provides any indication of the "terms" the authors would use to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness. 
  Passage A mentions that people compare their income with some norm and that their happiness can depend on how they compare to others.
  Passage B argues that people are happiest when they feel successful and that wanting to create value through material wealth is not necessarily an ignoble tendency.
Action: Answer("D")  misguided, admirable
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B support the idea that people are happier not just with the amount of money they earn, but with the relative prosperity of their lives.
  Passage A states that people want to compare themselves to a norm and that it is the level of income relative to others that influences happiness.
  Passage B suggests that the desire to create value is what motivates people to earn more money than others.
  None of the passage uses the terms mentioned in the answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  According to passage A and passage B, people tend to compare themselves with their "reference group" and care about relative prosperity, which makes them feel successful. Additionally, people use material wealth not just to show that they are prosperous, but also to show that they create value. The competition with neighbors for material prosperity could be seen as evidence of a desire to create value, which benefits society and brings happiness. However, it is not stated how the person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors would be most likely described by the authors of the passages.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The two passages discuss how people's relative income affects their happiness and how social comparison motivates people to pursue income. Passage A argues social comparison causes people to become habituated to rising living standards and to focus on relative status, with financial status serving as a benchmark. Passage B argues that relative income makes people happy because it signifies success and creating value, and that desiring to create value is good for society.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Passage A could consider someone wanting to make more money than their neighbors as "misguided" because they may be sacrificing leisure and overall happiness to achieve a higher status that is constantly readjusted according to social norms. Passage B could consider it merely "admirable" because they are trying to create more value for themselves and others, which would ultimately benefit society.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passages explain the paradox of happiness and wealth and describe two phenomena that push up the norm by which people compare their income: habituation and rivalry. People are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved (rivalry). In passage B, the authors support the theory that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value, and that material wealth shows that they are prosperous because they create value.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Both passages suggest that a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors may be described by the authors of Passage A as misguided due to the paradox of happiness and wealth and the phenomena of habituation and rivalry. In Passage B, the authors support the idea that wanting to create value benefits society. Therefore, the authors of Passage B would most likely describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as admirable. Hence, the best answer is D.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The authors of Passage A and B argue that relative prosperity compared to a reference group is the key to happiness.
  Both passages agree that people use material wealth to show that they are prosperous because they create value, and this desire to create value benefits society.
  Neither passage positively describes a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as egocentric or primitive, nor negatively as misguided.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: The information in the passage most helps to answer a which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: What laboratory experiments were conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs?
  B: What was the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1 987?
  C: In what year did Molina testify before the U.S. Congress?
  D: Does .any chemical that does not contain chlorine contribute to the destruction of ozone molecules?
  E: Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the pioneering research and advocacy of scientists Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland on the depletion of the ozone layer due to manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. As a result of Molina and Rowland's research, an international agreement was made to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases (the Montreal Protocol of 1987).

Action: Answer("E") 
The information in the passage most helps to answer the question "Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?" The passage states that the CFCs contain chlorine, which is the constituent element of CFCs that reacts with and destroys the ozone.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: 
The passage does not provide information on what laboratory experiments were conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs (choice A). While the passage provides information on the accumulation of CFCs in the atmosphere, it does not provide an estimate of the concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1987 (choice B). However, the passage mentions that in 1 974 Molina testified before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment, which directly answers choice C. The passage does not provide information on whether any chemical that does not contain chlorine contributes to the destruction of ozone molecules (choice D). The passage states that chlorine, which is present in CFCs, is the constituent element of great concern in relation to ozone destruction (choice E).
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses the research and advocacy efforts of Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland on the depletion of the ozone layer caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants. When released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. Molina and Rowland's research led to the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.

Relevant information: 
  Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. 
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.

Answer Explanation: The passage provides information about how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, and how the chlorine, which is a constituent element in CFC, destroys and regenerates itself in a way that further contributes to ozone depletion. Therefore, the passage would best provide information to answer the question, "Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?" Therefore, the answer is E.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses the research of Molina and Rowland into the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer. They found that CFCs rise into the stratosphere, where they chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, and estimated that the then-current accumulation of CFCs in the atmosphere would continue to contribute to depletion for years. Molina testified before Congress and was involved in policy committees that addressed this environmental threat. Their work contributed to the development of an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.

A: The passage briefly mentions that Molina and Rowland studied two freon gases-types of CFCs-but does not give further details on what laboratory experiments they conducted.
B: The passage estimates the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production in 1974 but does not state the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1987.
C: The passage states that Molina was invited to testify before the US Congress but does not state the year in which this occurred.
D: The passage does not discuss any constituents other than chlorine that contribute to the destruction of ozone molecules.
E: The passage states that chlorine is released when CFCs break down in the stratosphere and that the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine is devastating to the ozone layer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage provides detailed information about how the stratospheric ozone layer is attacked and depleted by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) when they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. Therefore, the information in the passage most helps to answer "Which constituent element of CFCs is most damaging to ozone?" and the correct answer is E.
Response 6:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The passage describes the chemical composition of plants, which contains primary and secondary substances.
- Secondary substances provide distinctive tastes and smells and can play vital roles in the lives of plants and insects.
- Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects to blossoms, while others provide biochemical defenses against insects, either by causing unpleasant symptoms or being toxic.
- Insects evolve and adapt to circumvent the plants' defenses, and specific species of insects become associated with botanically restricted groups of plants.

Analysis: 
- Option A correctly summarizes the passage's description of primary and secondary substances in plants and the roles of some secondary substances in plants' lives, including their interactions with insects.
- Option B is partially correct; the passage describes how insects adapt to plants' defenses, but there is no mention of a wide variety of insects circumventing the defenses of plants used by one particular insect as a food source.
- Option C is incorrect. The passage states that insects are able to identify restricted groups of plants by their characteristic flavors or odors.
- Option D is incorrect; the passage implies that some secondary substances that are toxic are conserved by natural selection, and it does not mention independent evolution or the survival of toxic substances in only a few species.
- Option E is partially correct; the passage mentions that some toxic substances evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including their primary and secondary substances, and the roles of these substances in plant growth and metabolism. Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and can act as biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, many of which are insects. Plants and insects have co-evolved over hundreds of millions of years, and there is a constant evolutionary competition between them.
  
A: The passage does support the idea that some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants. However, this idea is referring to secondary substances, which are discussed in the passage. 
B: The passage does support the idea that most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses. The passage states that "As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect". 
C: The passage does not support the idea that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell. Rather, the passage suggests that insects have evolved to identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors. 
D: The passage does not support the idea that many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species. The passage does not mention the survival or frequency of toxic secondary substances. 
E: The passage supports the idea that some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances. The passage states that "Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die." 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the role of primary and secondary substances in plants, and how secondary substances are responsible for the distinctive taste and smell of plants. It also explains how insects play a major role in the evolution of secondary substances in plants as a defense mechanism against insects. There is a competition between plants' defense mechanisms and insects' ability to circumvent them. This competition has led to narrowly defined and botanically restricted associations between insects and plants. 
A: The passage describes secondary substances as chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. They are responsible for the distinctive taste and smell of plants and evolved as a part of plant defense mechanisms against insects. Some secondary substances are scents that attract pollinating insects, whereas others are biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects. So, choice A is supported by the passage.
B: The passage says that most plants have developed defense mechanisms against insects, and the chemical structure of these defense mechanisms varies from plant to plant. While some insects can circumvent these defense mechanisms, the passage does not support the idea that the majority of insects use a wide variety of plants with chemical defense systems.
C: The passage states that insects come to prefer plants whose defense mechanisms they can circumvent, and eventually evolve the ability to identify these plants by their characteristic flavors or odors. There is no mention of whether or not these plants belong to botanically restricted groups.
D: The passage does not talk about the independent evolution of toxic secondary substances in unrelated species of plants or their survival in certain species.
E: The passage does not discuss toxic substances that evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not secondary substances themselves.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the chemical compounds of plants and the impact they have on insects.
  A: The passage mentions that secondary substances, which are not involved in internal chemical processes of plants, are responsible for giving plants their distinctive tastes and smells. The passage also mentions that some of these secondary substances are favored by natural selection for their role in attracting pollinating insects and defending plants against plant-eating insects. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that some chemicals that are not directly involved in growth or metabolism do play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: The passage mentions that plants develop defenses against plant-eating insects, including biochemical defenses. While some insects have evolved ways to circumvent these defenses, the passage does not directly state that most plants with chemical defense systems are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects. This statement is an exaggeration and goes beyond what is supported by the passage.
  C: The passage directly contradicts this statement. It states that insects have evolved the ability to identify plants whose defenses they can circumvent by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. Therefore, they do rely on these characteristic smells and tastes to identify certain plants.
  D: The passage mentions that secondary substances that are harmful to insects have arisen due to genetic mutations and that the same or similar substances tend to emerge in related plants. It also notes that there has been an evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects for hundreds of millions of years. However, there is no evidence in the passage to support the idea that many toxic secondary substances have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants.
  E: The passage notes that some substances that are produced by plants are toxic to insects. While it does not directly state that these toxic substances evolved in correlation with secondary substances, it does mention that secondary substances arise from genetic mutations and that the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about primary and secondary substances in plants.
  Secondary substances, in addition to giving distinct tastes and smells, also provide biochemical defense against insects.
  Insects have to circumvent the plants' defenses and evolve ways to avoid harmful substances in plants.
  As a result of this evolutionary competition between plants and insects, fewer plants remain as suitable food sources for any one species of insect.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the role of primary and secondary substances in plants' chemical composition.
  Insects have played a role in the development of secondary substances in plants.
  Secondary substances can deter insect feeding or act as biochemical defenses.

Analysis:
  A: The passage provides support that secondary chemical substances in plants can play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants, but it does not suggest that these secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Incorrect.
  B: The passage provides support that plants have developed chemical defenses against insects that are circumvented by the evolution of other insects that avoid or digest the toxic substances, thus some plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses. Correct.
  C: The passage suggests that insects can identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. It does not support the inference that insects are able to identify exclusively certain botanically restricted groups of plants. Incorrect. 
  D: The passage suggests that secondary substances that are toxic to insects have arisen as the result of genetic mutations and have been conserved by natural selection. It does not suggest that toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants and to have survived in only a few species. Incorrect.
  E: The passage suggests that toxic secondary substances in plants can evolve alongside secondary substances that deter insect feeding but are not themselves secondary substances. It does not suggest that these substances have developed in correlation with unrelated species of plants, nor does it provide evidence that these substances have evolved independently. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary. The primary substances are necessary for all plants, whereas the secondary substances are diverse and have no specific internal role. Secondary substances develop due to genetic mutations and natural selection and can attract pollinating insects or act as defensive mechanisms.
A: The answer is referring to secondary substances that are not involved in growth or metabolism processes but play a role in the life of the plant. This aligns with the passage's description of secondary substances' diverse chemical compositions and their role in giving plants their distinct tastes and smells. Thus, A is the best answer.
B: This answer is incorrect as the passage mentions that plants develop defenses against insects, which may cause insects to search for other food sources. However, there is no description of a wide variety of insects evolving ways to circumvent plant defenses.
C: The passage states the opposite; most insects that feed on certain groups of plants tend to be restricted in their botanical associations as they evolve ways to identify and feed on these specific plants.
D: This answer is partially correct as secondary substances have evolved in individual species of plants and are found in related plants that are part of the same family. However, there is no mention of these toxic substances being found in only a few plant species.
E: The passage does not discuss toxic substances that are not secondary substances. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and the role of secondary substances in the survival and reproduction of plants. These secondary substances can be beneficial to plants as defenses against insect enemies or as scents to attract pollinating insects. Insects that feed on plants have to evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses over time. 
A: The passage states that secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth and metabolism, but they play important roles in the survival and reproduction of various species of plants. 
B: The passage discusses the competition between plants and plant-eating insects, and evolutionary development of insect adaptations to overcome plant defenses. However, it doesn't say that most plants with chemical defense systems against certain insect species are used as food by a wide variety of insects.
C: The passage states that species of insects have tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants. It is also stated that insects eventually evolve the ability to identify food plants by their characteristic flavors or odors. However, it doesn't say that most insects that feed exclusively on certain plant groups are able to identify them using means other than taste or smell.
D: The passage discusses the survival of secondary substances by natural selection when proven to be effective and beneficial to plants. However, it doesn't state that toxic substances have evolved independently in unrelated species of plants and have survived in only a few species.
E: The passage discusses the beneficial role of secondary substances, and some toxic substances that evolved in correlation with secondary substances but may not be secondary substances themselves. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The passage describes that "increasing returns to scale" means that the bigger a factory, the more specialized its workers can be and the more productive the factory can be per worker.
A: This example describes a decrease in productivity due to reduced work standards rather than an increase in productivity due to specialization.
B: This example is about bees and a colony, but it doesn't illustrate an economic principle where a factory can gain more productivity due to scale.
C: This example is about a school district, but it doesn't illustrate an economic principle where a factory can gain more productivity due to scale.
D: This example mentions advances in technology improving the efficiency in the lobster industry, but it doesn't describe how scale of a factory or workers can increase productivity.
E: This example is about ants and colonies and doesn't describe an economic principle where a factory can gain more productivity due to scale. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The question asks for the example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as the idea that the bigger the company, the more specialized its workers can be, and the more it can produce per worker.
  A: This does not illustrate increasing returns to scale because it implies that the productivity of individual workers is improved by lowering standards, rather than by specialization and increasing scale.
  B: This does not illustrate increasing returns to scale because it involves a larger bee colony simply deploying a particular subset of bees in a more efficient manner, rather than increasing specialization of the bees and scaling up hive operations.
  C: This does not illustrate increasing returns to scale because it is focused on using the same location more efficiently to accommodate more students at once, rather than exploring the specific benefits of having larger educational institutions.
  D: This does not illustrate increasing returns to scale because it describes a case of technological innovation that could increase productivity, rather than the benefits of scaling up operations.
  E: This best illustrates the concept, since it depicts how larger scale operations enabled an ant colony to specialize more, and grow to a size that would be impossible for just one colony.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how bigger businesses tend to have lower costs and higher efficiency than smaller ones, leading to increasing returns to scale.
  A: This option does not involve increasing returns to scale and actually describes a reduction in productivity.
  B: This option does not illustrate increasing returns to scale, but division of labor in a bee colony.
  C: This option does not illustrate increasing returns to scale since it does not involve larger size leading to greater efficiency or cost savings.
  D: This option is a possible example of increasing returns to scale, where the lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps, thanks to technological advances.
  E: This option describes how a larger number of ant colonies produce more ants than a single colony could have achieved.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as "the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker."
  A: This answer choice describes a reduction in productivity, not an improvement, so it does not align with the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This answer choice does describe an increase in productivity through the division of labor, but it does not deal with scale explicitly, so it is not the best answer.
  C: This answer choice describes an increase in efficiency through increased density, but not through specialization or scale, so it does not align with the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D: This answer choice describes an increase in productivity with the same number of traps, but not through a direct increase in scale, so it is not the best answer.
  E: This answer choice describes a natural progressive increase in scale with a corresponding increase in productivity, so it aligns well with the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, where larger firms tend to have lower costs and higher production rates than smaller firms due to greater specialization of roles efficiency.
  A: The example of a publishing house relaxing its standards to employ fewer editors does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. In fact, it suggests the opposite: a decrease in returns related to lower efficiency.
  B: The example of a bee colony using guard bees does not describe increasing returns to scale, as there is no increase in efficiency or production due to the size of the colony.
  C: The example of a school district using year-round operation does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale. Although this method allows for more students in one building, it does not necessarily result in increased efficiency or higher production rates.
  D: The example of the lobster industry using traps with advanced technology does illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale, as it describes an improvement in technology that allows for higher production rates with the same resources, due to an increase in specialization and efficiency.
  E: The example of a large ant colony dividing into smaller colonies does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale, as there is no increase in efficiency or production due to the size of the colony.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The second paragraph explains the concept of increasing returns to scale. The paragraph mentions that "increasing returns to scale" refer to situations where a larger business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. The text further explains that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business until few players are left in the industry. As per the passage, the Pin Factory is an illustration of how a larger business produces more than a smaller one. The Pin Factory can achieve increasing returns to scale by allowing its employees to specialize in narrow tasks.

A: A publishing house that improves the productivity of its employees by relaxing the standards for the work quality is not an example of increasing returns to scale because it is not about achieving more through larger size.
B: The example of the bees is not an example of increasing returns either, as it illustrates using specific bees for specific tasks to improve productivity, but not as a result of larger size of the colony.
C: The situation with the school district is not about increasing returns to scale either because it doesn't illustrate a larger organization having lower costs or achieving more as a result of its size.
D: The example with lobster industry is also not related to increasing returns to scale since it's about technological advancement reducing the costs and effort required to get the same output while not indicating how larger size can produce more.

Option E is also not the best answer as it is talking about a separate feature of ant communities and not associated with the concept of increasing returns to scale discussed in the passage.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The second paragraph specifies that the Pin Factory example illustrates the increasing returns to scale, in which increasing scale results in increased efficiency and productivity per worker.
  A: The example does not involve increasing returns to scale because the productivity of the editors improves only because the standards are relaxed, which represents a decline in efficiency.
  B: Although the example refers to larger worker groups being more efficient than smaller ones, it does not involve economies of scale and it is not clear that the result is significantly greater efficiency.
  C: The example describes how more students are accommodated in an existing building, which seems to only illustrate better resource allocation rather than economies of scale.
  D: The example refers to new technology that increases productivity per trap, but there's no suggestion that productivity increases with greater numbers of traps.
  E: The example illustrates how the division of large groups of ants creates even larger groups with increased productivity per ant.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The question asks for an example that illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale. According to the passage, increasing returns to scale occur when bigger firms have lower costs than smaller firms and can, therefore, drive them out of business or dominate the industry. 

A: This example does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale, as it describes a reduction in productivity and would require an increase in the number of editors.

B: This example does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale because it describes a process of the bee colony using some bees only for guarding nectar sources. 

C: This example does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale, as it does not involve fixed costs decreasing as output increases or one firm driving smaller firms out of business or dominating the industry.

D: This example does illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale, as it mentions technological advances that allow the lobster industry to catch more lobsters a day with the same number of traps, which can result in bigger firms driving smaller firms out of business or dominating the industry. 

E: This example does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale, as it describes the growth of two competing colonies with the same number of ants rather than the benefits of having bigger firms that can drive out smaller firms with increasing scale.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The question is asking about an example that illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage.
  The passage explains increasing returns to scale with an illustrative example of a pin factory.
  Increasing returns to scale refer to the economic phenomenon where "the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker."
  The passage also explains that "only since the late 1970s has this 'underground river'--a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought--surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought." 
Options:
  A: This option discusses the productivity of editors of a publishing house. However, it doesn't illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This option talks about how a bee colony is able to collect more nectar, which enables the colony to better divide the work of processing the nectar. This represents the potential for larger colonies to gain more efficiency than smaller ones, which is similar to one aspect of increasing returns to scale. However, this does not fit the context of the passage, which discusses manufacturing/factory production rather than bee colonies.
  C: This option explains how a school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation. This represents a constant return to scale, where increasing the number of students incrementally increases the efficiency of the school district. This does not fit the context of the passage, which discusses increasing returns to scale, "the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker."
  D: This option describes how the lobster industry as a whole is able to catch more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because the doors to the traps became easier for lobsters to get through. This fits the concept of increasing returns to scale, as production efficiency increases with each additional unit of production. However, this doesn't fit the context of the passage, which discusses manufacturing/factory production.
  E: This option describes a larger ant colony dividing into two and eventually growing larger total numbers of ants than could exist in a single colony. This describes another aspect of increasing returns to scale. However, this does not fit the context of the passage, which discusses manufacturing/factory production.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
The passage describes increasing returns to scale; the bigger the business gets, the more specialized workers can be, and the more productive they can be. It also explains how increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, and therefore there must be many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power.
A: This answer choice describes reducing the workforce to increase productivity, which is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
B: This answer choice describes using some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, without reference to how this enables the colony to collect more nectar. This choice is not a good example of the concept described in the passage.
C: This answer choice describes a way to increase the capacity of a building by utilizing year-round operations and different student schedules, but it is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
D: This answer choice describes the lobster industry catching more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale, but rather improvements in technology.
E: This answer choice best describes the concept of increasing returns to scale by explaining how a large ant colony can divide to produce two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into even more colonies, which in turn produce even more ants than could have existed in one colony. This is an example where the bigger the business (the ant colony), the more specialized workers (the competing colonies) can be and the more productive they can be (more ants produced overall).

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that the sign for "sheep" is represented by a circled cross, which is an abstract symbol. No explanation is given on the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing or a potential replacement of the sign. It is also not mentioned that scientific scrutiny was not given to this sign prior to Schmandt-Besserat's work.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage mentions that the sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross.
Action: Answer("B")  
The author would be most likely to agree with statement B, that the sign for "sheep" gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning, since the passage mentions that the sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that the sign for "sheep," is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross. It also states that this abstract writing using numerous symbols has long puzzled researchers.
A: The passage does not suggest that any sign could have been replaced without a loss of significance. It explains that the writing using numerous abstract symbols puzzled researchers, and the particular sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep.
B: The passage does not compare the ways in which the sign for "sheep" and "metal" get their meaning. It only uses them as examples of how abstract symbols were used in early writings.
C: The passage does not make any comments on whether the representation of "sheep" was influenced by it being an agricultural commodity.
D: The passage mentions Schmandt-Besserat, but in regards to her research on clay tokens found at archaeological sites, not specifically the sign for "sheep".
E: The passage does not discuss the political life of the people who used the language expressed by cuneiform writing.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the writing system used in the Sumerian city of Uruk and the tokens that came prior to it. The writing system used abstract symbols to represent words and not pictographic symbols. The sign for sheep, along with others, was an abstract symbol (circled cross) that represented the word, rather than an image of the sheep itself.  
A: The author does not suggest that the sign for "sheep" can be replaced without loss of significance.  
B: The author does not compare the way the sign for "sheep" gets its meaning with any other signs. Therefore, it is incorrect.  
C: The author does not explain why the sign for "sheep" represents its meaning the way it does. 
D: The author does mention Schmandt-Besserat's theory about these tokens being predecessors to the written word, but it does not address the way the sign for "sheep" represents its meaning. Therefore, it is incorrect. 
E: The author does not mention anything about the political life of the people who used the language expressed by cuneiform writing. Therefore, it is incorrect. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the implications of recent findings in neuroscience on the way we think about the law, specifically the idea of retribution.
  Passage B discusses the compatibility of determinism with the concept of free will, and argues that actions originating from a disease-free brain can be considered free.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A suggests that recent findings in neuroscience indicate that behavior is determined by brain operations. It suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution for past harmful actions. 
  Passage B is concerned with the philosophical concept of free will and argues that actions can still be free even in a deterministic world.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
Passage A argues that people's actions are solely determined by the brain, and that free will is an illusion caused by the brain. This view implies that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterrence rather than retribution.
Passage B discusses the philosophical notion of soft determinism, arguing that free will can co-exist with determinism if actions are caused by internal sources rather than external constraints.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that free will may be an illusion and that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution in favor of focusing on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the coexistence of free will and determinism, arguing that actions are considered free as long as they are not constrained.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the law should move away from retribution and instead focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will and how we can still have free will in a deterministic world.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A suggests that according to recent findings in neuroscience, the criminal justice system should not focus on retribution, which is based on the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts. Rather, the law should focus on deterring future harms. The passage argues that people may not be making free and rational moral choices. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of soft determinism, which suggests that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely if the action is not constrained. The passage argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses how recent findings in neuroscience challenge the idea of retribution as a justification for punishment and suggest that the focus should be on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses how the concept of free will can coexist with determinism by distinguishing between free and constrained actions and arguing that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that neuroscience suggests that our actions are determined by our brain, and that beliefs about free will may be delusions. Therefore, the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution and focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B argues that determinism and free will can coexist, and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources that force someone to perform an action.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that the operations of the brain alone cause behavior, suggesting that people may actually have less free will than is commonly believed, and that this should cause a shift in the purpose of the criminal justice system away from punishment of those who commit crimes that they truly had no control over.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will, arguing that free will can coexist with determinism, depending on the source of the cause of an action.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the idea that neuroscience changes the way we think about the law due to the understanding that our behavior is caused by the operations of our brain, rather than through rational choice.
  Passage B discusses the debate on whether deterministic views, which suggest all human action is causally necessitated by events outside our control, can coexist with the concept of free will.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Knowledge:
  The passage describes two opposing positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time. One position believed that art should stand above the present and the everyday, while the other maintained that literature should only exist if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society. Dostoyevsky took a third position, claiming that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than that of the other critics. He believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.

Action: Answer("D")  
Based on the passage, Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance as long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. He defined artistry as the ability to write well and believed that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. Therefore, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.

Knowledge: 
  The passage explains Dostoyevsky's attitude towards Russian literary criticism.
  A: The passage mentions that for Dostoyevsky, there is no distinction in principle between reality and fantasy.
  B: The passage mentions that Dostoyevsky is against the argument that formal aspects of literature is secondary to its goal.
  C: The passage does not support this choice.
  D: The passage mentions that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit.
  E: The passage does not suggest that the radical critics need to explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky took a different view from the opposing literary criticism positions in Russia during his time. He believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but he also thought that reality was far more than the merely tangible. He believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  A: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believes that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. Therefore, we can infer that Dostoyevsky would not be softened if the radical critics drew a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy.
  B: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. Therefore, we can infer that Dostoyevsky would not be softened if the radical critics put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work.
  C: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source. Therefore, we can infer that Dostoyevsky would not be softened if the radical critics acknowledged the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works.
  D: The passage explains that Dostoyevsky believes that artistry is the ability to write well and that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit.". Dostoyevsky defined artistry as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, we can infer that Dostoyevsky would be most softened if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  E: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" because reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it. Therefore, we can infer that Dostoyevsky would not be softened if the radical critics explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoevsky's views on reality, fantasy, and the purpose of literature in relation to the two opposing views in Russian literary criticism at the time.
  A: The passage suggests that to Dostoevsky, there is no distinction in principle between reality and fantasy, and that the fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real. Therefore, it is unlikely that drawing a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy would soften Dostoevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view.
  B: The passage suggests that Dostoevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit, and that utilitarian claims that formal aspects of a work are secondary to its purpose are a contradiction in terms. Therefore, it is unlikely that putting clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects would soften Dostoevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view.
  C: The passage suggests that Dostoevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, and that he saw no distinction in principle between reality and fantasy. Therefore, it is unlikely that acknowledging the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works would soften Dostoevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view.
  D: The passage suggests that Dostoevsky believed a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit, and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms. Therefore, the most likely answer is D because recognition of the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works would align with Dostoevsky's view that the task of the writer is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world and that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit. 
  E: The passage does not suggest that explaining more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is would soften Dostoevsky's attitude since it is already specifically stated that Dostoyevsky believes that the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted as it is was meaningless because reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's perspective on literature.
  A: Dostoyevsky believes that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. Therefore, he would not approve of a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating a literary work.

  C: Dostoyevsky's perspective is that reality is necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it and that a writer's task is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Therefore, he would not acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works.
  D: Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," and that it fulfills a goal only if it is a fully realized artistic work. Therefore, he would most likely soften his attitude if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  E: The passage does not suggest that Dostoevsky would be softened if the radical critics explained more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is. In fact, Dostoevsky believes that the radical's demand is meaningless. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Dostoyevsky opposed the radical critics' views on literary criticism.
  The radical critics maintained that literature should be useful and serve a particular political view while Dostoevsky believed that it should be judged on its artistic merit.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality was different from the radical critics. He believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  A: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky opposes the radical critics' view that reality should be depicted "as it is". He does not want a sharp distinction between reality and fantasy.
  B: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believes that artistic merit is more important than clarity of purpose. Thus, the radical critics putting clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects would not improve Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view.
  C: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky opposed the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" and their insistence that art should serve a particular political view. Thus, the radical critics acknowledging the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works would not improve Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view.

  Dostoevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  According to Dostoevsky, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well.
  
Action: Answer("D") 

The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." He insisted that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals and that artistry is quite simply the ability to write well. Therefore, recognizing the full significance of artistic merit would be most aligned with Dostoevsky's position.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.
  E: Katherine Dunham's anthropological and choreographic expertise enabled her to make contributions that altered the landscape of modern dance in North America.

Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge:
  The passage talks about Katherine Dunham's contributions to modern North American dance in two main capacities: (1) as an anthropologist who pioneered the field of dance ethnology and (2) as a choreographer who adapted traditional Caribbean dance forms, incorporating them with modern dance styles to create new forms of ballet that were among the first North American dances to include African American themes. 

Analysis:
  Choice A inaccurately limits the scope of the passage by focusing only on Dunham's contributions to anthropology. While it is true that Dunham developed innovative research methodologies for studying traditional dance styles and connected these styles with African American dance, it is only a part of the main point of the passage. 
  Choice B correctly identifies one important aspect of the main point of the passage - that Dunham's ballets incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures - but it fails to fully capture the significance of her contributions. 
  Choice C is too narrow in scope, focusing only on the "aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers." While Dunham's work did draw on her own experiences and cultural history as an African American woman, her contributions were broader and ultimately had a more far-reaching impact on modern dance as a whole. 
  Choice D is only partially accurate. While Dunham's research did reveal the African roots of many Caribbean dance traditions, this is not the main point of the passage. 
  Choice E most accurately expresses the main point of the passage in that it encompasses both aspects of Dunham's contributions (as an anthropologist who pioneered dance ethnology and as a choreographer who created new ballets by incorporating traditional Caribbean dance forms with modern styles), and also highlights the significance of her work to the broader landscape of modern dance in North America.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The author discusses Toni Morrison's novel "Jazz" and how its narrative structure uses the idea of ensemble playing and improvisation in jazz music. The author argues that Morrison creates a similar structure of ensemble storytelling in the novel with the use of quotation marks.

11-16 lines read: "In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz band which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as if with quotation marks around their improvisations and solos."

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Toni Morrison's novel Jazz as an example of a work of literature that draws heavily from the structural techniques of jazz music.
  A: This choice is close to the truth, but goes too far in saying that the author "intentionally" tried to simulate the style of jazz performance. The language of the passage suggests that the similarities between the structure of Jazz and jazz music are more subtle and complex than this.
  B: This statement is unsupported by the passage and offers a different example of novels that draw from musical forms than the one described in the passage.
  C: This statement is too broad and absolute to be supported by the passage. The author discusses the relationship between jazz and Jazz, but doesn't suggest that all art about non-literary subjects must necessarily reflect the structure of those subjects.
  D: This statement is not related to the topic of the passage and is too broad in its scope.
  E: This statement may be true, but it is not directly relevant to the author's assertion about Jazz.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the way Toni Morrison used the structuring principle of jazz in her novel Jazz, particularly in the way it is narrated, using the metaphor of jazz improvisation and solo performances within the logic of the composer's frame.
  
  A: This statement is in accordance with the passage and what is being discussed about the narration of Jazz being inspired by the structure of jazz. 
  B: The passage mentions that "none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so," indicating that this statement is not true. 
  C: The passage does not provide evidence to support this statement, and it seems to be too broad and generalizing. 
  D: The passage suggests that the integration of music in literature is not a matter of a novel being read aloud, but rather the structure and form of the narrative. This statement is not supported by the passage.
  E: The passage does not compare the number of African American writers to non-African American writers in North America who have written novels about music, and this statement is not relevant to what the passage is discussing.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how the structure of the novel is analogous to the structure of a jazz ensemble. The narrator's voice is disembodied and shifts between third-person and first-person, representing the improvisations and solos of the musicians in a jazz ensemble. The individual musicians always perform within the logical structure of the composer's frame, just as the characters in the novel improvise within the fixed scope of the collective narration. The novel is a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which uses a musical genre as the structuring principle for the entire novel. The narration of the novel is analogous to the playing of jazz music, with ensemble sound intertwined with individual solo performances, all operating within a carefully constructed collective narration. 
A: This statement is true based on the evidence presented in the passage, but it does not contradict any of the previous assertions in the passage.
B: The passage only mentions the precedent of writers using music as theme and metaphor, but none have used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
C: The passage only focuses on the relationship between music and literature within the African American tradition and does not make any general claims about novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
D: This statement is too broad and does not relate specifically to the claims made in the passage about Jazz's unique narrative structure and its relationship to jazz music.
E: The passage does not make any comparisons between the number of African American and non-African American writers who have written novels whose plot and characters have to do with music.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz as an example of a novel that uses the structure of jazz music in its narration. Specifically, the narration of Jazz switches between third-person and first-person voices in a way that is similar to a jazz ensemble that weaves together individual solos within the entire composition. The author notes that no matter how inventive or bold the individual musicians' solos are, they always perform within the fixed structure of the composer's composition, as if there are quotation marks around their solos.
  
  A: The answer is partially true, as the passage describes how Morrison simulates the style of jazz performance in the narration of Jazz.
  
  B: The answer talks about African American novelists basing the form of their works on blues music. However, this is not relevant to the author's assertion about Morrison's Jazz.
  
  C: The answer is too broad and does not address the author's specific assertion about the structure of Jazz's narration.
  
  D: The answer is too generalized and does not address the author's specific assertion about the structure of Jazz's narration.
  
  E: The answer is also irrelevant to the author's assertion about Morrison's Jazz in particular.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's 1992 novel Jazz and its similarity in structure to the playing of a jazz band, in which there are intertwined ensemble sounds with individual solo performances.
  Lines 11-16 describe how the narrative structure of Jazz is similar to the structure of jazz music, with the narrator allowing central characters to speak but maintaining control over the narrative as a whole.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Reasoning: The author argues that "none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz" (lines 5-8). If B were true, then there would have been other African American novelists who had sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music. This would contradict the idea that Toni Morrison was the first to use music as a structuring principle in a novel and therefore call into question the author's assertion in lines 11-16. A, C, D, and E are not supported by the passage and are therefore incorrect answers.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the unique structure and style of Toni Morrison's novel, Jazz, which draws on the genre of jazz music as its structuring principle.
  The author compares the structure of Jazz to a jazz ensemble, in which individual musicians improvise within the framework of the composer's overall composition.
  The author argues that Morrison's use of multiple narrative voices and shifting points of view creates a sense of ensemble improvisation within the framework of a fixed narration.

Action: Answer("B")  
Since the question asks what the author's assertion would be most called into question if one of the answer choices were true, we need to find the answer choice that would challenge the author's argument. Choices A, D, and E do not directly address the author's argument about the unique structure and style of Jazz, while choice C is an overgeneralization that does not specifically relate to the argument about Jazz. Only choice B suggests that other African American writers had used music as the basis for the form of their work, which would challenge the author's claim that Morrison was the first African American writer to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses how Toni Morrison structured her novel "Jazz" with a style that simulates a jazz ensemble performance, with individual characters' voices and sections being set off with quotation marks, but still within the overarching narrative structure created by the narrator.
  A: This is already mentioned in the passage, and the author agrees with it by using it as evidence to support their argument that Jazz simulates a style of jazz performance.
  B: The passage only discusses Toni Morrison's "Jazz" as the first novel to use the structuring principle of a musical genre.
  C: This is a general assertion that is not discussed in the passage. 
  D: The assertion that any novel can be found to be somewhat musical is too general and not discussed in the passage in relation to the structure of "Jazz."
  E: The passage doesn't compare the number of African American writers to non-African American writers and how many have written about music.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which uses the structure and style of jazz music to frame the narrative and the characters' individual voices.
  A: This choice accurately reflects the author's assertion and the main idea of the passage - i.e., that Morrison has used the structure of jazz music to frame her novel - but the passage does not provide evidence that she did so intentionally to simulate jazz performance.
  B: Although this choice relates to African American writers and music, it does not address the specific assertion made by the author in lines 11-16.
  C: This choice contains a general statement about novels, but the passage focuses specifically on the unique structure of Jazz as an example of a novel that uses music to frame the narrative and individual voices.
  D: This choice contains a general statement that could be applied broadly to novels, but the author's assertion in lines 11-16 is more specific to Jazz and its use of jazz-like structure and style.
  E: This choice relates to novels by African American writers and music but does not address the specific assertion made by the author in lines 11-16.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
  The passage describes two sides of a debate concerning the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, and then applies an economic principle, the utility maximization principle, to show that these two sides are not fundamentally in conflict, but rather complementary. Specifically, the principle suggests that individual decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice, and that both sides of the debate can affect the utility equation that determines such decision. Therefore, choice B, which says "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them," is the best description of the organization of the passage.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage describes a debate between two sides regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. It introduces an economic principle, the utility maximization principle, which is then used to reconcile the two positions. Therefore, choice (B) best describes the organization of the passage.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage describes a debate about the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, specifically fraud. On one side of the debate are scholars who believe that societal norms and institutions influence individuals to commit crimes, while on the other side are scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. The passage then introduces the economic principle of utility maximization, which can be used to analyze an individual's rational economic choice to commit a crime. The principle shows that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, but in fact complement each other, as both increasing penalties for crimes and increasing the economic opportunities of individuals can affect the expected utility from criminal activity. Therefore, the passage describes two sides of a debate and applies an economic principle to reconcile them. Therefore, the most accurate choice is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage describes two sides of a debate regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, and it introduces an economic principle that reconciles the two positions. The economic principle of utility maximization is applied to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime and to demonstrate that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict. This principle is used to support the view that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage describes a debate about the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, with one side arguing that societal norms and institutions are responsible for these crimes, while the other side argues that individual choice is the primary factor. The passage then introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, which reconciles the two positions by showing how they can work together to reduce crime. The economic principle is applied to the two crime-deterrence methods, showing how they both affect the expected utility of committing a crime. Therefore, the best answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge:
The passage outlines a debate between two legal scholars about the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
One side believes that societal norms and institutions influence individuals who commit deliberate crimes, while the other claims that the decision to commit a crime is primarily an individual choice.
Recent legal scholarship has introduced the principle of utility maximization to reconcile these two positions.
Utility maximization can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
Both deterrence methods have the same effect of lowering the expected utility from criminal activity, ultimately making a person less likely to commit a deliberate crime.

Reasoning:
The passage begins by outlining the debate between two legal scholars and their differing views on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. It goes on to describe how recent legal scholarship has reconciled these positions by introducing the principle of utility maximization, an economic principle that can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime. The rest of the passage explains how this principle applies to both deterrence methods and makes them complementary. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them." Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage describes two sides of a debate on how to deter deliberate crimes, and then introduces an economic principle to reconcile them. It explains that this economic principle of utility maximization can be used to understand the rational economic choices of individuals and can be applied to the decision to commit a crime. The passage then shows that both sides of the debate can be effective if they are seen as complementary rather than contradictory, since they both affect the expected utility from criminal activity in different ways. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that it presents two sides of a debate and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation:
The passage describes a debate between two sides (one that believes societal norms and institutions influence individuals to commit deliberate crimes and the other that believes the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice) and an economic principle is applied to show that they are complementary. The principle of utility maximization is used to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime and show how the recommendations of both sides of the debate have the same overall effect. Thus, choice B is the most accurate description of the passage's organization.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The passage describes a debate between two sides regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. It then introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, to reconcile these two positions. The economic principle is used to analyze and explain how the two suggestions, changing societal norms and institutions and increasing fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, actually have the same overall effect of lowering the expected utility of committing a crime. Therefore, the passage primarily presents two sides of a debate and applies an economic principle to decide between them. Answer choice (B) accurately reflects this organization.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage is organized around two different positions on the best way to deter criminal behavior, specifically deliberate crimes. The author begins by describing these two positions and their proposed methods for reducing such crimes. Then, the author introduces the economic principle of utility maximization and shows how both sides of the debate are complementary and can be reconciled under this principle. Therefore, the economic principle is applied to decide between the two sides of the debate. Choice A is incorrect because although a general principle is used to resolve the conflict, it is specifically an economic principle. Choice C is incorrect because the principle is not introduced to discredit the beliefs but rather to reconcile them. Choice D is incorrect because there is no general principle described before the discussion of the two positions. Lastly, choice E is incorrect because the general principle is used to show the similarities between the two sides of the debate, not the differences.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts
  B: to present evidence that undermines a theory
  C: to provide examples that support an argument
  D: to contrast several different modes of expression
  E: to enumerate specific instances in which a phenomenon recurred
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of most scholarship on Native American autobiographies, which has focused on written accounts and overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communication. Prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures, the idea of self in Native American cultures was different than in European cultures, and the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history, and artifacts such as tattoos, shields, robes, and tepees could be autobiographical expressions. The autobiography was shaped not merely by individual ideas but also by cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
 
Analysis: 
  The third paragraph provides examples that support an argument - the idea that “within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events… one person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime” and that “[such] intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph of the passage discusses the various modes, such as dance, drama, artifacts, songs, chants, and even language, that were used by Native Americans to communicate their personal histories. 
  A: The text does not refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts.
  B: The text does not present evidence that undermines a theory.
  C: The text provides examples that support the idea that Native Americans had different modes of communication.
  D: The text does contrast different modes of expression
  E: The text does not enumerate specific instances in which a phenomenon recurred.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The third paragraph presents examples of traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history among certain Native American cultures. The author suggests that scholars have overlooked such modes and failed to take into account the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples.
A: While the third paragraph does go into some detail about examples of Native American artifacts that are autobiographical in nature, it does not refute any traditional interpretations of those artifacts. 
B: The third paragraph does not present evidence that undermines a theory.
C: The third paragraph provides examples that support the author's argument that scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
D: The third paragraph contrasts traditional, preliterate modes of autobiographical expression with the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime.
E: While the third paragraph does present specific instances of Native American art and artifacts that conveyed personal history, it does not enumerate all of the instances in which such a phenomenon recurred.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph describes the various traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history among Native American peoples.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
The  third paragraph provides examples that support the argument that scholars have overlooked various traditional modes of autobiography used by Native Americans because the scholars had a narrow conceptualization of the term autobiography based on European assumptions about self, life, and writing. By offering examples of the ways in which Native Americans communicated their personal histories prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures, the paragraph supports the author's main argument that scholars need to be more inclusive when studying Native American autobiographical materials.
Response 4:
Knowledge: The third paragraph describes specific modes of preliterate oral autobiography such as songs, chants, stories, dramatic performances, tattoos, artifacts, and tepees which were fragmented, communicative and animated by the tribal community. It observes how autobiography and expression were shaped by individual and cultural perspectives, with a markedly inclusive receptiveness to society and the cosmos. The paragraph distinguishes pre-contact Native American modes of autobiography from European models of autobiography by revealing their divergences from the concept of a life story as constituted by one's assumptions about self and writing, but which could still convey personal and cultural narratives.
Action: Answer("C")  
The third paragraph provides multiple examples that support the argument and illustrate the traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history that were characteristic of some Native American cultures.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how scholars have overlooked oral forms of Autobiography in Native American culture and culture constructs that are different from European constructs.
  The third paragraph provides examples of how the oral autobiography in Native American cultures worked.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
The third paragraph describe specific examples to support the broader argument made in the passage that there existed traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history in Native American cultures that scholars have overlooked.
Response 6:
Knowledge: The third paragraph describes the traditional, preliterate modes of communication used by Native American cultures to convey personal history and experiences. It emphasizes that scholars have overlooked such modes of expression in favor of written life histories.

Action: Answer("C") 

The function of the third paragraph is to provide specific examples that support the argument that Native American autobiographical expression was not limited to written documents. The paragraph describes various modes of oral expression such as dance, drama, storytelling, tattoos, shields, and tepee paintings that were used for conveying personal history. Thus, (C) is the correct answer.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The third paragraph of the passage describes different modes of expression used by some Native Americans to communicate their personal history, which were not focused on writing like European autobiographies. It emphasizes that these expressions were inclusive and oriented toward current events. The paragraph provides examples of how this form of communication was manifested in different artifacts used by Native Americans.
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 8:
Knowledge: The third paragraph provides examples of traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history among Native American peoples, and describes how expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events, with the participation of fellow tribal members. It explains that within these cultures, the expression of life experiences was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. The paragraph suggests that autobiography in these cultures was not a singular, lifelong document, but rather a collaborative process involving the collective expression of a person's experiences.
Action: Answer("C")  
The third paragraph provides examples that support the argument that traditional Native American cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography, and that the expression of life experiences in these cultures was markedly different from European customs of writing down the recollections of a lifetime.
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage describes the traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history and how Native American autobiographical expressions were shaped by their cultural perspectives. The third paragraph describes several modes of traditional Native American expression including songs, chants, stories, drama, tattoos, and pictographic records that can be viewed as autobiographical.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The third paragraph provides examples that support the argument that traditional Native American autobiographies were conveyed through modes of expression other than writing and were oriented towards current events. As such, it functions to support the broader argument of the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of the planet Neptune located in the precise location needed to remedy discrepancies between calculations based on Newton's laws and the observed orbit of Uranus.
  A: This passage does not involve the discovery of a new celestial object. It's about Galileo's theory of tides and its incorrect prediction.
  B: This passage describes Hubble's discovery of the Milky Way and Andromeda as separate galaxies and not about Neptune and Uranus.
  C: This passage describes the extinction of the dinosaurs and not about the discovery of Neptune and Uranus.
  D: This passage describes Bernard Brunhes discovering rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field and not about the discovery of Neptune and Uranus.
  E: This passage does not involve the discovery of a new celestial object. It's about Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of a third undetected particle to explain the conservation of energy in a neutron decay process that was later confirmed.

Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about other planets, but the predictions were not accurate. One possible explanation was that there was another planet close enough to Uranus to affect its orbit. Later, Neptune was discovered in the precise place it would need to be, leading to increased confidence in the correctness of Newton's laws.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides did not involve incorrect predictions about other planets or a need for additional planet(s) to explain its accuracy.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a separate galaxy did not involve the need for additional planet(s) to explain its accuracy.
  C: Walter Alvarez's discovery of high levels of iridium in certain rock core samples did not involve predicting the presence or location of another planet, but rather explaining a past event.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of reversed magnetization in rocks did not involve predicting the presence or location of another planet, but rather a physical phenomenon on Earth.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that attempts to classify risks as "voluntary" or "involuntary" should not be the primary guide for regulatory policy, and that departures from attempts to save as many lives as possible should be justified by more specific considerations.
A: The author does not express an opinion on whether people should be protected against risks incurred through socially useless activities such as skydiving.
B: The author argues that experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, whereas laypeople care whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily or not. People's perception of voluntariness can stem from confusion and selective attention, and is of little utility in guiding policy decisions.
C: The passage does not provide information on the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury for the various risks incurred by airline passengers.
D: The author argues that the concept of "voluntary" risk is not an all-or-nothing matter, and that people's perception of voluntariness can stem from confusion and selective attention, and should not serve as the primary guide for regulatory policy.
E: The passage suggests that unforeseeable natural disasters may be an example of risks incurred involuntarily, but the author does not make the claim that this is the main category of involuntarily incurred risks. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage mainly talks about the distinction between "voluntary" and "involuntary" risk judgments and how they do not provide much utility in guiding policy decisions. The author supports governmental policies that aim to save as many lives as possible, taking into consideration the available public and private resources.
A: The passage does not express a clear opinion on this statement.
B: The passage implies that policy experts would consider the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
C: The passage does not provide information to support or refute this statement.
D: The passage talks about how judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention. However, for public-policy purposes, the author suggests that the distinction between "voluntary" and "involuntary" risks is of little utility. According to the author, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, and policy decisions should aim to save as many lives as possible, subject to the available public and private resources.
E: The passage mentions the example of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid as an example of a risk that is incurred completely involuntarily. It does not provide information on whether natural disasters are the main category of risks that are completely involuntary. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the concept of voluntary and involuntary risk and how it affects the judgments of laypeople and policy experts about risk.
  A: The author discusses that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. Also, the author notes that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. The author does not express a clear agreement or disagreement with the statement.
  B: The author discusses that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, but laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. The author also notes that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention. Additionally, the author notes that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. Therefore, the statement may be reasonably inferred as true.
  C: The passage does not provide information about the comparison between the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury for different kinds of risks incurred by airline passengers.
  D: The author explains that voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Also, it is mentioned that people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. Hence, the statement is not accurate.
  E: The passage indicates that risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. However, they can choose airlines based on safety records or choose not to fly. The author also notes that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention. Therefore, the statement is not true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how people make judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" or "voluntary" and that these judgments are not always useful for guiding policy decisions. The author argues that a better understanding of the factors underlying judgments about voluntariness is needed and that regulatory policy should be focused on saving as many lives as possible.
  A: The author discusses how people sometimes categorize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the activity for which people run the risk. There is no indication that the author believes that people should generally not be protected against risks incurred through dangerous activities.
  B: The passage does not discuss the views of policy experts about the relevance of the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly.
  C: The passage does not provide information to support the claim that plane crashes are the risk with the highest probability for airline passengers.
  D: The author argues that categorizing a risk as "voluntary" or "involuntary" is not a useful way to guide policy decisions. The author suggests a different criteria for guiding policy decisions: saving as many lives as possible.
  E: The author briefly mentions that risks incurred through natural disasters are completely involuntary, but this is not the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the distinction between "voluntary" and "involuntary" risks is not straightforward and has limited use in guiding policy decisions. The author suggests that policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
A: The author does not explicitly express an opinion on whether people should be protected from risks associated with dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose.
B: The author argues that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, but the public judges risks by whether they are incurred voluntarily or involuntarily. The passage does not state whether the author would agree with policy experts or the public in this case. 
C: The passage makes no comparative statements about the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury for different kinds of risk.
D: The author argues that "voluntariness" is not a clear-cut distinction, and policy should not be determined based on this distinction. Instead, policy should be guided by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies. The author suggests that departures from attempting to save as many lives as possible should be justified by these specific considerations, not by notions of voluntariness.
E: The passage does not make this claim about the main category of involuntarily incurred risks.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks may not be a useful basis for guiding policy decisions because judgments about voluntariness often stem from confusion and selective attention. Instead, the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
A: The author does not express a belief that people should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
B: The author suggests that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake and do not care whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. The author also characterizes people's judgments about the voluntariness of risks as stemming from confusion and selective attention, and suggests that regulatory policy should not be guided by notions of voluntariness.
C: The passage does not provide information supporting the claim that the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
D: The passage suggests that judgments about when a risk is voluntarily incurred are complex and not all-or-nothing. Risks incurred by airline passengers might be considered involuntary but not completely so because people can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. The author argues against using notions of voluntariness to guide regulatory policy.
E: The passage does not provide information supporting the claim that the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about how people tend to categorize risks as voluntary or involuntary based on whether the risk is incurred voluntarily or involuntarily, but that it is not a clear-cut distinction.
  The author also suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. 
A: The passage doesn't address whether people should or should not be protected against risks incurred through activities that are dangerous and have no socially useful purpose.
B: The passage suggests that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, but it is unclear whether or not they would consider the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly as relevant to decisions about regulating air safety.
C: The passage doesn't provide information to support the claim that plane crashes are more likely to occur and more likely to cause death or injury than any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
D: The passage discusses the difficulty of determining when a risk is voluntarily incurred and suggests that voluntariness is not a clear-cut distinction.
E: The passage doesn't support the claim that the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary vs. involuntary risks is often illusory, and that regulatory policy should be based on a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. The author also argues that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.

A: The author does not express an opinion on whether people should be protected against the risks incurred through activities like skydiving. The author instead argues that the notion of "voluntariness" is often illusory and should not be the sole consideration in regulatory policy.
B: The author argues that policy experts do indeed tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, but that laypeople care more about whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. The author does not express an opinion on whether policy experts deem the voluntariness of an activity to be irrelevant to regulating safety standards.
C: The author does not provide information to support this inference.
D: The author argues that the notion of "voluntariness" is often illusory and should not be relied on as the sole criterion for determining whether a risk is voluntarily incurred. The author does suggest that one way to think about voluntariness is to consider whether people are subject to a risk only if they make a particular choice, but this is not the same as saying that this criterion should be used as the sole determinant of whether a risk is voluntary.
E: The author does not express an opinion on which categories of risk are usually incurred involuntarily.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk and argues that it is not a useful basis for making policy decisions. The author suggests that regulatory policy should focus on saving as many lives as possible while taking into account limited public and private resources.
A: The author does not express a clear opinion on whether people should be protected against dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose.
B: The author suggests that policy experts tend to focus less on whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily and more on the aggregate lives at stake. However, the passage also suggests that characterizing a risk as "involuntary" may not be particularly useful for guiding policy decisions.
C: The passage does not make any comparative statements about the probability of occurrence or probability of resulting death or injury for different kinds of risks, including plane crashes vs. other risks incurred by airline passengers.
D: The author argues that determining whether a risk is voluntarily incurred is not always straightforward, and that judgments about voluntariness are often based on selective attention or antecedent judgments of some other kind. The author also suggests that whether a risk is deemed voluntarily incurred or not should not be a major factor in guiding policy decisions. Therefore, the author is unlikely to agree with this statement.
E: The author suggests that while some kinds of risks, such as unforeseeable natural disasters, may be completely involuntary, most other kinds of risks fall on a spectrum of voluntariness that is not black-and-white. However, the author does not make a definitive statement about which category of risk is usually completely involuntary.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary risk is not useful in guiding policy decisions. The government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind.
A: The author believes that the purpose of the risky activity should not be the sole criterion to determine protection against risks or government intervention. However, the author does not make any specific comments about skydiving in the given context. Therefore, this option cannot be inferred from the passage.
B: The author argues that distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary risk is not useful in guiding policy decisions. Therefore, it can be inferred that the fact that the victims chose to fly will not have much weightage in policy decisions about air safety. This aligns with the option B.
C: The given passage does not provide any information or comparison on the probability of occurrence and death or injury for plane crashes and other airline passenger risks. Therefore, this option cannot be inferred from the passage.
D: The author identifies that distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary risks is often difficult and not a useful distinction for guiding policy decisions. The author considers a risk as voluntarily incurred when people are subject to that risk only if they make a particular choice. Therefore, this option aligns with the author's argument and can be inferred from the passage.
E: The passage does not make any comments about the risk of natural disasters or categorizing the risks based on the degree of voluntariness. Therefore, this option cannot be inferred from the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.
  B: Researchers' funding is often contingent on whether they can produce a patentable product.
  C: Researchers see no incompatibility between unfettered basic research and the granting of biotechnology patents.
  D: Researchers increasingly believe their intellectual labor is being unfairly exploited by universities that partner with for-profit corporations.
  E: Most researchers prefer a competitive model of scientific research to a communal model.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - The ozone layer filters much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere.
  - Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) react chemically and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  - Molina and Rowland's research showed how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, resulting in the Montreal Protocol of 1 987 to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
A: It is mentioned in the passage that "In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium." Therefore, the statement is not strongly supported by the information in the passage.
B: It is mentioned in the passage that "ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer". Therefore, the statement is partially supported but not the most strongly supported by the information in the passage.
C: It is mentioned in the passage that "Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)...chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation." However, it is not mentioned that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere. Therefore, this statement is not supported by the information in the passage.
D: It is mentioned in the passage that "the ozone layer filters much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere" and "Regulating the use of CFCs" led to the development of an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. Therefore, this statement is the most strongly supported by the information in the passage.
E: It is not mentioned anywhere in the passage that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica. Therefore, this statement is not supported by the information in the passage. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The depletion of the ozone layer is due to the action of manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer leads to an increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere, which destroys ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms, leading to further depletion of the ozone layer.
  The work of Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, who pioneered research into the ozone layer and depletion, led to the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica and the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  A: The passage does not state this; In fact, it states that natural production and destruction of ozone gas should be in rough equilibrium, in the absence of pollutants.
  B: The passage states that ultraviolet light contributes to skin cancer, but it does not state that this is the primary cause of skin cancer.
  C: The passage does not state this. It only refers to manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and how they result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: The passage supports this statement. The depletion of the ozone layer contributes to an increase in the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches the surface of the Earth, which can lead to skin cancer. The banning of CFCs reduces the depletion of the ozone layer and thus, indirectly, contributes to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The passage does not state this. It only refers to the work of Molina and Rowland leading to the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the depletion of ozone in the atmosphere due to the presence of manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  A: The passage does not provide strong support for this statement. It is mentioned that chlorine and ozone interact in the atmosphere to deplete ozone, but it is not clear if ozone destruction can happen naturally.
  B: The passage mentions that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer, but it does not suggest that skin cancer occurs primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: The passage discusses CFCs as one type of chemical that can contribute to the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere. It does not suggest that CFCs are the only type of chemical that can cause this effect.
  D: The passage discusses how the depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs allowed for more ultraviolet radiation to reach the earth's surface, contributing to skin cancer. Therefore, this statement is a supported claim in the passage.
  E: The passage mentions a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica but does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the research of Molina and Rowland that led to the discovery of how CFCs contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, which serves as a shield against ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer. 
  A: The passage describes how naturally occurring ozone production and destruction occur in rough equilibrium over time, but does not suggest that this process involves the presence or absence of chlorine.
  B: While excessive absorption of ultraviolet light can contribute to skin cancer, the passage specifically states that ultraviolet radiation can cause skin cancer and that the ozone layer serves as a shield against this radiation.
  C: The passage does suggest that other chemicals besides CFCs can release chlorine in the upper atmosphere that can cause ozone depletion.
  D: The passage directly states that the regulation of CFCs contributed to the development of more environmentally friendly chemicals, but it does not directly link this regulation to the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The passage does not mention that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how stratospheric ozone is depleted by the release of CFCs, which contain chlorine that can destroy ozone molecules.
  A: The passage does not explicitly state that no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere without chlorine, so this statement cannot be strongly supported by the information given.
  B: The passage discusses how skin cancer is caused, in part, by ultraviolet light that penetrates the ozone layer. While this statement is supported, it is not the most strongly supported statement in the passage.
  C: The passage does not mention any other chemicals besides CFCs that can release significant amounts of chlorine into the upper atmosphere, so this statement cannot be strongly supported.
  D: The passage discusses how the regulation of CFCs led to the reduction of their release into the atmosphere, which contributed to slowing the depletion of the ozone layer. Since the depletion of the ozone layer contributes to the increased penetration of ultraviolet radiation that causes skin cancer, it can be inferred that the regulation of CFCs does have an indirect impact on lowering the incidence of skin cancer. Therefore, this statement is the most strongly supported by the passage.
  E: The passage mentions the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, but it does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  UV radiation contributes to skin cancer, and much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone in the stratosphere.
  Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which reacts chemically with ozone and destroys it.
  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  The work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
Action: Answer("D")  
The passage provides evidence that regulation of the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer because the destruction of the ozone layer by CFCs results in higher levels of ultraviolet radiation, which contributes to skin cancer. Therefore, Answer D is the most strongly supported statement in the passage.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) attack and deplete the protective ozone layer in the stratosphere causing an increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere, which destroys the ozone molecules and increases skin cancer risk from ultraviolet radiation exposure.
  A: The passage does not suggest that no ozone destruction occurs without chlorine in the stratosphere. Rather, it suggests that in the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time.
  B: While the passage acknowledges that ultraviolet radiation contributes to skin cancer, it does not suggest that this is the primary cause of skin cancers.
  C: The passage does not mention any chemicals besides CFCs that release chlorine in the atmosphere. Therefore, it is not possible to tell whether this statement is true or false.
  D: The passage describes how decreasing the use of CFCs contributed directly to the prevention of a further reduction in the ozone layer, which, in turn, prevents a higher incidence of skin cancer from ultraviolet radiation exposure. Therefore, this statement is most strongly supported by information in the passage.
  E: The passage does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Action: Answer("D")

A: The passage states that "Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms." However, it does not suggest that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present. Therefore, this statement is not strongly supported by the passage.
B: The passage states that "it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer," and that the ozone layer serves as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. However, the passage does not suggest that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light. Therefore, this statement is not strongly supported by the passage.
C: The passage discusses how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can release chlorine in the upper atmosphere and lead to the depletion of the ozone layer. However, it does not suggest that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere. Therefore, this statement is not strongly supported by the passage.
D: The passage suggests that the depletion of the ozone layer due to the use of CFCs can contribute to skin cancer, as ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. The passage also discusses how regulating the use of CFCs led to the development of an international agreement to ban ozone-depleting gases. Therefore, this statement is strongly supported by the passage.
E: The passage does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica. Therefore, this statement is not strongly supported by the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Question: The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" (lines 18-19) for which one of the following reasons?
Choices:
  A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics
  B: to illustrate the influence of religion on the historical development of art
  C: to present an example of the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist
  D: to show how an artist can subvert the ideals of the patron
  E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: 
The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The passage explains that the creation of art can happen in two ways: for display by an artist and for creating a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life (commissioned work). Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments were commissioned by Pope Julius II as a work of art that mirrored his ideals and way of life. However, the passage states that not all art created for the elite fits the patterns or conforms to the ideals of sociohistorical critics.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

The author refers to Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not necessarily fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The author argues that not all art commissioned by the political and social elites was necessarily produced for the purpose of expressing their ideals and way of life. Instead, sometimes artists were able to find a place in the margins of the establishment, and a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Therefore, the correct answer is E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")

The reason the author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" is to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics, as stated in the passage: "The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments commissioned by Pope Julius II. Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist." (lines 15-21)
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The author mentions that the sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced by the governing class or well-to-do middle class, which expresses their ideals and way of life. However, Raphael was commissioned by Pope Julius II, who was the head of the Catholic Church and not part of the aristocratic or well-to-do middle class. Therefore, the relationship between Raphael and his patron does not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics and shows that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern. Hence, the correct answer is E.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses two different ways in which art was historically "produced by and for political and social elites." 
    - The first was by engaging a well-known artist to produce something for display. 
    - The second was creating or having created a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments is mentioned to provide an example of the second way.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")

The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" (lines 18-19) as an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics. Specifically, the frescoes were created for a patron from the elite class, and the sociohistorical critics analyze how they embody the ideology of the elite. Therefore, the best answer is A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, but they don't simply reflect his ideals and way of life. Instead, they express Raphael's ideals and way of life. Raphael was an artist who was able to find a place in the margins of the establishment - engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes. This example suggests that artists sometimes have a degree of freedom to express their own ideas and values, even when they are working for an elite patron. Therefore, the answer is E, to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")

The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics. The author explains that the second way in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites" was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life. Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments, commissioned by Pope Julius II, exemplify this type of art, where the works express the ideals and way of life of the pope.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example that shows that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the typical pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. The frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, but they express Raphael's own style and perspective, not solely that of the Pope. Thus, the frescoes reflect a unique relationship between the artist and the patron, which does not fit within the standard model of sociohistorical analysis. Therefore, the best answer is E, "to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics."
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

The author mentions "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments" (lines 18-19) to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics. While some art was produced for the specific purpose of displaying the wealth and taste of a patron, other works expressed the ideals and way of life of the patron. The example of Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments illustrates the latter type of relationship, as they were created to express and mirror Pope Julius II's ideals and way of life. Therefore, the correct answer is E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:
Knowledge: The author argues that defense lawyers have an obligation to both the defendant and the court/society, and that lawyers should not knowingly present false or insincere claims to the court. If the lawyer is convinced that the defendant is guilty, they should not try to demonstrate their innocence, but try to present extenuating circumstances, and argue for leniency in sentencing. If the lawyer is uncertain whether the client is guilty, but sincerely believes they may be innocent, then the lawyer should try to prove the client is innocent. 
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The sentence at lines 28-31 expresses agreement in general with the earlier position - that lawyers have an obligation to the defendants - but disagreement over the particulars - that lawyers have no right to judge defendants. The author believes that lawyers have a twofold obligation - to the defendant and to the court/society. Therefore, the answer is D - disagreement over the particulars.
Response 1:
Analysis:
  The passage discusses the nature of defense lawyers' obligations to their clients, the court, and society. Specifically, the responsibilities of defense lawyers, especially in situations in which they perceive their clients to be guilty, are discussed. The passage also contrasts the roles and responsibilities of defense lawyers with the obligations of the court.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Explanation: 
  The information at lines 28-31 introduces an opinion that agrees with the earlier position that defendants are entitled to the best possible legal representation and that lawyers should not express or act on personal opinions. However, the information at lines 28-31 disagrees with the earlier position on the particulars of lawyers representing guilty clients. The passage states that lawyers' obligations to the court and society should preclude them from presenting assertions they know to be false. Therefore, Answer D, "agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars," is the best answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 describes the position of some legal scholars who believe that the sole obligation of lawyers is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 assert that lawyers who know with certainty that a defendant is guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence and should only present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
Action: Answer("D")  
The sentence at 28-31 agrees with the earlier position that lawyers should not judge defendants and should provide the best defense they are capable of, but disagrees over the particulars, asserting that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their clients' innocence if they know with certainty that the client is guilty.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers, and argues that they should not knowingly present false or insincere claims. Instead, in cases where they are convinced of their client's guilt, they should focus on appraising the case and presenting any extenuating circumstances that might warrant leniency in sentencing. In cases where there is uncertainty, lawyers should work to prove their clients' innocence.

Action: Answer("D") 
The sentence at lines 28-31 discusses the author's agreement with a position mentioned earlier in the passage, but with some variation. In particular, the earlier position states that defense lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best possible defense, while the later sentence clarifies that their obligation is twofold and involves also keeping the best interests of the court and society in mind. So, there is an agreement between the two sentences in general, but also some disagreement over the particulars.
Response 4:
The first sentence in lines 28-31 states that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate innocence of guilty defendants and that guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. This statement is addressing the question of whether defense lawyers must believe in the innocence of their clients. The statement at lines 7-11 reports the argument of legal scholars that defense lawyers have no obligation to believe in the innocence of their clients, but rather to provide the best defense possible. 
Knowledge: 
  Lines 7-11 report the opinion of some legal scholars that defense lawyers are not obligated to believe their clients' innocence. 
  Lines 28-31 state that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their guilty client's innocence. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Lines 7-11 describe the perspective of some legal scholars, who contend that defense lawyers have no right to judge defendants, but should provide the best legal representation possible. They argue that it is the courts' responsibility to determine guilt or innocence. 
  Lines 28-31 state that when lawyers know their clients are guilty, it is their duty to appraise the case and present any extenuating circumstances, rather than deny the client's guilt. 
Action: Answer("D") 
The answer is D because the information in lines 28-31 agrees in general with the position of the legal scholars in earlier lines about a defense lawyer's responsibility, but disagrees over the specific approach the lawyer should take when defending a guilty client.
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage talks about the responsibility of defense lawyers towards their clients, the court, and the society. The author argues that lawyers have a twofold obligation towards their clients and the court.
The information at lines 28-31 states that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their client's innocence if they know with certainty that the client is guilty. Instead, they should appraise the case in their client's favor and then present any extenuating circumstances. This statement refers to the lawyer's obligation towards the court and society.
Action: Answer("D") 
The sentence at lines 28-31 agrees in general with the earlier position that lawyers' obligation is twofold, but it disagrees over the particulars of defending guilty clients.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
The author argues that a lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court and, by extension, to society. Lawyers should not present assertions they know to be false, even if it is in defense of their clients. However, when it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer believes the client may be innocent, the lawyer should try to prove their innocence. 
A: The described relationship is not accurate since both statements are related and not unrelated.
B: The described relationship is not accurate since the author is not opposing another opinion here.
C: The described relationship is not accurate since there is no hypothetical situation presented here.
D: The described relationship is the most accurate since the author agrees with the earlier position, but disagrees with the idea of presenting false assertions.
E: The described relationship is not accurate since the assertions are not essentially equivalent and it does not arise from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Lines 28-31 state that in cases where the lawyer is unsure of their client's guilt or innocence but sincerely believes they may be innocent, they should try to prove the client’s innocence. The statement in the earlier lines of the passage states that some legal scholars claim that lawyers’ only obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, without judging the defendant, and to act as an advocate, saying only what the defendant would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. 
Action: Answer("B") - the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines.
Response 9:
The sentence at lines 7-11 provides a position held by some legal scholars who argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants and that their sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?
  C: What kinds of messages and pieces of wisdom are most often communicated by proverbs in the English-language tradition?

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses the development of an alternative theory for the communication between neurons (brain cells) in the brain. This theory suggests that instead of electrical signals, communication is achieved through a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule, and helps generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell. The passage discusses how researchers have discovered the structure of receptors that mediate the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity and how they function as ion channels. Finally, it highlights the significance of this discovery in developing targeted treatments for specific brain disorders.

Action: Answer("D") 
The primary purpose of the passage is to discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the evolution of scientific thinking about how neurons communicate with each other and how neurotransmitters mediate the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity in the brain.
  The initial theory that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons across synapses has been replaced by the theory that neurotransmitters secreted by an excited neuron bind to the corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron and render it permeable to ions, leading to the generation of an electrical impulse that transmits the message to the receiving neuron.
  Recently, researchers have discovered that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity, and they have isolated several types of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that conform to this structure.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: The author of the passage refers to "self, life, and writing" (lines 12–13) most probably in order to
Choices:
  A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas
  B: define a word that had a different meaning for early Native Americans than it has for contemporary Native Americans
  C: illustrate how words can undergo a change in meaning after their introduction into the language

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence
  E: countering a revolutionary hypothesis
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the misconception held by scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages that wine is not different from beer or distilled spirits and has rarely been investigated as a distinct drink, despite the fact that wine has been thought to have healthful effects for centuries.
  Recent studies have shown that moderate wine consumption (both red and white) has healthful effects on the heart (ameliorating the thickness of innermost walls of blood vessels and reducing the platelet adhesiveness) and reduces the levels of lipids in the blood responsible for premature heart disease. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is discussing findings of recent small group of researchers who have investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages, which have been more extensively studied scientifically.
  The researchers found that wine has health benefits, including decreased deaths due to premature heart disease, and increased activity of certain compounds that may help prevent heart disease.
  The findings may be due to the concentration of natural compounds in grapes not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how most scientists have assumed that wine has the same effects on the body as other drinks that contain alcohol, which has obscured the potential health benefits of moderate wine consumption. The author then provides evidence and explanations for why moderate wine consumption might have healthful effects, particularly for heart health. 
A: The author does not advocate for a particular method of treatment.
B: The author does not criticize popular opinion; rather, the author critiques scientists for not making distinctions among different types of alcoholic beverages and not studying moderate wine consumption.
C: Correcting a scientific misconception is the main focus of this passage: the author argues that previous studies on alcohol have not adequately considered the unique health effects of moderate wine consumption and have obscured potential health benefits of wine.
D: The author is not questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence; rather, the author presents evidence from both recent and past studies to argue for the health benefits of moderate wine consumption.
E: The passage does not discuss countering a revolutionary hypothesis.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
The author discusses the physiological effects of wine compared to other alcoholic beverages, specifically its potentially healthful effects. Most scientists had assumed that wine, like other alcoholic beverages, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol, so they did not investigate the effects of wine as a distinct alcoholic beverage. The author, however, discusses the effects of moderate wine consumption on the body, and how it appears to have ameliorating effects on various physiological factors that affect the development of premature heart disease. The author discusses the different contributing factors to premature heart disease and their relation to wine consumption. 
Action: Answer("C") 
The author is primarily concerned with correcting a scientific misconception about the effects of wine as a distinct alcoholic beverage and discussing the physiological effects of wine when consumed moderately, which differs from the effects of excessive or abusive consumption of alcoholic beverages, and how that may relate to the development of premature heart disease and the factors that contribute to it.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: The passage mainly discusses how studies about wine consumption can differ from what scientists have traditionally assumed about the physiological effects of alcoholic drinks and how these studies have led to new findings about the potential health benefits of moderate wine consumption. Therefore, the correct answer choice is C, correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage examines the health benefits of wine to counter the common misconception that wine has the same physiological effects as other forms of alcoholic beverages.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses the scientific misconception that wine was thought to have the same negative effects as other forms of alcohol, and how recent research has demonstrated potentially healthful effects from moderate wine consumption.

Explanation: The author is primarily concerned in correcting a scientific misconception.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the assumption among most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol.
  The passage also discusses how a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption.

Action: Answer("C") 
The primary concern of the author in this passage is to correct a scientific misconception held by most scientists who until recently studied the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. The author discusses how wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that most scientists' studies of alcohol had obscured because they did not make any distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits and studied only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages. The author describes how a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption, and how they found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. The author also describes how there is evidence that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on various factors that are linked to the development of premature heart disease.  Therefore, the best answer is C.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, using subtraction to highlight areas of differential metabolic activity within the brain, while obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  A: This analogy does not accurately represent the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity.
  B: This analogy does not accurately represent the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity.
  C: This analogy does not accurately represent the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity.
  D: This analogy does not accurately represent the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity.
  E: This analogy accurately represents the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity: just as the cheetah is the fastest land animal only for short distances, FMRI scans highlight areas of differential metabolic activity within the brain while obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans are interpreted as the result of subtracting a baseline measurement taken in a control condition from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task. This subtraction is intended to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the task.
  
A: This choice is about identifying a district that made a difference in an election. It does not show the subtraction method that FMRI scans use. Incorrect.
B: This choice talks about advertisements affecting shoppers only during the summer. It does not show the subtraction method used in FMRI scans. Incorrect.
C: This choice is about water supply and the relative use of water by different customers. It does not show the subtraction method that FMRI scans use. Incorrect.
D: This choice talks about internet traffic being highest during evening hours with most of the traffic being from homes rather than office buildings. This does not show the subtraction method used in FMRI scans. Incorrect.
E: This choice is about the cheetah and how it is fast over short distances, but can not outrun another animal, over the long term. It does not show the subtraction method that FMRI scans use. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations and potential flaws of the use of brain scans in psychology research, particularly the modular theory of mind.
  The FMRI scan is actually a result of a subtraction method that subtracts the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement, in order to isolate metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The entire brain is active in both the control and cognitive task conditions, but the subtractive method produces an image that gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
The FMRI scan is interpreted based on the differential rate of oxygen use before and during a cognitive task. The baseline rate is subtracted from the on-task rate to isolate activity that is attributable to the task. This is analogous to how an advertising campaign is interpreted based on differences in shoppers before and after the campaign. The false impression of neat functional localization in the FMRI scan is similar to how the advertisement is assumed to only affect summer shoppers. Therefore, the answer is B. None of the other choices share a sufficiently similar analogy to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the limitations and potential problems with interpreting FMRI scans of brain activity. 
  Specifically, the method used to interpret FMRI scans involves subtracting the brain activity during a baseline (control) measurement from the activity during a cognitive task, such that the resulting image only shows the brain activity associated with the task. 
  The passage suggests that this method may obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and that the modular theory of mind may be attractive because it is illustrated by the products of the subtractive method.
  A: This choice involves the idea of a specific district being responsible for a larger contribution to an election outcome, similar to how a specific area of the brain is thought to be responsible for a particular cognitive task. However, this choice does not incorporate the subtractive method discussed in the passage for interpreting FMRI scans. 
  B: This choice involves the idea that a particular factor only affects a subset of a population, similar to how a cognitive task may only activate a particular area of the brain. However, this choice does not incorporate the subtractive method discussed in the passage for interpreting FMRI scans.
  C: This choice involves the idea that one group is affected more severely than another by a particular situation, similar to how different areas of the brain may be activated differently during a cognitive task. However, this choice does not incorporate the subtractive method discussed in the passage for interpreting FMRI scans. 
  D: This choice involves the idea that a particular activity or behavior is more likely to occur in one location compared to another, similar to how particular areas of the brain may be involved in certain cognitive tasks. However, this choice does not incorporate the subtractive method discussed in the passage for interpreting FMRI scans.
  E: This choice involves the idea that a particular trait or ability is useful only in certain situations, similar to how different areas of the brain may be activated preferentially during different cognitive tasks. However, this choice does not incorporate the subtractive method discussed in the passage for interpreting FMRI scans. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The article explains that FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain by subtracting the on-task measurement from the baseline measurement. 
  The article suggests that the idea of neatly separating brain function into localized, independent modules (the modular theory of mind) may not be accurate or complete. The entire brain may be active regardless of the cognitive task being performed. 
  The question asks for an analogy to the manner in which FMRI scans are typically interpreted. 
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The manner in which FMRI scans are interpreted is by a method of subtraction, where the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement. This manner of interpretation highlights the difference in oxygen use between the two measurements and suggests that areas "lighting up" are due to the cognitive task being performed. However, this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. Choice B provides an analogy where a store launches a yearlong advertising campaign and sees an increase in shoppers only during the summer. The increase in shoppers during the summer is attributed to the advertising campaign even though the campaign was present throughout the year. Thus, the analogy is that the method of subtracting out the baseline measurement is a way of attributing specific brain activity to a task even though the brain is active in both conditions.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the methods and difficulties associated with interpreting functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans.
  FMRI scans involve subtracting a baseline cognitive state from the state during the performance of a specific cognitive task, with the idea being that the remaining difference can be attributed to that specific task alone.
  This method may obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both cognitive states, producing a false impression of precise functional localization.
  Analogies are comparisons that explain complex ideas by comparing them with familiar ones.

Action: Answer('B')
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage describes functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) as a method that relies on a subtraction process to identify which parts of the brain are responsible for different cognitive tasks. A baseline measurement of oxygen use in the brain is subtracted from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task, and the resulting differences are interpreted as the metabolic activity associated only with the cognitive task at hand. However, the passage argues that this subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and that the modular theory of mind may not accurately reflect how the brain operates.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task and attributing any differences to the task at hand. Similarly, option B describes how an increase in shoppers during the summer is attributed to a year-long advertising campaign, by assuming that the change in shopping behavior during the summer was due solely to the advertising campaign.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a research method that measures the metabolic activity, measured by the use of oxygen, of different parts of the brain.
  FMRI uses a baseline and on-task measurement to determine the differential rate of oxygen use, which theoretically highlights the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, which produces a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, which may or may not be valid.

Action: Answer("B")
Explanation: 
  The manner in which FMRI scans are interpreted, with the use of a baseline measurement and an on-task measurement, is most analogous to option B where a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer. The advertisements were assumed to have affected only the summer shoppers since the increase was only observed during the summer. Similarly, the differential brain scans attempt to account for metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question by subtracting out the baseline measurement, giving a false impression of neat functional localization.
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage describes how the interpretation of an FMRI brain scan involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task. Whatever remains is thought to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task. This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and it can give a false impression of neat functional localization. 
A: This analogy is not similar to the description of FMRI scans in the passage.
B: This analogy is not similar to the description of FMRI scans in the passage.
C: This analogy is not similar to the description of FMRI scans in the passage.
D: This analogy is not similar to the description of FMRI scans in the passage.
E: This analogy is similar to the FMRI scans in the passage, as it describes a situation where a particular entity is thought to excel at a particular task or function, but only when considered over a particular domain. 
Action: Answer("E")

  The passage describes the manner in which functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  FMRI scans are a method of assessing brain activity by measuring blood flow to different areas of the brain.
  FMRI scans involve a subtractive method that compares brain activity during a cognitive task to a baseline measurement of brain activity during a control condition.
  The FMRI scan maps the differential rate of oxygen use, and the resulting areas of metabolic activity are typically interpreted as specific brain areas responsible for particular cognitive functions.
  However, this interpretation may be problematic because the entire brain is active in both conditions, and it is unclear whether cognitive functions are discrete modules localized in specific areas of the brain.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.

Knowledge:
  The second version of multicultural education advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and using Western scientific methods.
  Critics argue that the Western scientific heritage and its methods of examination, study, and explanation of other cultures are already value laden, and thus this approach is not essentially different from the first version that uses majority culture’s perspectives, methods, and values. 
  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures do not privilege the modes of thought and language of non-Western cultures.
  The objection is to the use of Western science to study other cultures that may have different modes of thought and language.

Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. 
   
A. This statement suggests that the critics would hold that members of a culture with different values cannot understand the social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values. The paragraph states, however, that the critics argue that each culture should be taken on its own terms and that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. 
  B. This statement is consistent with the view expressed by the critics discussed in the paragraph. 
  C. The paragraph suggests that the critics would hold that understanding other cultures solely through the methods of Western science is distorting and an expression of cultural chauvinism. The paragraph, however, does not directly suggest that the critics would agree with this statement. 
  D. This statement contradicts the view expressed by the critics discussed in the paragraph. The paragraph states that the critics argue against approaching other cultures solely by the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. 
  E. This statement restates the view expressed by the critics discussed in the paragraph. Critics would argue that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western and that it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. The objection also argues that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first because the methods of examination derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this objection argue that adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is the only way to achieve real understanding.

A: This choice is incorrect because it argues that members of one culture cannot understand another culture's values. The objection discussed in the second paragraph does not go this far, as it argues that it is necessary to adopt the cultural perspectives and methods of the culture studied in order to achieve real understanding.

B: This choice is correct. The objection in the second paragraph explicitly states that the value systems of non-Western cultures have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, so understanding those circumstances is crucial to understanding their values.

C: This choice is incorrect. The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western, though they should be adopted from the cultures studied.

D: This choice is incorrect. The objection in the second paragraph explicitly argues that it is impossible to understand other cultures through the lens of the majority culture's values and perspectives.

E: This choice is incorrect. Although the objection argues that the methods of Western science may not be adequate for studying some cultures, it does not imply that the values of liberalism cannot be understood through science. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The question asks for the option that related to the critics who raise objection discussed in the second paragraph. The second paragraph of the text discusses a critique of the second version of multicultural education that argues that the Western scientific heritage and its methods bias understanding of non-Western cultures. According to this view, the neutral stance toward cultural values of the second version of multicultural education does not make it essentially different from the first version, which takes a liberal stance.
  
  A: This does not relate to the main point made by the critics discussed in the second paragraph.
  
  B: This does not directly relate to the main point made by the critics discussed in the second paragraph, but it is consistent with the notion that social and historical circumstances shape a culture's values.
  
  C: This is not the main point made by the critics discussed in the second paragraph. This option proposes a further step in the critique that is not supported by the passage.
  
  D: This is not the main point made by the critics discussed in the second paragraph. Also, this option contradicts the view of proponents of the first version of multicultural education that promoting understanding of other cultures is possible even when they do not share all the same values.
  
  E: This is consistent with the critique of the second version of multicultural education discussed in the second paragraph. Critics of this approach object that a neutral stance still incorporates bias toward the Western scientific heritage and its values.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The objections of the critics of the second version of multicultural education suggest that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are value-laden and that understanding of another culture might be impossible unless that culture is studied from its own perspectives and methods.
  A: This statement contradicts the critics' objection. The critics argue that understanding other cultures from a single Western perspective is inadequate, but this does not mean that members of different cultures cannot understand each other's social and historical circumstances.
  B: This statement reflects the position of the critics. They argue that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures should be informed by the social and historical circumstances that shape those cultures.
  C: This statement is not raised by the critics in the passage. Although the critics argue that examining other cultures from a single perspective is inadequate, they do not suggest that this means that cultures should be studied from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: This statement is not supported by the passage. The critics argue that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible if it is studied solely from within the context of the majority culture's perspective. However, they do not suggest that different cultures need to share the same cultural values.
  E: This statement is not presented by the critics in the second paragraph. While the critics argue that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures might be inadequate when dealing with non-Western cultures, they do not suggest that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood by the methods of Western science.

Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The objection to the second form of multicultural education is that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version are still identifiably Western and are already value laden. Critics argue that the choice to understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity, which is not shared by all cultures.
A: The argument does not state that the social and historical circumstances of a culture cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values. Therefore, this is not the best answer.
B: This statement is true, but it isn't the main point of the objection that the critics are raising. Therefore, this is not the best answer.
C: This statement is not explicitly stated in the paragraph, therefore, this is not the best answer.
D: The critics do not argue that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values. Therefore, this is not the best answer.
E: This statement reflects the main point of the objection raised. Critics of the second form of multicultural education argue that Western scientific methods of study are not adequate to understand non-Western cultures and that adopting the methods of Western science involves a commitment to certain values that not all cultures share, and that using these methods is an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.

  Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The second paragraph presents criticisms of the second version of multicultural education, which advocates for a neutral stance toward the value differences among cultures, but still uses Western methods to study different cultures.
- The critics argue that the Western scientific heritage and methods involve a commitment to certain values, and they may not adequately account for the values, perspectives, and methods of other cultures.

Analysis:
- The question asks which answer choice is most likely to be agreed upon by critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph.
- Answer choice A refers to the idea of cross-cultural understanding, but it does not quite capture the objection raised by the critics. Some critics argue that it may be possible to understand the social and historical circumstances of other cultures, but the understanding may not be adequate if it is limited to Western scientific methods and values.
- Answer choice B reflects a claim that is not in opposition to the critics' objection, but it does not capture the objection either.
- Answer choice C may be appealing to those who emphasize the importance of multiple perspectives in understanding other cultures, but it is not specific to the critics' objection to the use of Western scientific methods and values.
- Answer choice D is contradicted by the critics, who argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is possible even if those cultures do not share the same cultural values as the majority culture.
- Answer choice E is the best match for the critics' objection. They argue that the values of liberalism (such as democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons) cannot be adequately understood by simply applying Western scientific methods. Therefore, a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism is maintained by trying to impose Western methods on non-Western cultures. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the characteristics and functions of primary and secondary substances in plants and how they relate to the evolutionary interactions between plants and insects. It also discusses how the preferences and adaptations of insects have led to a narrowing of suitable food sources and the characteristic tastes and smells of plants.
A: The passage discusses the defensive function of some secondary substances against plant-eating insects, but it also discusses how other secondary substances serve to attract pollinating insects or dissuade insects from feeding. This choice is too narrow to capture the main point of the passage.
B: This choice accurately reflects some of the discussion in the passage, but it does not encompass the entire scope of the passage. The passage also discusses the chemical composition of plants, the process of natural selection, and the variety of secondary substances as they relate to insects and other environmental pressures. 
C: This choice accurately captures the central idea of the passage, which is how secondary substances in plants have evolved as a result of natural selection due to the interaction between plants and insects. The passage gives detailed information about the role these substances play in attracting pollinators, deterring insects from feeding, and acting as biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects. 
D: This choice is partially accurate, but it is too narrow to capture the full scope of the passage. While the passage does note that related plants tend to have similar secondary substances, the discussion is much broader and relates to how these substances evolved as a result of selective pressures from insects and other factors.
E: This choice is partially accurate, as the passage does relate the development of secondary substances in plants to an ongoing process of competition with plant-eating insects. However, it does not capture the full scope of the passage, which also discusses how these substances interact with pollinators and have evolved due to genetic mutations and natural selection. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage provides information about the chemical composition of plants and the role of secondary substances in plants. It states that secondary substances give plants their distinctive taste and smell and have different functions such as being biochemical defenses against insects or signaling pollinating insects. It also mentions the evolutionary competition between plants and insects for survival. 
A: This choice accurately describes the role of secondary substances in plants as natural defenses against insects, which is mentioned in the passage, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage.
B: This choice accurately describes the narrowing of the range of secondary substances in plants and insect species that eat each species of plant, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage.
C: This choice accurately captures the main point of the passage, which is that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants result from the evolutionary interaction between plants and insects. It also highlights the role of secondary substances in plants and how they have different functions.
D: This choice accurately describes the diversity of secondary substances in plants and their similarity among closely related species, which is mentioned in the passage, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage.
E: This choice accurately describes the role of plant mutations in the development of secondary substances and the ongoing competition between plants and insects, which is mentioned in the passage, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge: 
The main idea of the passage is to discuss the relationship between plants and plant-eating insects and how it has led to their coevolution.
A: Although secondary substances in plants act as natural defenses against insects, this does not capture the full meaning of the passage.
B: While this choice is somewhat correct, it is not the most accurate. It does not mention that secondary substances are what provide distinctive tastes and smells to plants.
C: This choice best captures the main point of the passage. The passage discusses how secondary substances in plants give plants their tastes and smells, as well as mentioning how plants and insects have co-evolved over time.
D: While this choice is true, it is not the main point of the passage.
E: While this choice mentions the process of competition between plants and insects, it does not mention the role of secondary substances in co-evolution, which is the main point of the passage.
Therefore, the best answer is C.

B: The statement is true and mentioned in the passage, but it does not express the main point of the passage.
C: The statement accurately expresses the main point of the passage. The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. 
D: The statement is true, but it does not express the main point of the passage.
E: The statement is partly true but is not the main point of the passage. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge: 
The passage is about the relationship between plants and insects, and how the chemical compositions of plants attract or repel insects. The passage explains that plants contain primary and secondary chemical substances, where secondary substances give the plants their distinctive smells and tastes, and that these secondary substances arise through genetic mutation. The passage has explained the role of insects in the occurrence of secondary substances in plants, and how the harsh effect of plant defenses and detoxification mechanisms pose a threat to insects. 

A: Although the passage discusses the role of secondary substances as a natural defense mechanism against insects, it does not express that this is the main point. 
B: This answer may be a bit too narrow. Although the process of narrowing plant-insect associations is mentioned, this is not the main point of the passage. 
C: The passage explains how the particular secondary substances that different plants possess, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. This answer accurately reflects the main point of the passage. 
D: Although this answer mentions the diversity and similarity of secondary substances among closely related species, it is not the main point of the passage.

Therefore, the answer is C.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
The passage explains how secondary substances in plants give them their taste and smell, and how insects have interacted with plants in the evolutionary process to develop defensive secondary substances. Insects have also developed ways to identify these secondary substances that don't harm them.

A: Although it is true that certain secondary substances in plants protect against damage from insects, this does not express the main point of the passage.
B: The passage does discuss how the range of secondary substances has narrowed over time, resulting in a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant, but this is not the main point.
C: The paragraph explains that secondary substances have given plants their distinctive tastes and smells and were developed in the interaction between plants and insects through evolutionary processes.
D: This statement is true, but it is not the main point of the passage.
E: The passage does illustrate that plant mutations results in secondary substances in plants which have led to an evolutionary competition with plant-eating insects. However, this is not the main point of the passage.

Therefore, the answer is C.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: The passage mainly discusses how the secondary substances found in plants contribute to their characteristic taste and smell, and how the presence of these substances have resulted from an evolutionary interaction between plants and insects. The passage also notes that some secondary substances attract pollinating insects to blossoms, while others act as defense mechanisms against plant-eating insects. Thus, the best summary of the main point of the passage is that the distinct tastes and smells of plants are largely due to an evolutionary process between plants and insects. Choice (C) best captures this idea.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge: The passage explains the role of secondary substances in plants such as giving rise to distinct fragrances and tastes. These substances are mainly responsible for protecting the plants from being damaged by insects and also act as defenses against plant predators. Insect’s preferences for plants with suitable defenses by means of their ability to smell, taste, and recognize plant-specific volatile chemicals are also discussed. 

The best answer choice is (C) "The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects." as this accurately describes the main point of the passage. The passage talks about how plants have evolved to produce secondary substances as a natural tool for defense specifically against insects and how insects use smells and tastes to identify and circumvent these defenses.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the differences between primary and secondary substances in plants. 
  Secondary substances are responsible for the distinct taste and smell of plants, and are believed to have evolved through an interaction between plants and insects.
  Some secondary substances are defenses against insects, while others serve to attract pollinating insects.
  The competition between plants and insects has resulted in a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the chemical composition of plants and the role of secondary substances in the development of distinctive tastes and smells that deter insects from feeding on them. The influence of insects on plant evolution and the evolutionary competition between plants and insects are also discussed.

Explanation:
The main point of this passage is that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants, which are due to secondary substances, are largely the result of an evolutionary interaction between plants and insects. Insects have played a major role in the development of these substances by forcing plants to evolve defenses against them. The fact that closely related plants tend to have similar secondary substances supports this idea. The other answer choices are either partially correct or do not accurately summarize the main point of the passage. Answer A is correct in suggesting that secondary substances in plants provide defenses against insect damage, but it fails to mention the evolutionary aspects of the process. Answer B is true in describing the effect of long-term competition on plant substances, but does not account for the evolutionary factors discussed. Answer D correctly describes the secondary substances as numerous and diverse but fails to address the evolutionary subject matter. Answer E suggests that plant mutations are the sole cause of the competition between plants and insects, which is inaccurate. Hence, the best answer is C.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins
  B: endorse a claim simply because it is widely believed
  C: accept a claim for the sake of argument
  D: attempt to resolve an apparent paradox
  E: assert that their positions are supported by data
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses research concerning happiness and wealth, including the phenomena of habituation and rivalry.
  Passage B challenges the idea that people are mainly interested in one-upmanship and suggests that people feel happier when they feel like they have created value.

  The passage A explains a paradox regarding happiness and wealth and proposes two aspects that push up the norm when people compare their income with others. The passage also contends that how people compare to their reference group is crucial for happiness.
  The passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful and that they have created value. The passage also contends that what scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author of Passage A argues that there is a paradox between wealth and happiness where richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people, but over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. The author then explains the phenomenon by discussing the impact of habituation and rivalry on people's perception of their income levels.
  The author of Passage B offers an alternative explanation to the paradox mentioned in Passage A by arguing that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful and have created value. The author suggests that wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The author of Passage A explains how money affects happiness through the phenomena of habituation and rivalry, and how people compare themselves with their reference group.
  The author of Passage B argues against the common belief that people care most about one-upmanship, and instead argues that people are happy when they feel they are successful and have created value.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how people's happiness and satisfaction with income is influenced by social comparison and how relative position affects an individual's happiness.
  Passage B discusses why earning more makes people happier and how we use material wealth to show that we are successful and create value, which benefits society.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A and Passage B discuss the issue of wealth and its relationship to happiness. The author of passage A focuses on the paradox between happiness levels and increased wealth, while the author of passage B focuses on the ability of wealth to provide a sense of success and the creation of value. 
A: Passage A and B do not discuss biological origins. 
B: Passage A and B do not endorse a claim solely because it is widely believed. 
C: Passage A and B do not accept a claim for the sake of argument. 
D: Both Passage A and Passage B present arguments that aim to resolve an apparent paradox regarding happiness and wealth. 
E: Both Passage A and Passage B assert that their positions are supported by data. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A and B express different arguments around the relationship between wealth and happiness, with A highlighting particular phenomena such as habituation and rivalry to explain a paradox, and B arguing for a theory whereby earning more money makes people feel more successful and therefore contributes to happiness.
A: Passage A cites phenomena such as habituation and rivalry to explain a paradox concerning the relationship between wealth and happiness. While biological origins are not directly discussed, the passage identifies that people compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income, suggesting that biological tendencies could play a role in people's evaluations of their happiness. However, this is not a primary point for either author.
B: Passage B cites data to argue that earning more money makes people feel more successful and therefore contributes to happiness, rather than endorsing a claim simply because it is widely believed. The author also mentions alternative theories but argues that these are not best supported by the evidence, implying that the author is selective based on the evidence. 
C: While passage A identifies a paradox and passage B counters this with an alternative hypothesis, neither is accepting a claim for the sake of argument. Both authors are trying to develop their own perspective.
D: Passage A identifies a paradox and presents phenomena that contribute to it, while Passage B presents an alternative theory that aligns with the data. While both authors identify a tension or apparent paradox around wealth and happiness, neither is attempting to resolve this paradox so much as explain it or offer alternative perspectives. 
E: Both authors appeal to data and evidence to support their claims. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage A talks about how the comparison with the relative income affects happiness over time and why people are motivated to maximize their income, whereas passage B discusses why the academic perception of happiness as the result of "one-upmanship" is wrong and how the desire to create value benefits society.
  A: Out of the two passages, neither of the author explains a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins.
  B: Out of the two passages, neither of the author endorses a claim simply because it is widely believed.
  C: Out of the two passages, neither of the author accepts a claim for the sake of argument.
  D: Both the authors attempt to resolve an apparent paradox in their respective positions.
  E: Both the passages make claims that are supported by data.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The question asks about the argument of the authors of passages A and B.
  A: The author of passage A discusses habituation and rivalry as two phenomena that push up the norm for the income that people require to be happy. The author also explains that people's reference group is crucial for their happiness.
  B: The author of passage B argues that earning more makes people feel successful and that success provides happiness, which is supported by data.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Both passages provide contrasting views on factors influencing happiness and wealth.
  Passage A claims happiness over time has not increased in advanced societies, and that people perceive their current income in relation to an ever-growing reference group.
  Passage B conjectures that happiness is derived from a sense of success and creating values.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial
  D: theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions
  E: speculate that creating credibility in some cases is probably more effective than positively framing very harmful information
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create to indicate that early information can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
  The author mentions that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that inform their opinions during trials, but this is not the primary focus of their discussion of cognitive frameworks.
  The author suggests that stealing thunder may be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively.
  The author does not theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions; rather, the author suggests that early volunteering of damaging information may create an image of credibility.
  The author does not speculate that creating credibility in some cases is more effective than positively framing very harmful information.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create primarily to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information, using the early positive framing to inform their evaluation.
  A: This choice correctly reflects the author's explanation of the purpose of the cognitive framework that jurors create.
  B: The author mentions this idea briefly, but it is not the primary purpose of the discussion of the cognitive framework.
  C: While the cognitive framework is related to the impact of presenting evidence early in the trial, the author specifically discusses the positive framing of evidence, not simply whether it is presented early or late.
  D: The author mentions early presentation as a factor, but this choice incorrectly suggests that stealing thunder is always best done as early as possible.
  E: While the idea of creating credibility is mentioned, this is not the primary purpose of discussing the cognitive framework.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Passage B differs from passage A in that analogous displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more
Choices:
  A: engaged
  B: dismissive
  C: detached
  D: ironic
  E: skeptical
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that neuroscience challenges the traditional idea of retribution in the criminal justice system and instead, suggests focusing on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
Action: Answer("C") 
 - Passage A is arguing for a specific change in the criminal justice system whereas Passage B is discussing a philosophical concept without explicitly arguing for anything, suggesting a detached attitude toward the ideas it discusses.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues for a view of the law based on the idea that individuals do not have free will because their behavior is determined by their brains, while passage B suggests that free will can coexist with determinism, focusing on the concept of "soft determinism."
  A: "Engaged" implies a personal interest and involvement in the ideas discussed. Passage A displays a strong position but does not necessarily show personal interest or involvement.
  B: "Dismissive" means showing a lack of interest or respect. Passage B does not show a lack of interest or respect toward the ideas in passage A. 
  C: "Detached" means free from emotional involvement or bias. The tone of both passages is academic, but the argument in passage A implies a stronger engagement with the subject matter than passage B.
  D: "Ironic" means expressing the opposite of what is expected. Neither passage is ironic.
  E: "Skeptical" means having doubts or reservations. This best describes the attitude in passage B, which points out the limitations of determinism and argues for the coexistence of determinism and free will. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that the findings in neuroscience suggest that the law should focus on deterring future harms and abandon the idea of retribution as a justification of punishment
  Passage B makes a case for how free will can coexist with determinism by distinguishing between free and constrained actions.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Passage B appears to be presenting Ayer's theory as a way to reconcile determinant and free will rather than explicitly engaging with the ideas in passage A. Therefore, the attitude toward the ideas discussed in Passage B seems to be more detached than engaged, dismissive, ironic, or skeptical.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that behavior is entirely caused by the brain rather than rational choice, and proposes that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harm rather than punishing bad people.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in a deterministic world and presents Ayer's theory of "soft determinism". The passage argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, even though they may be determined.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that the brain is the only cause behind human behavior and that the law should focus on deterrence rather than retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism, and argues that actions originating from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free.
Action: Answer("C")  
Passage B takes a detached tone, discussing the ideas in a straightforward manner, whereas Passage A takes a more engaged tone, advocating for a specific approach to the law based on recent scientific findings.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that free will might really be an illusion and that since the operations of the brain are the only determining cause of behavior and that bad people should not be punished for their freely chosen immoral acts.
  Passage B presents a theory of determinism and free will by arguing that free actions are unconstrained by external sources, and in a healthy brain, actions are not constrained.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that neuroscience and recent findings change the way we think about the criminal law and calls for a shift away from retribution towards deterrence. 
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will, and argues that actions can still be considered free if they are not constrained by external sources. The author does not discuss the criminal law.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that neuroscience findings should lead to a focus on deterrence rather than retribution in the criminal justice system.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and argues that actions can be free even in a deterministic world.
Action: Answer("C")  
Passage A takes a clear position on how the law should change based on recent findings in neuroscience, while Passage B provides a theoretical framework to understand the concept of free will. Passage B discusses Ayer’s theory of “soft determinism” and confines its discussion to conceptual arguments without expressing a strong position on the issue, giving the impression of a more detached attitude toward the ideas discussed. Thus, the answer is (C) detached.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses how recent findings in neuroscience change how we think about the law. It suggests that the criminal justice system should abandon the idea of retribution as it is not a good deterrent against future harm.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will coexisting with determinism. It argues that actions originating from a disease-free brain are free.
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that people may not have free will and suggests that the legal system should focus on deterrence instead of retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in the face of determinism and presents Ayer's theory of "soft determinism".
Action: Answer("C")  
Passage A presents an argument on how the legal system should change given the evidence about free will and neuroscience. Passage B is discussing a philosophical concept and presents Ayer's theory, but it does not strongly engage with or express an attitude toward the concepts it discusses. Thus, Passage B displays a detached attitude, different from the engaged attitude of Passage A. Therefore, the answer is (C) detached.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of
Choices:
  A: respect
  B: empathy
  C: indifference
  D: disappointment
  E: scorn

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education, with one arguing that examination of other cultures should use the methods and values of the majority culture, while the other argues that each culture should be taken on its own terms, with Western scientific methods being too Eurocentric.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the objection to the second version of multicultural education. 
  B: This choice is not relevant to the objection to the second version of multicultural education.
  C: This choice suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value systems when studying cultures, which does support the idea that cultures can be studied independently of the Western scientific perspective.
  D: This choice is not relevant to the objection to the second version of multicultural education.
  E: This choice supports the idea that understanding another culture is necessary for appreciation, but it is not relevant to the objection to the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the proposals for multicultural education.
  The first version advocates for teaching about other cultures from the majority culture's perspective that is typically based on liberal values.
  The criticism against the first version claims that this approach is limited because other cultures have different value systems that cannot be fully appreciated if examined only from the majority culture's perspective.
  The second version advocates for adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures by using Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures that derive from the Western scientific perspective.
  The criticism against the second version is that the Western scientific methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are already value-laden and impose a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism that distorts the true understanding of other cultures.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals/versions of multicultural education.
  The first version suggests teaching other cultures using the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture.
  The second version suggests adopting a neutral stance towards different cultures and using Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures.
  Critics of both versions argue that understanding other cultures is impossible without adopting the perspectives and methods of those cultures.
  
A: This statement indicates that adopting the perspectives and methods of other cultures is impossible for outsiders and hence supports the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. Therefore, this choice cannot be the answer.
B: This choice does not address the argument in the passage and is irrelevant to the question. Therefore, this choice cannot be the answer.
C: This choice weakens the criticism of the second version of multicultural education by suggesting that non-Western societies use their own value system when studying different cultures. However, it does not provide a strong objection to the criticism that adopting Western methods is not enough to understand different cultures. Therefore, this choice cannot be the answer.
D: This choice is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. Therefore, this choice cannot be the answer.
E: This choice supports the criticism made in the passage that understanding another culture is necessary for a genuine appreciation of that culture. However, it does not provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. Therefore, this choice cannot be the answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. 
  The first version promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures from the context of the majority culture and the values of liberalism.
  The second version promotes multicultural understanding by adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still uses Western scientific methods to examine cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that Western scientific methods are already value-laden and are not appropriate for examining non-Western cultures.

Action: Answer("E")
Option E, "Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture," is the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education presented in the passage. It supports the argument that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is crucial for achieving a genuine understanding of these cultures, which is necessary for adequate appreciation.
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage distinguishes between two versions of multicultural education. The first version suggests that multicultural education should proceed from within the context of the majority culture. The second version advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. According to critics of the second version of multicultural education, methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value laden which involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. This version is not essentially different from the first because of this objection. 
A: It is irrelevant to the argument in the passage as the passage does not consider this possibility. 
B: While this might be true, it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 
C: This option suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures with different values, but it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 
D: This option also does not address the criticisms leveled against the second version of multicultural education. 
E: This option, as stated, supports the claim that the understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, but it does not provide an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage presents two versions of multicultural education. The second version holds that multicultural education should adopt a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures. The methods of examining cultures in this version of multicultural education are still Western, which involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Critics argue that Western scientific heritage prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical, which makes it difficult to gain a real understanding of non-scientific cultures.
  
A: This choice might weaken the objection that adopting Western methods of examination is an expression of cultural chauvinism. However, it does not seem to support the second version of multicultural education or address the concerns against it. Therefore, it is not the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage.
B: This choice might suggest that some cultures share what might be considered Western values. However, it does not seem to support the second version of multicultural education or address the concerns against it. Therefore, it is not the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage.
C: This choice suggests that non-Western societies use their own value systems when studying cultures with different values. This implies that those societies are using their own methods of examination, which might suggest that sometimes adopting methods from one culture to understand another culture could be valuable. Therefore, this could be the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage.
D: This choice is not directly related to the concerns raised against the second version of multicultural education, and it does not seem to support the second version of multicultural education either. Therefore, it is not the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage. 
E: This choice might weaken the objection that adopting Western methods of examination is an expression of cultural chauvinism. However, it does not seem to support the second version of multicultural education or address the concerns against it. Therefore, it is not the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
The second version of multicultural education holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures, in this version of multicultural education, are still identifiably Western. Critics argue that this second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first, which examines cultures through the majority culture's perspective.
To respond to this criticism, it would need to be shown that there is a way to adopt non-Western points of view that could lead to a genuine understanding of cultures that is not value-laden or Eurocentric.
A: doesn't weaken the criticism because it suggests that adopting a non-Western perspective may not be possible. 
B: is irrelevant to the argument.
C: shows that some non-Western societies can use their own value systems to study other cultures but does not address the issue of how to gain real understanding of non-Western cultures. 
D: is irrelevant to the argument because it deals with understanding Western culture, not non-Western cultures.
E: supports the criticism but does not provide a response to it.
Action: Answer(None of the Above)
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education, with the first proposal promoting learning about other cultures through the lens of the majority's culture and the second proposal arguing for a neutral stance and adoption of non-scientific perspectives and methods. The passage also notes that critics of the second proposal argue that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second proposal are still identifiably Western and thus not essentially different from the first proposal.
  
A: This statement is not relevant to the objection to the second proposal discussed in the passage.
B: This statement is also not relevant to the objection to the second proposal discussed in the passage.
C: This statement acknowledges that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, but it does not address the criticism of the second proposal in the passage.
D: This statement is not relevant to the objection to the second proposal discussed in the passage.
E: This statement reiterates the importance of genuine understanding of another culture, which is discussed in the passage, but it does not provide a strongest objection to the criticism of the second proposal discussed in the passage.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage presents two versions of multicultural education: the first version seeks to promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures using the methods and values of the majority culture; the second version holds that each culture should be understood on its own terms, but still uses Western scientific methods, which are value-laden, to study those cultures. Critics of the second version argue that this is not essentially different from the first, because it is still rooted in Western scientific methods and perspectives.

A: This statement is irrelevant to the debate between the two versions of multicultural education.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the debate between the two versions of multicultural education.
C: This statement weakly suggests that some non-Western societies may use their own value system when studying other cultures, but it doesn't directly address the central issue of the debate.
D: This statement is not relevant to the debate between the two versions of multicultural education.
E: This statement supports the idea that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for appreciating that culture, which is a central argument made by critics of the second version.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The passage describes two versions of multicultural education advocated by different groups of educators. The second version holds that the values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms, but should still be examined using Western scientific methods. Critics of the second form of multicultural education argue that Western scientific methods are value-laden and cannot adequately capture the perspectives of non-Western cultures.

A: This statement is irrelevant to the objection to the second version of multicultural education. It does not address the issue of whether Western scientific methods are adequate for understanding non-Western cultures.
B: This statement is also irrelevant to the objection described in the passage. The argument is not that non-Western societies are all vastly different, but that Western scientific methods cannot fully capture their perspectives and value systems.
C: This statement suggests that some non-Western societies may use their own value systems when studying different cultures. However, it does not address the objection that Western scientific methods are not adequate for understanding non-Western cultures.
D: This statement is not relevant to the objection to the second version of multicultural education described in the passage. It deals with understanding Western culture, not non-Western cultures.
E: This statement seems to support the objection to the second version of multicultural education, but it does not directly address the issue of whether Western scientific methods are adequate for understanding non-Western cultures.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the music of Arnold Schoenberg, how it evolved through three different styles and what makes it unique and essential is that it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.

Action: Answer("B")  
Because the passage states that, "What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before," and hence, there seems to be an implicit comparison being made between Schoenberg's music and another form of expression that might disturb in a similar manner. If we look at option B, it suggests that the humor of a comedian who shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore can be considered disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing in a disquieting and recognizable emotional state. Thus, option B is the correct choice.
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses Arnold Schoenberg's musical style, which was often seen as disturbing due to its dissonance and challenging qualities, but also praised for its emotional depth and technical mastery. The passage notes that Schoenberg's music "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses how Arnold Schoenberg's music was initially controversial because it altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. The passage suggests that Schoenberg's music remains disturbing because it accurately and unflinchingly conveys new and difficult emotional states through music.

  The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths and precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  A: A comedian who relies heavily on vulgar humor might disturb some people, but it does not necessarily follow that they are expressing difficult truths or breaking new ground in comedy.
  B: A comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore might disturb some people, and it could be said that they are expressing difficult truths, but it is not clear that they are breaking new ground in comedy.
  C: A comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians might not disturb people, but it is not clear why they would be disturbing in the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  D: A comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy might disturb some people, but it is not clear why they would be disturbing in the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  E: A comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience could be initially jarring and unexpected, but it is not clear why they would be disturbing in the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage talks about Arnold Schoenberg's music and how it evolved into three different musical styles. It explains that his music became more condensed and more difficult to follow but what makes his music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.

Action: Answer("B") 
Choice B could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54. Just as Schoenberg's music unflinchingly faces difficult truths, this comedian's humor that shines a light on aspects of human nature that many people would prefer to ignore can be disturbing or uncomfortable.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
Response 0:
Knowledge:  
  The third version of multicultural education holds that any cultural value system should not be judged based on any standard created by a different culture, and the methods of understanding other cultures employ are Western scientific methods.
  A: Multicultural education advocates compare and contrast different cultures, so this study would not be objectionable.
  B: Understanding what a culture admires would not be objectionable and it is a part of multicultural education.
  C: This answer is correct because the critics of this version of multicultural education argued that employing Western scientific methods to study different cultures is distorting and contributes to a cultural chauvinism.
  D: This would not be objectionable to the proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in paragraph three.
  E: Criticize the values of Western culture is not the goal of multicultural education, so this would not be objectionable.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education that advocates for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures but still employs the methods of Western science to examine cultures.
  There is criticism of this second version due to the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version being still identifiably Western.

Action: Answer("C") 
According to the passage, proponents of the second version of multicultural education that advocates for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures but still employs the methods of Western science will most likely object to "a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture." Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The first version of multicultural education proposes that students should learn about other cultures, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but the methods of examination are still identifiably Western.
  Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden; thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. 
  The discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes two versions of multicultural education which have been proposed to teach multicultural understanding.
  The first version proposes to teach about other cultures using the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture (typically liberalism).
  The second version proposes to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and use the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage.
  The critics of the second version argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden, and trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but maintaining a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education. 
  The first proposal advocates teaching about other cultures using the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture (which are typically those of liberalism such as democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons). 
  Critics argue that this approach is not effective as it does not capture non-Western values and that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. 
  The second proposal argues that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures where each culture should be taken on its own terms but still uses the methods of Western social sciences. 
  Critics argue that these methods are still value-laden, and using the methods of Western science is an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The third paragraph presents a critique of the second version of multicultural education, which involves adopting a neutral stance toward cultural differences and using Western methods of examination. Critics argue that using the methods of Western science is not sufficiently respectful of non-Western cultures and can be an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  A: The passage does not provide information about how proponents of the third version of multicultural education would view a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies.
  B: The passage does not provide information about how proponents of the third version of multicultural education would view a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires.
  C: The passage suggests that proponents of the third version of multicultural education would find objectionable the use of Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  D: The passage does not provide information about how proponents of the third version of multicultural education would view a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values.
  E: The passage does not suggest that proponents of the third version of multicultural education would view a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture as objectionable.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses different proposals for multicultural education and their critiques. 
  The third proposal claims that to achieve real understanding one must adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  The critics of the second version of multicultural education believe that insisting on analyzing non-Western cultures by the methods of Western science is an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. 
  The proponents of the third version of multicultural education believe that to achieve real understanding of other cultures one must adopt that society's methods and perspectives.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
  
The study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate nonscientific cultures would most likely be considered objectionable to the proponents of the third version of multicultural education mentioned in the passage.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. The second version advocates adopting a neutral stance on cultural differences, but still uses Western scientific methods to study other cultures. Critics of this version of multicultural education argue that Western scientific methods are value-laden and that non-Western cultures cannot be adequately understood through Western perspectives and methods.
A: The passage does not indicate that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would object to a study of Western and non-Western moral codes.
B: The passage does not indicate that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would object to a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires.
C: The passage suggests that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would object to a study that employs Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture.

E: The passage does not indicate that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would object to a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The third paragraph states that the second version of multicultural education differs from the first in taking a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures. However, it is criticized by some as not essentially different from the first, as its methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western.
  
A: This choice describes a study that examines differences between Western and non-Western societies but it does not indicate that the study employs Western methods of examination, study, and explanation. Therefore, this choice is not discussing a method of education that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would most likely find objectionable.
  
B: This choice describes a study of one culture's literature to examine the types of characteristics that the culture admires. This does not necessarily involve the use of Western methods of examination, study, and explanation. Therefore, this choice is not discussing a method of education that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would most likely find objectionable.

C: This choice describes a study that investigates a nonscientific culture using Western scientific methods of examination, study, and explanation. Given that the third paragraph criticizes the use of Western scientific methods for the study of nonscientific cultures, proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would most likely find this type of study objectionable.
  
D: This choice describes a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of another society that has different values. Although this type of study could be seen as imposing Western values on a non-Western culture, it does not involve the methods of examination, study, and explanation that the third paragraph focuses on. Therefore, this choice is not discussing a method of education that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would most likely find objectionable.
  
E: This choice describes a study that criticizes the values of Western culture by using the methods of anthropology and sociology. This type of study does not involve using the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture to understand other cultures, which is what the first version of multicultural education does. Therefore, this choice is not discussing a method of education that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would most likely find objectionable.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
Third paragraph explains that proponents of second version of multicultural education believes that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The second version of multicultural education involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involve certain values such as objectivity, which is already identified with Western science. So, proponents of the second version of multicultural education are unlikely to be in favor of a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture. 
A: The passage does not discuss any objection to the study of differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies.
B: The passage does not discuss any objection to a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires.
C: The passage explains that critics of the second form of multicultural education argue that this form of education cannot adequately understand and appreciate non-Western cultures if they are examined solely through the lens of Western scientific perspectives and methods.
D: The passage does not discuss any objection to a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values.
E: The passage does not discuss any objection to a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The passage describes how prions are different from other pathogens.
  - The symptoms of CJD include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. 
  - CJD is inevitably fatal.
  - Prions reproduce themselves using an unexpected chain of transformation.
 
  A: The passage states that "Prions exhibiting abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque consisting of thread-like structures that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells." Therefore, the author would most likely agree with choice A.
  
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, which means that patients currently infected with CJD will not recover from the disease. Therefore, the author would least likely agree with choice B.
  
  C: The passage states that researchers discovered a disease agent causing CJD that was "lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein" and coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Therefore, the author would most likely agree with choice C.
  
  D: The passage states that "Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal." Therefore, the author would most likely agree with choice D.
  
  E: The passage states that "the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood." Therefore, the author would most likely agree with choice E.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) as a fatal degenerative form of dementia that causes extensive nerve cell death in the brain. 
  The cause of CJD is attributed to a protein pathogen called prions, which can reproduce and propagate in an unexpected way. 
  The author provides evidence to support the notion that prions are a new class of infectious pathogens and suggests that prions could be involved in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
  A: The passage discusses how certain abnormally shaped prions are responsible for CJD, a degenerative neurological disease. It can be inferred that the author would agree with this statement.
  B: The passage does not suggest that any patients infected with CJD will recover from the disease. It can be inferred that the author would not agree with this statement.
  C: The passage specifically describes how prions are capable of reproducing themselves without nucleic acid. It can be inferred that the author would agree with this statement.
  D: The passage indicates that the body does not produce an immune response when prions are present. It can be inferred that the author would agree with this statement.
  E: The passage acknowledges that current research has yet to fully understand the mechanisms by which prions reproduce and cause cellular destruction. It can be inferred that the author would agree with this statement. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the discovery of a new type of pathogen called prions responsible for the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. Prions lack nucleic acids and reproduce by causing existing normal proteins to transform into infectious prions. CJD is invariably fatal, and there is no effective therapy available.

Analysis:
  A: The passage describes how abnormally shaped prions can cause neurological disease in the form of CJD. Therefore, this statement is likely to be agreed with by the author.
  B: The passage clearly states that CJD is inevitably fatal. There is no mention of recovery from the disease. Therefore, this statement is not likely to be agreed with by the author.
  C: The passage describes how prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce by causing existing normal proteins to transform into infectious prions. Therefore, this statement is likely to be agreed with by the author.
  D: The passage states that prions, unlike other pathogens, do not cause an immune response when they are present in the body. This means that the body has no natural defense against them. Therefore, this statement is likely to be agreed with by the author.
  E: The passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. Therefore, this statement is likely to be agreed with by the author.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen that causes CJD. 
  A: The author supports the idea that the abnormal shape of prions leads to the destruction of nerve cells, which causes the symptoms of degenerative neurological conditions like CJD, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.
  B: The passage does not mention that any patients infected with CJD will recover from the disease. In fact, the passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal.
  C: The passage describes prions as a new class of infectious pathogens that lack nucleic acid but are able to reproduce and cause disease.
  D: The passage supports the idea that because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present, which means that the body has no natural defense against prion-related disease like CJD.
  E: The passage describes the discovery of prions and the current understanding of how they reproduce and cause cellular destruction. However, the passage also acknowledges that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of the pathogen responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) as a prion, a new type of protein pathogen. Prions exist naturally in the body as normal proteins that can transform into abnormal, pathogenic conformation leading to a cascade of transformations and destruction of nerve cells. There is no immune response when prions are present in the body, and CJD is inevitably fatal. 
  A: The passage supports this statement, stating that prions create abnormalities in brain tissue leading to nerve cell death. 
  B: The passage does not support this statement, stating that there are variations in incubation and progression times for CJD but not that recovery from the disease is possible. 
  C: The passage supports this statement, describing the discovery of a protein pathogen lacking nucleic acid as the cause of CJD. 
  D: The passage supports this statement, stating that the body does not produce an immune response to prions. 
  E: The passage supports this statement, stating that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The article explains how prions are a new type of protein pathogen that lacks nucleic acid, consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins. However, they have the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape, creating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact to the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, unlike other pathogens, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the characteristics of prions and their link to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  A: The passage describes how prions cause cellular destruction in the brain that ultimately leads to the nerve cell death associated with CJD. Thus, the author would agree with this statement.
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Thus, the author would not agree with this statement, as the passage contradicts it.
  C: The passage explains that prions have been found to be a novel type of protein pathogen that do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction. Thus, the author would agree with this statement.
  D: The passage states that prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. Thus, the author would agree with this statement.
  E: The passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. Thus, the author would agree with this statement.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which is a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  CJD is caused by a pathogen called a prion, which is an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.
  Prions are composed mainly, if not exclusively, of protein, and they lack nucleic acid.
  Prions possess the ability to reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present, and in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal.
  
A: The passage states that abnormal prions in brain tissue are a sign of neurological disease. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement. 
B: The passage does not suggest that any patients will recover from CJD. On the contrary, the passage states that the disease is inevitably fatal. 
C: The passage strongly agrees that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction. Therefore, the author is also likely to agree with this statement. 
D: The passage explains that the body does not produce an immune response against prions in the body since they occur naturally as proteins. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement. 
E: The passage states that scientists have yet to completely understand the mechanism by which prions reproduce themselves, which may imply a partial understanding. Therefore, the author is likely to agree with this statement. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of a new class of infectious pathogens called prions.
  These prions lack nucleic acid and consist mainly, if not exclusively, of protein, and they reproduce themselves by initiating a cascade process that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations ultimately destroys nerve cells, causing diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  The passage also notes that in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - The passage describes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans, that is caused by a pathogen called "prions".
  - Prions are different from other pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi...), in that they lack nucleic acid and consist mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  - The passage states that "in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal".
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage states that there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, and that CJD is inevitably fatal. Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would be least likely to agree with choice B, which states that "Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease."

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains the utility maximization principle which is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  A: A waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government as he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized. This is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as he is trying to maximize his overall satisfaction by lowering his taxes.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license. This is also a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as she is trying to avoid the cost of a speeding ticket and the loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. This is also a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as he is trying to minimize the cost of treating the pollutant while maximizing the profits from his business.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. This is also a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as she is trying to maximize her overall satisfaction by increasing her income to support herself and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as the worker is not trying to maximize his overall satisfaction rationally and deliberately.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle, which states that an individual will choose the action that results in the highest overall satisfaction or "expected utility" based on the potential outcomes and their likelihoods. The expected utility of illegal activity is compared to that of lawful activity and an individual will commit a crime if their expected utility from criminal activity, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.

A: The waiter avoids reporting all of his tips so that he can reduce his taxes
B: The motorist refrains from speeding because she would lose her driver's license
C: The industrialist continues to discharge an untreated pollutant because the cost of treatment is higher than the cost of the fine
D: The government official risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because of her inadequate salary
E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor because he believes that the dismissal was unfair.

Action: Answer("E") 
Option E is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as it is an impulsive crime of passion. The other options are examples of rational responses to economic incentives and disincentives, as they are all based on an individual's calculation of expected utility.
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage explains the utility maximization principle. This principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. According to the utility maximization principle, a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
A: The example describes a person concealing income in order to reduce taxes, which is a rational response to economic incentives that results in higher expected utility. 
B: The example describes a person avoiding speeding on a certain stretch of road due to the threat of losing their driver's license from a speeding ticket, which is a rational response to economic disincentives that results in lower expected utility.
C: The example describes an industrialist continuing to illegally discharge pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant, which is a rational response to economic incentives that results in higher expected utility.
D: The example describes a government official risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because she needs the money to support her family and her salary is inadequate, which is a rational response to economic incentives that results in higher expected utility.
E: The example describes a worker physically assaulting his former supervisor because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This is not an example of a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage introduces the economic principle of utility maximization, which analyzes an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  A, B, C, and D all involve rational economic choices that are made based on incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle, which suggests that people make rational economic choices based on the anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility, of each possible action.
  A: The waiter conceals his tip income to reduce his taxes, which is a rational response to economic incentives, even though it involves breaking the law.
  B: The motorist avoids speeding to avoid losing her driver's license, which is a rational response to economic disincentives.
  C: The industrialist continues to pollute illegally, which may suggest that the economic disincentives for polluting are not sufficient to outweigh the economic incentives for continuing to pollute.
  D: The government official risks prosecution for soliciting bribes due to economic pressures, which could make her decision a rational response to economic incentives, even though it involves breaking the law.
  E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor because he believes that he was treated unfairly, which is not necessarily a rational economic response to that situation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
   The passage explains the utility maximization principle according to which, the individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. A rational individual maximizes their overall satisfaction or expected utility when deciding to engage in an action.  
A: The waiter's decision to conceal a large part of his tip income from the government in order to reduce his taxes and believes that it is difficult for the government to detect and penalize his actions rationalizes for maximizing his overall satisfaction.
B: The motorist avoids speeding because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license. This rationalizes her decision to maximize her overall satisfaction.
C: The industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river rationalizes his decision to maximize overall satisfaction, as the cost of treatment, far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
D: The government official risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. Her decision rationalizes her response to maximize overall satisfaction.
E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor because he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair does not satisfy the requirement of the utility maximization principle as there is no expected utility or anticipated satisfaction from committing an assault. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. A person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
Action: Answer("E")  
Choice E, a worker physically assaulting his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair, would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as this action would not maximize the worker's satisfaction or utility.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage explains that the utility maximization principle shows that a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will choose to commit a deliberate crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.

A: The waiter is willing to conceal income, knowing that it is illegal, in order to reduce his taxes. This could be seen as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as he expects the utility of evading taxes to exceed the potential penalty for getting caught.
B: The motorist avoids speeding on a heavily patrolled stretch of road, knowing that if caught, she will lose her driver's license. This could be seen as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as she expects the utility of driving within the law to exceed the potential penalty for speeding.
C: The industrialist continues to pollute an untreated pollutant into a river because the fine for doing so is less than the cost of treatment. This could be seen as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as he expects the utility of avoiding treatment to exceed the potential penalty for getting caught.
D: The government official risks prosecution for soliciting bribes in order to support herself and her family, despite the risks of getting caught. This could be seen as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as she expects the utility of taking the risk to exceed the potential penalty for getting caught.
E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace. This action is described as impulsive rather than deliberate and would therefore be unlikely to be a response to economic incentives or disincentives.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  The analysis of an individual’s decision to commit a crime is viewed as a rational economic choice.
  The passage suggests that people respond rationally to economic incentives or disincentives.
  The passage demonstrates that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  
A: The waiter believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized, so his action is based on a rational evaluation of the risk of detection weighed against the utility of retaining more of his income, making this a rational response to economic incentives.
B: The motorist avoids speeding because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to the loss of her driver’s license, which results in a reduction of her expected utility from that action and is a rational response to economic disincentives.
C: The industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant, which results in the industrialist's action being based on a rational analysis of the relative costs and benefits of not treating the pollutant.
D: The government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. This action is based on a rational evaluation of the relative benefits and costs of soliciting bribes to make up the shortfall in her inadequate government salary.
E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This action is an impulsive reaction to the worker's feeling of unfair treatment and cannot be described as a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.
  D: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes three different styles in which Schoenberg's music evolved over time.
  The first style is characterized by late-Romantic manner and shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style is characterized by unstable harmonies and a lack of tonal basis.
  The third style is characterized by the 12-tone technique, which brought a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilized it.
  The author argues that Schoenberg's music is essential because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.

Action: Answer("A")  
The author implies that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one. The passage describes a clear evolution in Schoenberg's music, from the late-Romantic manner in the first style to the use of unstable harmonies in the second style and finally to the 12-tone technique in the third style. The author describes each style as a response to Schoenberg's artistic and intellectual convictions, with the 12-tone technique representing the next "inevitable step" in the historical development of music. The author's argument that Schoenberg's music is essential because it broke new ground in emotional expression also supports the idea that each style represents a natural progression towards that goal.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the three different musical styles that Schoenberg's music evolved through.
  The first style was the late-Romantic manner with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style involved unstable harmonies without tonal basis.
  The third style introduced the 12-tone technique to bring a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilize it.
  The author states that in all three styles, Schoenberg showed technical mastery and precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.

Action: Answer("A") 

The passage suggests that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one. The author notes that Schoenberg began in the late-Romantic manner which later progressed into unstable harmonies that no longer had a tonal basis. The 12-tone technique was introduced as a means of stabilizing nontonal music and bringing a new system of order. The author emphasizes that Schoenberg precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states in all three styles, highlighting that each style built on the previous one. Therefore, the most likely answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. 
  The first style is the late-Romantic manner, music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies. 
  Schoenberg pushed these harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. 
  He then developed the 12-tone technique as a means of stabilizing nontonal music. 
  In all three styles, Schoenberg operated with technical mastery and aimed to precisely delineate emotional states that music had not recorded before.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes three different styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style is late-Romantic music with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style involves pushing unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style involves the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music.
  Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery in all three styles.
  The real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The author would most likely agree with the statement that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one. The passage suggests that Schoenberg's development as a composer was an evolution of his previous style rather than a radical departure from it. The text says that Schoenberg pushed unstable harmonies in the second style and developed the 12-tone technique in the third, but these were done in part because in his view these were the next inevitable steps in the historical development of music. While the third style represents a departure from tonal music, which was the foundation of Western music for centuries, it is best characterized as a natural progression in Schoenberg's own artistic development.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses historical methods of art patronage and the interpretations of sociohistorical critics like Richard Taruskin. It distinguishes between two ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites" and highlights the differing tastes that have characterized such patrons. The passage also discusses the challenges of interpreting the messages conveyed by works of art that run counter to elite values. 

Eliminating choices:
  A: While this answer includes a historical perspective and references to class distinctions, it is overly simplistic and misses the subtleties of the argument the passage presents. 
  B: This answer is partially correct in that the passage is critical of the idea that elite classes merely reflect ideals, but it does not capture the whole point of the passage.
  C: This answer may be true in part, but it is not the main point of the passage.
  D: This answer is partially correct and highlights one of the main challenges of the sociohistorical interpretation, but it does not encompass the entire point of the passage.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the historical production of art by and for political and social elites, the reasons for this production, and the challenges of analyzing the relationship between elite patrons and the art produced for them.
  A: This is partially true, but it focuses heavily on the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures, which is not the main point of the passage.
  B: This is partially true, but it focuses heavily on the flaws of sociohistorical interpretations of art, which is not the main point of the passage.
  C: This is not accurate according to the passage, which notes that both the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie historically commissioned art for a variety of reasons, including to express their ideals and way of life.
  D: This is partially true, but it focuses heavily on the challenges faced by sociohistorical critics, which is not the main point of the passage.
  E: This is the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage. The passage discusses the two different ways that art historically was "produced by and for political and social elites" and the challenges of analyzing this relationship.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage discusses sociohistorical interpretations of art and how they traditionally view art as the production of a class imposing its ideals. The passage argues that while there are two different ways art was "produced by and for political and social elites", the sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze the second way, where the elites create a work that expresses their ideals and way of life. The art that went against the grain of elite values endured, even though the elites opposed it. Therefore, the sociohistorical critics can claim that in hidden ways, such art embodied the ideals of the elite who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by the work of which they overtly disapproved. Hence, the main point of the passage is that sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic (Option B).
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

The main point of the passage is to criticize the common sociohistorical interpretation of art, and to suggest that it is overly simplistic to claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes. The passage asserts that there are two different ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites," and argues that historians must analyze art in a more subtle way if they are to understand its social function. The passage does not discuss patrons of the arts primarily in terms of their motivations or interests, nor does it focus on the endurance of art commissioned by the elite.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

The main point of the passage is that sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic. The passage explains that there are two different ways in which art was produced for political and social elites and describes the limitations of analyzing art merely as a reflection of the ideals of the elite. The passage argues that artists sometimes subverted the ideals of their patrons, and that some art that went against these ideals has endured. As a result, the sociohistorical critic must engage in a more nuanced analysis of the relationship between elite ideals and works of art. Answer choice A is incorrect because it only focuses on art commissioned by elites, without discussing how sociohistorical critics view it. Answer choice "C" is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the motives of patrons or their ability to influence the development of the arts. Answer choice "D" is incorrect because it only describes the analytical method used by critics, without considering the limitations of their approach. Answer choice "E" is tempting because it accurately describes one of the main topics of the passage, but it is not broad enough to capture the central argument of the passage.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

The main point of the passage is that sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic. The author argues that there are two different ways that art historically was "produced by and for political and social elites" and that for this kind of analysis to work, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. The author argues that because of this, sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite. Thus, the best answer is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two different ways in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites".
  The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
  The more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example.
  Great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. 

Analysis:
  The passage discusses mainly the ways in which art was produced in different times in history and which classes produced them.
  The author has also talked about the taste of different classes and how some great art has emerged from these tastes.
  The main point is that sociohistorical interpretations of art produced by elites should consider the complexities of historical context and examine how artworks relate to the socio-cultural values of the time.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the two principal ways in which historic elite classes commissioned art, and how sociohistorical criticism can consider the second kind of art production as an expression of the ideals and worldviews of the elites. It also explains that some works of art that went against the grain of elite values were commissioned unwillingly and with misgivings. 

Action: Answer("B") 
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the different ways in which members of the elite had art produced for them historically. The author clarifies that there were two different ways, one being commissions of existing artists, and the other being the creation of works that express and mirror their ideals and way of life. Therefore, answer choice E most accurately expresses the main point of the passage.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage discusses how sociohistorical interpretations of art tend to view it as being produced by and for political and social elites, but questions the oversimplification of this analysis. The author explains that there are two different ways in which art was produced for elites historically, and that some artists may have subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Additionally, the taste of the aristocracy and upper middle class was not always conducive to producing art that endures. The main point is that sociohistorical interpretations of art that view it as simply embodying the ideals and values of elites are overly simplistic. Answer choice A is incorrect because the fact that art was primarily commissioned by governing and middle classes is not the main point. Choice C is incorrect because while the passage mentions that being a patron could be beneficial for reputation, it is not the main point. Choice D is incorrect because the author does not suggest that sociohistorical critics engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify their claims; rather, it is their tendency to seek out hidden meanings to justify their claims that is being discussed. Choice E is incorrect because while the author does discuss the two ways in which art was produced for elites, this is not the main point.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: The author refers. to the early days of biotechnology (line 38) primarily in order to
Choices:
  A: furnish a brief account of the evolution of academic biotechnology research
  B: establish that present competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented
  C: express nostalgia for a time when biotechnology research was untainted by commercial motives
  D: argue that biotechnology research is considerably more sophisticated today than it was in the past
  E: provide a historical justification for opposition to biotechnology patents

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author refers to the early days of biotechnology to explain that although there has been a shift from freely sharing research materials to a market model, the idea that patenting biotechnology will result in the patent holder controlling access to patented materials is likely to be false. The author believes that granting a patent does not imply granting the right to deny access and that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. The author further argues that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  
A: The author does not provide an account of the evolution of academic biotechnology research.
B: The author establishes that present competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented by referring to the early days of biotechnology; however, this is not the primary purpose of the reference to the early days.
C: The author does not express nostalgia for a time when biotechnology research was untainted by commercial motives.
D: The author does not use the reference to the early days of biotechnology to argue that biotechnology research is considerably more sophisticated today than it was in the past.
E: The correct choice. The author provides a historical justification for opposition to biotechnology patents by explaining that some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement and that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author refers to the early days of biotechnology to explain that some measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials created existed, even before the advent of patents in biotechnology. It provides an example that even before companies started to patent their discoveries they prevented others from gaining access to their developed materials.

A: The author does not provide an account of the evolution of biotechnology research.
B: This choice correctly identifies that the author uses the early days of biotechnology to establish that current competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented. 
C: The author shows no signs of favoring or expressing nostalgia in this article.
D: The author does not compare past and present sophistication levels of biotechnology research.
E: The author uses the historical example to argue that patenting materials doesn't imply denial of access.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about industries that use biotechnology and their interest in intellectual property protection that allows them to patent their discoveries. Academic institutions are increasingly sharing this view as their research funding is tied to it. However, some believe that patenting and commercializing biotechnology inventions may hinder basic research by restricting access to research materials, and the commercialization of biotechnology inventions by corporate patent holders may be harmful to the interests of academic researchers.

Action: Answer("B")  

The author refers to the early days of biotechnology primarily in order to establish that present competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented and in order to show that the history of biotechnology has instances where researchers have taken measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Thus, choice B is the best answer.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how intellectual property protection for biotechnology discoveries are viewed by industries and academic researchers. The perceived threat of restrictions on access to research materials by researchers is also discussed. The author discusses how researchers resisting biotechnology patents may confuse patent rights with control of access to biological materials.

  The author argues that scientists who resist patenting biotechnology are confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. 
Action: Answer("B") 
The author uses the reference to the "early days of biotechnology" primarily to establish that present competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented. The author explains that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created, and thus this is similar to the present competitive practices in biotechnology research where patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny.
Response 6:
Knowledge: The author uses the reference to the early days of biotechnology to contrast the early communal tradition of freely sharing research materials with today's market model of patenting and commercializing biotechnology inventions. It is stated that some early researchers also took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created.

Action: Answer("B")  
The correct answer is B because the author uses the reference to the early days of biotechnology to establish that present competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented and not to give a brief account of the evolution of academic biotechnology research, express nostalgia for a time when biotechnology research was untainted by commercial motives, argue that biotechnology research is considerably more sophisticated today than it was in the past, or provide a historical justification for opposition to biotechnology patents.
Response 7:
Knowledge:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10)
  C: "markedly inclusive" (line 16)
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24)
  E: "alien to the European style" (line 51)
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The passage describes earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that has been limited to written accounts recorded by non-Native American collaborators. This scholarship has overlooked traditional modes of personal history and pre-contact Native American cultures' diverse assumptions about self, life, and writing.

Analysis:
The question asks for the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies. The author's attitude can be inferred from phrases that are critical of or show limitations in the earlier scholarship.

Answer: Answer("A") "failed to address" (line 9) shows the author's negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship, because it suggests that the scholarship has overlooked an important aspect of Native American autobiographies. The other answer choices do not convey a negative attitude toward the earlier scholarship. "Highly diverse" (line 10), "markedly inclusive" (line 16), and "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24) describe aspects of pre-contact Native American cultures. "Alien to the European style" (line 51) describes a cultural difference, but does not express a clear attitude toward earlier scholarship.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that focused solely on written as-told-to life histories, while overlooking preliterate modes of communication, diversity of Native American cultures, and different concepts of self and expression. 
Action: Answer("A") 
The phrase "failed to address" (line 9) is used to highlight the author's criticism of earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies. Therefore, the best choice is A.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses how traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history have been overlooked by scholars who have focused on written documents that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators in the form of as-told-to life histories that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." 

A: "failed to address" refers to the scholarly oversight of not addressing the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography. This phrase does not suggest any attitude towards the earlier scholarship and their omission.

B: "highly diverse" describes Native American peoples and not the earlier scholarship, so this phrase does not suggest any attitude towards the earlier scholarship.

C: "markedly inclusive" describes the idea of self in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures and is not discussing the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies, so this phrase does not suggest any attitude towards the earlier scholarship.

D: "seemingly more fragmented" contrasts the traditional pre-literate modes of communicating personal history with the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. This phrase does not suggest any attitude towards the earlier scholarship.

E: "alien to the European style" is discussing the intercultural collaboration found in oral autobiography, which may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended. This phrase does not suggest any attitude towards the earlier scholarship. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies has focused on written documents created through a bicultural composite authorship approach. The author argues that this scholarship has overlooked traditional modes of communicating personal history and the cultural constructs of Native American peoples. The author's attitude toward this earlier scholarship is likely to be negative because they have these oversights and limitations. 
A: While this phrase suggests that the earlier scholarship was lacking in some way, it does not give a clear indication of the author's attitude toward it.
B: This phrase describes Native American peoples and is not directly related to the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
C: This phrase suggests that Native American cultures have a more inclusive idea of self, which is contrasted with the assumptions about self that underlie the concept of autobiography. This suggests that the author is critical of earlier scholarship for failing to take this into account.
D: This phrase suggests that the mode of autobiography used in some pre-contact Native American cultures is different from the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime, but it does not give a clear indication of the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
E: This phrase suggests that the intercultural collaboration involved in traditional Native American modes of autobiographical expression is different from the European style of autobiography. The use of the word "alien" suggests that the author is critical of earlier scholarship for failing to recognize this difference.
Action: Answer("E")

C: This choice accurately describes the cultural perspective of some pre-contact Native American cultures, but it does not convey the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
D: This choice accurately describes the relative differences between pre-contact Native American cultures and the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime, but it does not convey the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies. 
E: This choice accurately describes the author's position that the oral tradition of autobiography may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, but it does not convey the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage describes earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies, which the author argues is limited in scope and overlooks traditional, preliterate modes of communication. The author notes that earlier scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded and edited by non-Native American collaborator, ignoring the cultural constructs of Native American peoples, who have a different notion of selfhood, life, and writing than Europeans.    
A: "Failed to address" refers to the shortcomings of earlier scholarship, suggesting that the author disapproves of it.
B: "Highly diverse" describes the Native American peoples, not the earlier scholarship on their autobiographies.
C: "Markedly inclusive" describes the idea of self that characterizes pre-contact Native American cultures and is contrasted with the European assumption of selfhood that underlies the concept of an autobiography. The author does value this idea and discusses it in the passage, but it does not convey the author's attitude towards the earlier scholarship that the passage critiques.
D: "Seemingly more fragmented" compares the traditional oral modes of autobiographical expression used by Native Americans to the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. While the author gives a value-neutral description of the differences, there is no indication of the author's attitude toward either.
E: "Alien to the European style" refers to the intercultural collaboration that the author describes as part of the traditional modes of autobiographical expression used by Native Americans. While this is presented as different from the European style of autobiography, there is no indication of the author's attitude toward either.
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how scholars have overlooked traditional forms of autobiographical expression by early Native Americans and instead focused on written records obtained from collaborations with non-Native American individuals. The passage also emphasizes the cultural constructs of Native American peoples and their differing assumptions about the self, life, and writing as compared to European cultures.
 
Analysis: The question asks for the author's attitude towards earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies. There are a few phrases in the passage that describe the limitations of earlier scholarship such as "overlooked," "failed to address," and "seemingly more fragmented." However, the question is asking for the author's overall attitude towards these limitations, not just a description of them. The phrase that best conveys the author's attitude is "overlooked" because it suggests that the author believes that more attention should have been paid to other forms of autobiographical expression by early Native Americans.

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism
  D: admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture
  E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete

Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how Lichtenstein's work helped define pop art, while also conveying a seriousness of theme that allowed it to transcend mere parody. The passage notes that pop artists were rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, and Lichtenstein's work was part of that rebellion, while also displaying an impulse toward realism. The passage suggests that Lichtenstein's work evoked a nostalgia that gave it an inner sweetness, and that it demonstrated a faith in reconciliation.
  
  A: The author does express enthusiasm for Lichtenstein's work at times, and notes that it was part of a rebellion against abstract expressionism. However, the passage suggests that this is not the author's overall attitude toward Lichtenstein's work, as it discusses other aspects of the work as well.
  
  B: The passage does not focus on the youthfulness or innocence of Lichtenstein's work as particularly noteworthy or admirable, so it is unlikely that the author's attitude could be said to be one of respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence.
  
  C: The passage does describe Lichtenstein's work as part of a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, but it also notes that his work was not aloof in its attempt to ignore that earlier movement. Instead, the passage suggests that Lichtenstein's work was more complex, and attempted to incorporate realistic depictions of contemporary life with a deliberate naivete. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author's overall attitude toward the work could be characterized as one of pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism.
  
  D: The passage does not describe Lichtenstein's work as providing a subtle critique of contemporary culture, so this choice is unlikely to be the best answer.
  
  E: The passage describes various aspects of Lichtenstein's work that the author seems to appreciate, including its incorporation of realism and naivete, and its faith in reconciliation. The passage also suggests that Lichtenstein's work conveyed a seriousness of theme that transcended parody, and evoked a nostalgia that gave it an inner sweetness. Therefore, this choice is the most relevant and accurate choice.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. 
  A: This answer choice describes a scenario where certain businesses exert monopoly power even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions. This scenario does not undermine the author's argument that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power.
  B: This answer choice is focused on the salaries of workers as their tasks become narrower. This information is not relevant to the argument that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power.
  C: This answer choice describes a situation where businesses collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would. This situation supports the author's argument that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power.
  D: This answer choice describes the variability of the size a business must reach in order to achieve increasing returns to scale. While this is true, it does not undermine the author's argument that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power.
  E: This answer choice outlines a scenario where gains in productivity achieved by making workers more specialized are offset by other factors. This scenario is not relevant to the argument that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  
A: This does not weaken the connection because the author acknowledges that some larger businesses in some regions can exert monopoly power.
B: This does not weaken the connection because it does not relate directly to the connection.
C: This choice supports the author's argument, rather than opposing it.
D: This undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it shows that size is not the ultimate determinant of monopoly power. A smaller business could have monopoly power if it is in an industry with high barriers to entry.
E: This does not weaken the connection because the author is not arguing that making workers even more specialized will always lead to gains in productivity. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that there is a contradiction between the Pin Factory, which represents increasing returns to scale, and the Invisible Hand, which assumes diminishing returns to scale.
  The Pin Factory implies that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business and create a natural tendency toward monopoly power.
  The Invisible Hand assumes that there must be many competitors in each industry for the market to work properly.
  The economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns are notoriously hard to represent mathematically.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Option A discusses the presence of monopolies in some regions but does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. Option B argues that workers cannot command high salaries with narrowed tasks, but does not discuss size or monopoly power. Option D specifies that different industries reach different sizes to achieve increasing returns but does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. However, option C states that few players in an industry often collude to set prices, which directly reinforces the idea of monopoly power. It undermines the assumption that many competitors in a market prevent any exertion of monopoly power, which would weaken the author's argument against the idea of increasing returns in the Pin Factory.
Response 3:
Knowledge: In the given text, the passage explains that the Pin Factory concept is opposed to the invisible hand concept. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale but increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly. When an industry is dominated by just a few players, it is impossible to have many competitors in each industry, so the invisible hand cannot work properly.
A: This choice strengthens the argument of the passage as it adds that businesses can exert monopoly power despite the presence of larger businesses in other regions, indicating that potential competitors have been successfully driven out of business.
B, C and E: These choices are irrelevant to the mentioned connection.
D: This choice, if true, could weaken the argument that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, since it suggests that the size at which businesses achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely, implying that larger firms that enjoy increasing returns to scale might not drive smaller firms out of business. This would weaken the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that there is a tension between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand theory. On one hand, the Pin Factory shows that increasing returns to scale lead to natural tendencies toward monopoly because larger firms achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller firms, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. On the other hand, the Invisible Hand concept requires many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. 
  A: This statement discusses the fact that businesses can exert monopoly power in some regions, which would not undermine the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power that the author draws.
  B: This statement is discussing a result of increased specialization but does not directly undermine the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power.
  C: This statement shows that when few businesses dominate an industry, they can collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly. This reinforces the tension between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  D: This statement suggests that the size at which increasing returns start varies depending on the industry. This does not undermine the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power, but rather reinforces the idea that economies of scale are important.
  E: This statement discusses factors that offset gains in productivity of specialized workers. It does not directly undermine the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two concepts: (1) increasing returns to scale and (2) the invisible hand promoting competition to maintain market efficiency. 
  The paragraph suggests that the Pin Factory concept (increasing returns to scale) may lead to monopoly power, while the Invisible Hand concept requires a competitive marketplace to maintain market efficiency. 
  The author suggests that the mainstream economics has long followed the concept of diminishing returns to scale despite the existence of many firms that exhibited increasing returns to scale, such as the railroads. 
  The author suggests that the emergence of the concept of increasing returns to scale may have challenged the mainstream economic thought only in recent times.
  
A: This statement suggests that larger size does not necessarily translate to monopoly power in all regions because some large businesses may not be able to exert monopoly power. However, it does not question the underlying argument in the passage. Also, businesses that can exert monopoly power regionally do not impact the larger argument about increased size and monopoly power. 
B: This statement is a general statement about salaries and does not address the issue of monopoly power or the Invisible Hand concept. 
C: This statement is consistent with the argument in the passage that increasing returns would lead to monopoly power. Therefore, this choice does not undermine the argument. 
D: This statement possibly supports to the argument made in the passage that increasing returns to scale shows up in different industries at different times. This does not necessarily undermine the argument. 
E: This statement argues that there are limits to the advantages of increasing returns to scale, and the gains in productivity by making workers more specialized are offset by costs such as higher training costs. However, this does not question the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 

Action: Answer ("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes how the economics of increasing returns lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly when firms achieve larger scale and lower costs than their smaller competitors. The author argues that the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale diminish, not increase.
A: This statement describes a situation where larger businesses in the same industry in other regions are unable to exert monopoly power. It does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, or the assumption that returns to scale are increasing.
B: This statement is a description of the consequences of specialization on worker salaries, but it does not affect the connection between increased size and monopoly power, or the assumption that returns to scale are increasing.
C: This statement describes a situation where a few players in an industry collude to set prices, which would undermine the idea of free markets but does not affect the connection between increased size and monopoly power, or the assumption that returns to scale are increasing.
D: This statement suggests that the size of businesses that can achieve increasing returns varies by industry, which implies that some industries may not have the natural tendency towards monopoly that the author describes. This weakens the connection between returns to scale, increased size, and monopoly power.
E: This statement describes a situation where increased specialization could reduce gains in productivity, which would also weaken the connection between increased size and increasing returns to justify increasing monopolization.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The article explains that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly. Under this concept, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business until each industry is dominated by just a few players. The idea that free markets always work is dependent on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing. Diminishing returns mean that as the scale of production increases, the marginal product decreases. The Pin Factory is an excellent example of increasing returns, and the larger the pin factory gets, the more specialized its workers become, and the more pins the factory can produce per worker.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The article explains that the connection between increased size and monopoly power goes back to the fact that there are increasing returns to scale and that bigger firms tend to dominate smaller ones. If the size that a business must reach to begin achieving increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, then this would undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power and thus the assumption that free markets always work under diminishing returns. Therefore, (D) is the correct answer. Choices (A), (B), (C), and (E) do not address the underlying assumption of the effects of increasing returns to scale on monopolies, as they talk about other factors related to monopolies and production.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory. 
  Increasing returns to scale tend to create a natural tendency toward monopoly. 
  The invisible hand works properly when there are many competitors in each industry so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns are notoriously hard to represent mathematically.
  
A: This choice, if true, would not undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power. If anything, it would strengthen it.
B: This choice may be relevant to the discussion of the Pin Factory but it does not undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This choice, if true, would strengthen the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
D: If true, this would weaken the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power because it suggests that the relationship between size and monopoly power is not consistent across industries.
E: This choice, if true, would be relevant to the discussion of the Pin Factory but it does not undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that there is a contradiction inherent in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The Pin Factory is an example of how increased size can lead to greater efficiency and productivity, while the Invisible Hand relies on many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power. However, increasing returns to scale can lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly, since bigger firms can achieve larger scale and lower costs than smaller firms. The assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: Choice D would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, since it suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns varies widely from industry to industry. This would mean that not all industries face the same natural tendency toward monopoly as a result of increasing returns, and therefore the connection between size and monopoly power would not be as clear-cut. Choices A, B, C, and E are not relevant to the author's argument about increasing returns and monopoly power.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's position on the two opposing views of Russian literary criticism during his time. He takes a realist position but believes in a deeper understanding of reality that must include the fantastic. He disagrees with the radical critics' view that literature should primarily serve a political purpose. He believes that artistry is simply the ability to write well.
A: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky believed that reality was not independent of the experiences of individuals, going beyond the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is."
B: The passage does not state that Dostoyevsky believed that realism was unequal to the task of representing political views.
C: The passage states that the radical critics maintained that art should be useful but does not indicate that Dostoyevsky believed that art should be above the portrayal of reality.
D: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' insistence that art had to find its sources in concrete reality and have a political purpose. Instead, he believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
E: The passage describes Dostoyevsky as a realist who believed in a deeper understanding of reality that must include the fantastic and that reality was literature's crucial source.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's views on the role of reality and the fantastic in literature. He disagreed with the radical critics' view that literature must be useful to society and must portray reality as it is. He believed that reality and the fantastic are intertwined and that the author's talent lies in expressing his thoughts in characters and images. He believed that artistic merit is the most important aspect of a literary work.
  
A: This is correct based on the passage. Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  
B: The passage does not address the representation of political views in literature, nor does it suggest that Dostoyevsky believed that realism was unequal to this task.
  
C: The passage explicitly states that Dostoyevsky did not believe that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality. On the contrary, he believed that reality was the crucial source of successful literature.
  
D: This is a partial match to the passage, but not the most accurate answer. Dostoevsky did not deny the ability of realism to expose social inequities or contribute to creating a new society. However, he believed that reality was more than just the tangible experience, and he thought that the fantastic had an important place in literature. Also, he opposed the idea that a writer should be bound to a particular political view.
  
E: This is incorrect according to the passage. Although Dostoyevsky believed that the fantastic was intertwined with reality, he never said that reality was not the crucial source of successful literature. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was not what the radical critics wanted to depict; it was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  Dostoyevsky believed that the fantastic must be intimately bound up with reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that art should stand or fall on its artistic merit.

Action: Answer("D") 

Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society, as the radical critics believed. Rather, he believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and he advocated for the incorporation of the fantastic into literature as a means of exploring the boundaries of reality. Dostoevsky also believed that art should stand or fall on its artistic merit, rather than being judged based on whether it serves a particular political view.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time: one that maintained that art stood high above everyday reality, and another that maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society. Dostoyevsky took a third position and believed that reality was literature's crucial source and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.

Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society, and their insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
Response 4:
Knowledge:
Dostoevsky was a realist who believed that reality was literature's crucial source; however, he believed reality was far more than the merely tangible and there is no distinction between fantasy and reality. He did not agree with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because they believed that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society, and because they insisted that art must serve a particular political view.

Action: Answer("D") 
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage presents Dostoyevsky's position on reality and literature.
  A: Dostoyevsky believed that one's experiences affect the way reality is perceived. This is mentioned in the passage: "Reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it."
  B: The passage does not mention that Dostoyevsky thought realism is unequal to the task of representing political views. In fact, he believed that the demand for art to serve a political view was a contradiction in terms.
  C: The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky thought art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality. In fact, he was a realist who believed that reality was the crucial source of literature.
  D: Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view that realism facilitates the exposure of social inequities or contributes to the creation of a new society. He believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world, and that reality was far more than the merely tangible. He also believed that assigning art to serve a political view was "a shameful destiny" for art. Therefore, he would not agree with this statement.
  E: The passage mentions that as a realist, Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. Therefore, he would not agree with this statement.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage talks about Dostoyevsky's perspective on literary realism and how he disagrees with the radical critics' view that art must serve a particular political view and be useful. Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work should stand and fall on its artistic merit. For him, the task of the writer was to go beyond reality, and he saw no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. 

Action: Answer("D") 
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses several different literary positions, with a particular focus on Dostoyevsky's views. 
  A: According to the passage, for Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and "reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it", which suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was not independent of the experiences of individuals.
  B: While the passage discusses the radical critics' demand that literature serve a particular political view, it does not suggest that Dostoyevsky believed realism was unequal to the task of representing political views.
  C: The radical critics believed that literature should have a concrete reality and a practical utility, while Dostoevsky believed that reality was important but also that literature could "explode the boundaries of the so-called real world." It is therefore unlikely that Dostoevsky believed that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality.
  D: The passage notes that the radical critics believed that art should expose social inequities and contribute to the creation of a new society, but according to the passage, Dostoyevsky believed that the radical critics' view of realism was "meaningless" and that the formal aspects of a work were important. However, the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky believed that realism is ineffective at exposing social inequities or contributing to social change.
  E: The passage does not suggest that reality is not the crucial source of successful literature. Rather, the passage suggests that Dostoyevsky viewed reality in a more complex way than the radical critics did, and that his understanding of reality went beyond the merely tangible. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage is about Dostoyevsky’s views on literature and art during his time.
  A: Dostoyevsky believed that reality is shaped by the person who experienced it, and there is no distinction between fantasy and reality. Thus, it can be inferred that Dostoevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
  B: The passage does not discuss the relationship between realism and representing political views.
  C: Dostoyevsky took a realist position and never doubted that reality, including the reality of life's absurdities, was literature's crucial source. However, he did not believe that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  D: According to the passage, Dostoevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, which means that he did not entirely disagree with the objective of realism, such as the exposure of social inequities or contributing to the creation of a new society. But Dostoevsky thought that the radical critics’ demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless, since reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it. Thus, this choice is incorrect.
  E: The passage states that Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the literary criticism debate in Russia during Dostoyevsky's time and Dostoyevsky's position as a realist who went beyond the reality presented by the radical critics. For Dostoyevsky, reality was shaped by the individual who experienced it, and there was no clear distinction between fantasy and reality. He believed that a literary work had to stand on its artistic merit alone and rejected the utilitarian idea that literature must serve a particular political view or be useful to society.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the political activism of Mexican Americans in the United States in the period between 1930 and 1960. 
  The passage discusses the potential limitations of the study of this historical period undertaken by Mario Garcia. 
  The passage discusses the political diversity of Mexican American activists during this period and notes that there were significant differences among organizations engaged in political activism.

Analysis:
  The passage argues that there are potential limitations to the study of the political activism engaged in by Mexican Americans during the period between 1930 and 1960. Specifically, it argues that analyses of this period may place too much emphasis on the views and activities of political activists and may not account for variations in the broader population of Mexican Americans. While the passage notes that there were significant differences among organizations involved in political activism, it also suggests that it is difficult to know the extent to which the views of these organizations were representative of the broader population of Mexican Americans. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the development of Mexican American political activism between 1930 and 1960 and the extent to which this activism was representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period.

  The passage also suggests that the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States may have contributed to an increase in political activism among this population.

Analysis: 
  While the passage suggests that the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States may have contributed to an increase in political activism among this population, it also notes that without a better understanding of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism. 
  The passage also suggests that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the development of Mexican American political activism in the United States between the 1930s and the 1960s. The author argues that the political diversity among Mexican American activists during this period was greater than traditionally recognized, and suggests that some of the assumptions underlying recent scholarship on this topic may be flawed. In particular, the author suggests that the relationship between ethnic consciousness and specific demographic factors, such as rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization and the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States, is complex and not fully understood. 

Analysis: The passage presents a nuanced and somewhat ambiguous position on the relationship between ethnic consciousness and specific demographic factors among Mexican Americans during the period under consideration. The author makes clear that multiple factors likely played a role in shaping the views and political activity of this group, and suggests that simplistic assumptions about these relationships may be misguided. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the degree to which the views of political activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States between 1930 and 1960.
  Garcia argues that a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared from 1930 to 1960, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists.
  Important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, need to be considered. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Mexican American Generation, a group of political activists in the United States between 1930 and I960, and their political diversity and radicalism. The author argues that there was not a consensus among these activists and that their views might not have been representative of the entire Mexican American population.
  
  The passage argues that it is not clear how far the activist's outlook extended beyond them. Therefore, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism. 

  None of the options directly states what the passage supports about ethnic consciousness. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the political activism of the "Mexican American Generation" in the United States between 1930 and I960. The passage states that Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor.
  
A: The passage does not support the claim that ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
B: The passage suggests that a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared and were more politically active than their predecessor. However, the passage does not explicitly support that an increase in the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States led to an increase in ethnic consciousness.
C: The passage does not support the claim that ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
D: The passage supports the claim that variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
E: The passage supports the claim that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the degree to which the views of Mexican American political activists in the mid-twentieth century were representative of the larger Mexican American population, and argues that a better understanding of important variables such as patterns of immigration and naturalization is needed to determine this.

A: The passage does not state that ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
B: The passage suggests that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States may have resulted in an increase in political activism on the part of a new generation of Mexican American leaders, but it does not state that this necessarily led to an increase in ethnic consciousness.
C: The passage does not state that ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
D: The passage suggests that the influence of Mexican American leaders over the population at large may account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness, but it does not state that this is the only or primary factor.
E: **Answer: E** The passage explicitly argues that a better understanding of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization is needed to determine the extent to which the views and activism of the Mexican American Generation were representative of the ethnic Mexican population as a whole, suggesting that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization may account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the Mexican American Generation and its political diversity, and it mentions Garcia's argument that a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared between 1930 and 1960, who were more acculturated and politically active than the previous generation. The passage also suggests that the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period is unclear and cannot be assumed without a better understanding of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create.

Analysis: The passage does not provide support for answer choice A or C, as it does not discuss the relationship between rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization or assimilation and ethnic consciousness. Answer choice B is mentioned in the passage as a variable that influenced the appearance of a new generation of Mexican American leaders, but it does not address the question of ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans. Similarly, answer choice D is mentioned as a factor that may account for variations in ethnic consciousness, but it does not provide support for the statement that ethnic consciousness increases or decreases. Therefore, the best answer is E, which is mentioned in the passage as an important variable that needs to be understood in order to determine the relationship between the Mexican American Generation's views and the ethnic Mexican population's political activism. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the Mexican American Generation, a group of political activists in the United States between 1930 and I960.
  The passage notes that there were differences among these activists regarding their political views.
  The passage also notes that the Mexican American Generation was more politically engaged and diverse than earlier historians had recognized.
  The passage suggests that increased rates of immigration and naturalization, as well as the experience of discrimination and inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, may have influenced the creation of a new generation of Mexican American leaders who were more acculturated and politically engaged than their predecessors.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the origins and political diversity of the "Mexican American Generation" and its representation of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during the 1930s and 1940s. The passage also notes that there were fierce controversies during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance.

Analysis: 
The passage suggests that ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans is not a straightforward issue and can be affected by various factors, including patterns of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create. Garcia argues that a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared after 1930, but it is not clear how far their outlook extended beyond these activists.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of dance-isolation to North American and European choreography and her success in bringing traditional dance techniques from certain cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance.
  Dunham's training in anthropological research and choreography, as well as her approach to research, were critical to her success.
  Some colleagues in anthropology advised her not to participate in the dances she was observing due to the physical demands of the dances and the belief in complete detachment when conducting research.
  
Action: Answer("C") 
The passage suggests that the author would agree that Dunham's colleagues were incorrect in advising her to increase the degree of her detachment since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor. The author indicates that Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time, and her prolonged immersion in observing and participating in dances allowed her to comprehend the dances as complex cultural practices and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Therefore, the passage implies that extensive personal investment in fieldwork, rather than complete detachment, was critical to Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques from certain cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances which she was observing.
  They subscribed to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Dunham participated in the dances herself and through prolonged immersion, she was able to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The passage suggests that the colleagues in anthropology were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment since they subscribed to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. However, Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time, proving that extensive personal investment in fieldwork enhances scientific rigor. Therefore, answer C is the correct answer.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  They advised her of this partly because of the extreme physical demands of the dances and partly because they subscribed to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  The passage suggests that Dunham's approach diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  Dunham's approach helped her to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices and learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others.
  Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance.
  The ballets she created in this way were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance.
  Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The colleagues of Katherine Dunham advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing due to the extreme physical demands of the dances and because they subscribed to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can only be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  The passage suggests that Dunham's success in bringing traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.

The passage also describes Dunham's methodology for research and the advice she received from her colleagues in anthropology.
  A: The passage does not suggest that injury during fieldwork compromised Dunham's research. This choice is incorrect.
  B: The passage mentions that Dunham generally eschewed caution and participated in the dances she was studying, suggesting that she did not initially exercise caution. However, there is no mention that her skill in performing the dances improved with experience. This choice is incorrect.
  C: The passage suggests that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her to remain detached from the dances she was studying, but that she was successful in combining study with personal participation and investment. The passage does not suggest that increasing detachment enhances scientific rigor. This choice is incorrect.
  D: The passage mentions that social scientists in the past gravitated towards areas that were recognized as scientifically rigorous, and that Dunham's colleagues subscribed to the view that effective data gathering should be conducted from a position of complete detachment. The passage suggests that this view is no longer considered realistic. This choice is the most likely answer.
  E: The passage does not discuss whether dance can be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology. This choice is incorrect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Katherine Dunham's approach to research involved participation in the dances she was observing, despite the advice of her colleagues in anthropology.
  Her colleagues believed that effective data gathering requires complete detachment.
  The passage suggests that their views on detachment in anthropology are now recognized as unrealistic.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The author describes how Katherine Dunham succeeded in bringing dance-isolation and traditional dance techniques into modern North American dance.
  The author also notes that anthropological research on dance was neglected prior to Dunham's work.
  Colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not get too involved in dances she was observing, and to remain detached to effectively conduct data gathering.
  Because of Dunham's interest and skill, she generally eschewed this caution and participated in the dances herself. 
Action: Answer("C")  
The passage notes that Dunham's colleagues advised her to maintain a position of complete detachment while conducting data gathering. However, Dunham's immersion in the dances allowed her to comprehend the dances as complex cultural practices and to incorporate their techniques into new forms of ballet. The author does not suggest that Dunham's colleagues were correct in recommending a higher degree of detachment. Thus, the correct answer is (C): "They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor."
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The colleagues in anthropology advised Katherine Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing. Colleagues in anthropology subscribe to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

The passage notes that Katherine Dunham's colleagues gave her advice to maintain detachment while conducting research into dance forms. However, the passage goes on to suggest that Dunham's personal involvement in the dances - a departure from her colleagues' advice - allowed her to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, and, as a result, learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. In other words, Dunham's success in this area arose precisely from a more intense degree of personal involvement than her colleagues had recommended. Therefore the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that they were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the colleagues' advice to Dunham about her anthropological research in dance.
  The colleagues advised Dunham to avoid participating in the dances she was observing.
  Dunham generally disregarded this advice and participated in the dances herself.
  The passage does not provide enough information to determine whether the colleagues were correct or incorrect in their advice.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the advantages of digital publishing and how it drastically reduces certain costs associated with traditional publishing. The author mentions that the elimination of certain costs would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing.
  
  A: The passage does not mention literal agents' fees as a category of expense that is eliminated in digital publishing. 
  B: The passage mentions that costs of printing, selling, and distributing physical books are irrelevant to digital publication, which means that the cost of having books printed and bound is eliminated under digital publishing. 
  C: The passage mentions that the elimination of certain costs means that authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. This refers to royalty payments made to authors, so this cannot be considered as a category of expense being eliminated. 
  D: The passage mentions warehousing and shipping costs, and the cost of displaying physical books in retail stores as costs that are eliminated in digital publishing. These can be viewed as costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books. Hence, this can possibly be categorised as a whole category of expense being eliminated under digital publishing. 
  E: The passage does not mention the total sales of a book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller as a category of expense that is eliminated in digital publishing. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The author states that the elimination of whole categories of expense means that authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product.
A: The fees collected by literal agents from their clients are not mentioned as the "whole categories of expense" being referred to.
B: The author mentions that the costs of printing and selling physical books are irrelevant to digital publication so this could refer to the "whole categories of expense".
C: The royalties paid to authors are not referred to as "whole categories of expense".
D: The cost specific to the retail trade of traditional printed books might be a "whole category of expense" but the author does not mention this directly.
E: The value of returned unsold books is not referred to as "whole categories of expense."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the economic efficiency and convenience of digital publishing, which eliminates various costs associated with traditional publishing. It suggests that because of this, literaI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could aslc for larger share of the proceeds for their authors. 
A: The fees collected by literary agents from their clients are not specifically referred to as "whole categories of expense."
B: The price paid to have books printed and bound is a category of expense, but not the primary one referred to here.
C: The royalties paid to authors are not categories of expense, but rather the value of the final product.
D: The costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books might be considered a category of expense, but it is not the primary one referred to here.
E: The total sales of a book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller is also not the primary category of expense referred to here. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The paragraph discusses the differences in expenses between traditional publishing and digital publishing. 
  A: Literary agents are mentioned as being entitled to a larger share of the proceeds due to a greater proportion of the value of the final product. They are not the subject of the "whole categories of expense" referred to in the phrase.
  B: The phrase refers to categories of expense that are no longer relevant in digital publishing. The cost of printing and binding books would certainly be one of these categories.
  C: The costs paid to authors by their publishers are not the subject of the phrase. However, the idea of authors being entitled to a larger share of the proceeds is discussed in the sentence leading up to the phrase.
  D: This answer choice could potentially be a category of expense that is addressed in the phrase, but it is not as all-encompassing as the phrasing suggests.
  E: This answer choice is not an expense category. It refers to the formula for calculating sales profits after addressing the cost of unsold books, which is not discussed in the paragraph.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes the shift towards digital publishing and the benefits it offers, such as eliminating costs associated with the printing, shipping, and selling of physical books.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the context, "whole categories of expense" refers to costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books, such as warehousing, shipping, displaying, and returning unsold books, which are no longer relevant to digital publication. Therefore, the best answer is D.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage argues that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines, which would eliminate the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. 
  A: The passage does not mention any fees charged by literary agents.
  B: The phrase "whole categories of expense" is not referring to the price paid to have books printed and bound, but rather to the costs that are eliminated under the digital publishing model.
  C: The passage suggests that the digital publishing model would result in authors being entitled to a larger share of the proceeds, since the costs of printing, selling, and distributing physical books would be eliminated. However, the phrase "whole categories of expense" is not referring to royalties paid by publishers to authors.
  D: The phrase "whole categories of expense" is referring to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books, such as warehousing, shipping, displaying, and returning unsold books to publishers.
  E: The phrase "whole categories of expense" is not referring to the total sales of a book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the economic advantages of digital book publishing compared to traditional publishing. It mentions that one advantage of digital publishing is eliminating certain costs associated with traditional publishing, such as warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Choice D is the closest answer to the author's meaning. The author is discussing costs associated with the retail trade in traditional printed books, such as the display of books in physical stores. While the other options involve costs related to publishing, they do not refer specifically to the costs that the author is discussing in this part of the passage.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the cost savings of digital publishing over traditional publishing, where there is no physical inventory and no costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying, and returning physical books. Therefore, "whole categories of expense" likely refers to costs related to traditional publishing that are not incurred in digital publishing.
  A: The fees collected by literary agents is not a cost of publishing.
  B: Printing and binding is a cost of traditional publishing but not a "whole category of expense."
  C: Royalties paid to authors by their publishers is a cost of publishing.
  D: Costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books is a possible interpretation, but it is not comprehensive enough to reflect the author's use of "whole categories of expense."
  E: The total sales of a book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller is a calculation relating to the net revenue of a book from a publisher's perspective and is not a category of expense.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses how digital publication will eliminate costs associated with warehousing, shipping books, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers (lines 16-19). 
  A: The author does not discuss fees collected by literary agents in the context of "whole categories of expense."
  B: The author specifically mentions that the cost of printing and binding is one of the categories of expense that will be eliminated by digital publication (lines 10-15).
  C: The author mentions that under the digital publishing model, authors will be responsible for a greater proportion of the final product's value and therefore entitled to a larger share of the proceeds (lines 22-27).
  D: The author discusses some of the costs associated with retail trade that will be eliminated by digital publication, such as displaying physical books in retail stores (lines 16-19), but does not use the phrase "whole categories of expense" to refer specifically to this.
  E: The concept of sales minus the value of returns is not related to the discussion of "whole categories of expense" that will be eliminated by digital publication. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing will be less expensive than traditional publishing because the costs of physical inventory will be eliminated.
  A: This choice is not related to the "categories of expense" mentioned by the author.
  B: This is the most likely answer, as the phrase "whole categories of expense" seems to refer to the costs of printing and binding physical books.
  C: While the elimination of printing and binding costs may allow publishers to pay authors higher royalties, this is not what the phrase "whole categories of expense" specifically refers to.
  D: The costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books are not discussed in relation to the phrase "whole categories of expense".

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification poses several problems: it is unknown how often it is used or for what purposes, juries often lack sufficient evidence or, more generally, the ability to make a reasoned decision, and juries are not legislators and are unelected, unaccountable, and lack any obligation to consider the effect their acquittal might have on others.
  Passage B argues that the jury serves as a safety valve for overzealous police and prosecutors and can assist the legislature more broadly by nullifying laws that it deems unjust or inappropriately applied.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses jury nullification in criminal cases.
  Passage B argues that juries can act as a "safety valve" in the legal system and have the power to nullify laws they believe are unjust or should not be applied to a particular defendant.
  Both passages acknowledge that there are potential problems with jury nullification, including the lack of accountability, insufficient evidence, and the potential for abuse.
Option A is not mentioned in either of the passages. 
Option B is discussed in both passages and they both seem to agree on this point. 
Option C is not directly compared in either of the passages. However, Passages A and B suggest that both jurors and elected officials can be biased at times. 
Option D is in direct contrast to Passage A, which argues that jurors are not legislators and should not have the power to interpret or create laws. Passage B does suggest that juries can interpret laws to decide whether they should or shouldn't apply to a defendant, but that is still different from the notion of juries having the power to interpret laws in general like a legislature. 
Option E is only discussed in Passage B, which suggests that juries can act as a "safety valve" in the legal system when police and prosecutors are overzealous in pursuing violations of the law. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage A, the author believes that the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great, and argues that the jury is not suited to make decisions to modify criminal laws besides applying them.
  In Passage B, the author believes that the jury has an important role in correcting the possible excesses of police and prosecutors, and that it can influence legislators by showcasing potential problems with laws.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Passage A argues against the power of jury nullification and suggests that juries should not have discretion to interpret laws.
  - Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful tool in certain situations, such as when the law is unjust or when officials are overzealous.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A highlights problems created by jury nullification and argues against it.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be used to function as a safety valve in the legal system and assist the legislature in indicating potential issues with laws. 

Analysis: 
  Both passages appear to agree on the importance of the legislature creating laws. 
  While Passage A argues against jury nullification, Passage B provides arguments in favor of it as a safety valve and a helpful tool in indicating potential problems with laws. 

Action: Answer("D") - The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The authors of the passages both offer their perspectives on the subject matter of jury nullification.
  Passage A is critical of jury nullification because it is difficult to know how the power is used and juries often lack evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. It argues that juries are not legislators and that disagreement over criminal laws belongs in public debate, where revisions to the law can be scrutinized and debated.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful, such as in cases where a law is unjust or when a case is too trivial or extenuated for a conviction. It suggests the nullification can convey information to the legislature. The passage acknowledges that the power of nullification can be abused, but it downplays the significance of such instances of nullification.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The authors agree that jury nullification can be problematic. However, Passage B suggests that jury nullification can sometimes be a useful safety valve.
  A: Both authors mention that juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts. However, they do not explicitly disagree on whether or not juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts.
  B: Both authors suggest that reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. However, they do not explicitly disagree on whether or not laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
  C: While Passage A suggests that jurors are not legislators and are not accountable, Passage B highlights that police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Therefore, they might disagree over whether or not it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are.
  D: Passage A suggests that the jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. However, Passage B suggests that when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question. Therefore, the authors might disagree over whether or not it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  E: Passage A does not mention police and prosecutors. However, Passage B suggests that police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Therefore, the authors might agree on this point.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification, and argues that the jury is not the appropriate entity to decide the proper reach of criminal laws. 
  - Passage B argues that jury nullification can be helpful in certain circumstances, such as when a law is unjust or when the case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating. The author suggests that when the jury nullifies in these cases, it is assisting the legislature by indicating that there may be a problem with the law in question.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification: we do not know how often nullification occurs, jurors often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, and juries are not legislators.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful in cases where police and prosecutors are overzealous, or when the law is flawed or unjust. It also argues that nullification is uncommon.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that the power of jury nullification can create problems because juries may use this power for evil ends, may have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, and because jurors are not elected officials with accountability, jurisdiction or obligation to properly revise criminal laws.
  Passage B argues that the power of jury nullification can be useful to safeguard against overzealous officials and unjust laws.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration
  D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  E: Some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the debate surrounding biotechnology patenting and its impact on access to research materials. 
  A: The passage does not provide any information to support or refute this statement. 
  B: The passage acknowledges concerns that patent holders or owners of biological materials may charge high fees or require costly agreements, but it does not state that excessive fees are typical. 
  C: The passage suggests that patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and that judges typically respect a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement, which could limit patent holders' ability to prevent researchers from using patented materials. 
  D: The passage states that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions are increasingly in favor of intellectual property protection, in part because of their reliance on research funding that is conditional on patentability. There is no suggestion in the passage that academic researchers rely too heavily on such funding. 
  E: The passage suggests that scientists who oppose biotechnology patents may mistakenly conflate patents with control over access to biological materials, and that patents may in fact spur innovation among researchers. The passage does not suggest that scientists who oppose biotechnology patents do so because their work is not innovative enough to qualify for protection. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses how biotechnology researchers and industries advocate for intellectual property protection for their discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential, but also notes concerns raised about how patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions may hinder basic research, particularly by restricting access to research materials like genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals.
A: The article states that in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created, and that researchers who oppose patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. The idea that scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions is not discussed, and there is evidence in the article that some researchers had concerns about competitors gaining access to materials they had created even before patenting became a common practice.
B: The article discusses concerns that patent holders may charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials, but also suggests that it is unclear whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher conducting basic and noncommercial research, and that there has been a tradition of respecting a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
C: The article suggests that the cost of patent litigation may be an effective check on patent holders who might try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials, as initiating a patent lawsuit is expensive and usually only done to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
D: The article notes that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly advocate for intellectual property protection for their results because of their reliance on research funding that is in part contingent on the patentability of their results, but also suggests that concerns have been raised about how patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions may hinder basic research, particularly by restricting access to research materials like genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals.
E: The article does not suggest that scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection. Rather, it suggests that some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in restrictions on access to those materials that hinder basic research, and that these researchers may be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials.

While some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in restrict access to research materials, others believe that patents provide scientists with incentive to innovate.

A: This statement is partially true but does not best reflect the author's position. The passage states that in the early days of biotechnology, researchers both freely shared research materials and took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to those materials.
B: This statement is the opposite of the author's position. The author does not argue that corporate patent holders typically charge unreasonable fees.
C: This statement is consistent with the author's position. The author argues that patent litigation is expensive and that judges have historically respected a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
D: This statement is partially consistent with the author's position. The author discusses how biotechnology researchers rely on research funding that is partially tied to the patentability of their discoveries.
E: This statement is inconsistent with the author's position. The author argues that patents provide scientists with incentive to innovate.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the perceived threats to basic research arising from the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions and the restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals, resulting from patenting or contractual agreements. The author argues against some of the concerns, suggesting that enforcing patent rights against a researcher engaged in noncommercial research is questionable, and that patents provide scientists with incentives to innovate. 
  A: The author does not address the reasons why scientists in the early days of biotechnology research freely shared research materials.
  B: The author does not suggest that corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for conducting research involving their patented materials.
  C: The author argues that patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee, but does suggest that it is an effective check on patent holders.
  D: The author suggests that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share the view that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential because of their reliance on research funding that is in part contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: The author does not suggest that scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the benefits and drawbacks of patenting biotechnology inventions, particularly with regard to access to research materials used in basic research. 
  A: The author does not make a statement about why researchers shared materials in the early days of biotechnology research.
  B: The author discusses the fear that patent holders may charge high fees for using patented materials but does not suggest that such fees are typical or excessive.
  C: The author suggests that the high cost of patent litigation is a check on patent holders who might try to prevent basic research but does not suggest that this is an "effective" check.
  D: The author notes that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly support patenting due to reliance on funding that is partially contingent on patentability.
  E: The author does not suggest that resistance to biotechnology patents is linked to insufficient innovation of the researchers.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The author believes that questions have been raised regarding the impact of biotechnology patents on basic research, and that some researchers fear that patent holders may restrict access to research materials or charge high fees for their use. The author argues that patent rights do not necessarily equate to control of access and states that patent litigation is typically expensive and initiated to protect a market position.

Action: Answer("C") - The author argues that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the controversy surrounding the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions, particularly in relation to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals, and the perceived threat to basic research. The author argues that academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents are confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials, and that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. The author also suggests that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  
A: The author does discuss the early days of biotechnology research, but does not suggest that materials were shared because of a lack of intellectual property protection.
B: The author does not suggest that corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials. Rather, the author notes concerns about the potential for patent holders to charge prohibitively high fees for access to materials.
C: The author suggests that the cost of patent litigation is not typically a check on patent holders who might try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials, but rather notes that patent litigation is an expensive endeavor that is usually initiated to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
D: The author notes that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly support intellectual property protection for their results because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. There is no suggestion that the author believes that researchers rely too heavily on such funding.
E: The author suggests that opposition to biotechnology patents arises from concerns about control of access to biological materials, not from a lack of innovation on the part of the researchers involved.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation and that the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone also chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. Based on this information, testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, showed that manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  Chlorine destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms, which results in each chlorine atom being able to destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  The depletion of the ozone layer can continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  The passage discusses that the production of ozone-depleting gases was banned in the Montreal Protocol of 1987.

Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: 
  The most useful experiment would be to test whether a new chemical breaks down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, which is how CFCs contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer. This would indicate whether the chemical has the potential to harm the ozone layer in the way that CFCs did. Therefore, the correct answer is option E.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable.
  Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland showed that the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. 
  In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

Analysis:
  The question asks for information that would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Choice A is not relevant to the question at hand.
  Choice B asks about how the chemical would interact with other chemicals in the lower atmosphere, but this is not relevant to the question at hand.
  Choice C is relevant because the chemical might react with chlorine, and it was shown that chlorine leads to the destruction of the ozone layer.
  Choice D is not relevant because it asks for chemical properties that the chemical shares with chlorine, not whether it would affect the ozone layer.
  Choice E is relevant because it examines how the chemical reacts to ultraviolet radiation, which was shown to be a factor in the depletion of the ozone layer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) damage the ozone in the stratosphere and how Molina and Rowland were instrumental in advocating for policies to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  A: There is no mention in the passage about testing the chemical's reaction with forms of oxygen other than ozone. 
  B: While the passage discusses how CFCs react with other chemicals in the atmosphere as they diffuse upward into the stratosphere, this information is not helpful for determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damage to the ozone layer.
  C: The passage discusses how CFCs, when they diffuse into the stratosphere, are broken down and release chlorine, which leads to the destruction of the ozone layer. Testing a chemical to see if it would chemically react with chlorine would therefore be useful information in determining whether it could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  D: The passage does not discuss the chemical properties that CFCs or their constituent elements share with chlorine, so this information is not helpful in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damage to the ozone layer.
  E: The passage discusses how CFCs, when subjected to ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere, break down into their constituent elements, which include chlorine, and how this process leads to the destruction of the ozone layer. Testing a chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, therefore, would be useful information in determining whether it could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses that CFCs can chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, and that the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. As a response to this, an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) was established to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
A: This experiment only tests whether a chemical could react with other forms of oxygen. It does not directly test if the chemical would damage the ozone layer.
  B: This experiment only tests the chemical reactivity of a chemical with other chemicals found in the lower atmosphere. It does not directly test if the chemical would damage the ozone layer in the stratosphere.
  C: This experiment tests whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine. Chlorine is a key chemical that, when it accumulates in the stratosphere, is capable of depleting the ozone layer.
  D: This experiment tests the chemical property similarities between a chemical and chlorine. While this may be informative, it does not test whether the chemical would damage the ozone layer in the stratosphere.
  E: This experiment tests whether the chemical would break down under UV radiation. If the chemical can break down into harmless constituents in the lower atmosphere or before it reaches the stratosphere, then it is less likely to damage the ozone layer. However, if the chemical breaks down in the stratosphere and releases compounds like chlorine that can react and destroy the ozone, then it is not safe as a replacement for CFCs. 
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the work of Molina and Rowland on the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs.
  CFCs chemically react with ozone in the stratosphere and deplete the ozone layer.
  Testing a chemical to determine whether it would react with chlorine provides information about the chemical's potential to damage the ozone layer. 
  A, B, D, and E are not directly related to determining whether a chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer by manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and the harmful effects of increased concentrations of chlorine in the stratosphere. 
  The international ban on the production of ozone-depleting gases, such as CFCs, was adopted in the Montreal Protocol of 1987.
  The passage discusses the advocacy and work of Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, who alerted public policy makers to the fragility of the ozone layer.

Action: Answer("E")  
According to the passage, the most useful experiment for determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer would be "testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation." This is because the depletion of the ozone layer is caused by the breakdown of CFCs into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, testing whether a particular chemical would break down into its components under similar conditions would be useful in determining whether it could be used as a replacement for CFCs without causing similar damage to the ozone layer.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere, where they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
Choice (E) is the most useful test among the choices. Testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation allows one to determine if the chemical would produce any form of oxygen that would attack the ozone layer in the same way as CFCs.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, which leads to increased exposure to harmful ultraviolet radiation.
  The passage also discusses how the discovery of the problem with CFCs led to the development of an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  
A: This information is not useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs.
B: This information is not useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs in a way that does not damage the ozone layer.
C: This information could be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs in a way that does not contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer.
D: This information may be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs in a way that does not contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, but it is less relevant than option C.
E: This information could be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs in a way that does not contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer and how CFCs chemically attack and deplete it, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The passage mentions that the ozone layer is a thin, diffuse layer of ozone in the stratosphere, which screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  The passage also explains how Molina and Rowland studied two freon gases, types of CFCs, and observed that when released into the lower atmosphere, these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere, where they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
  According to the passage, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the power of negative evidence in science, and the need to search for evidence that disproves theories. It also mentions that experimental results can often have more than one explanation, rendering positive and negative evidence inconclusive. 
  Passage B discusses how astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit Uranus and Mercury. However, the predictions were not correct, leading the astronomers to revise their auxiliary assumptions. 
  A: Uranus is not described as a disturbing force.
  B: The sun is not described as a disturbing force.
  C: Neptune is not described as a disturbing force.
  D: Mercury's orbit was used to test Newton's laws of gravity, which were later rejected in favor of Einstein's general relativity. However, the question specifically asks for a "disturbing force", not a theory that is later rejected. 
  E: The moon is not discussed in the passage. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that scientists need auxiliary premises to derive a theory's prediction and the failure of the prediction might have more than one possible explanation.
  The passage gives examples from astronomy about how predictions might fail, and how auxiliary assumptions can lead to the discovery of new entities.
  A, B, C, D, and E are celestial objects.
  A and E are not mentioned after the first sentence of passage B.
  The text does not provide information that explicitly identifies which celestial object represents a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The question requires understanding of the term "disturbing forces" mentioned in passage A. According to passage A, in addition to theories scientific predictions need diverse additional premises that may involve aspects such as other theories, instrumentation, and disturbing forces to be able to deduce the correct outcome of an experiment. The understanding of the explanations of failed predictions and the auxiliary premises mentioned in passage B is also needed.
  A: Uranus is not mentioned in relation to disturbing forces, and the auxiliary assumption regarding the existence of other planets does not involve a disturbing force.
  B: The sun is not mentioned in relation to disturbing forces, and the auxiliary assumption regarding the existence of other planets does not involve a disturbing force.
  C: Neptune is not mentioned in relation to disturbing forces, and the auxiliary assumption regarding the existence of other planets does not involve a disturbing force.
  D: The hypothesis of the existence of Vulcan to explain the failed prediction regarding Mercury's behavior is based on the assumption that there is another planet that contributes as a disturbing force that impacts Mercury's orbit, which can potentially be a correct answer.
  E: The moon is not related to the explanation of failed predictions or auxiliary assumptions mentioned in passage B. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science.
  Passage B describes the discovery of Uranus and the calculation of its orbit using Newton's laws of gravitation. The calculations didn't yield the expected orbit, which led scientists to hypothesize the existence of another planet near Uranus that was affecting the orbit. This eventually led to the discovery of Neptune. 
  The reference to "disturbing forces" in passage A refers to additional factors that can affect the results of a scientific experiment or observation and potentially invalidate a hypothesis.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes the need for "auxiliary premises" to derive a theory's predictions.
  When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. (line 30-33)
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted orbits based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. (line 37-39)
  Passage B also mentions the discovery of Neptune, which was hypothesized to exist based on the observed orbit of Uranus.
Action: Answer("E")  
The answer is not one of the options given. None of the celestial bodies (Uranus, the sun, Neptune, Mercury) named in Passage B represents a "disturbing force". The only given option that is likely to be a disturbing force is the moon.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Popper's philosophy of science and the importance of negative evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B provides examples of how scientific theories are developed/modified based on empirical evidence.
  Disturbing forces, as described in Passage A, are auxiliary premises that could affect the outcome of an experiment.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A talks about Popper's ideas on positive and negative evidence, and that when an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either.
  Passage B describes the discovery of Uranus's mispredicted orbit; the astronomers had auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
  Passage B states that the astronomers "changed their assumptions" about the existence of other planets in an effort to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Passage B also describes that the astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet, Vulcan, when their predictions about Mercury's orbit were not borne out.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: When scientists derive predictions from a theory, they need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. A disturbing force is an external force or condition that interferes with the motion of an object so that its behavior is different from the way it would behave in the absence of such a force. 

Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation: In Passage B, the astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet, Vulcan, in the vicinity of Mercury to explain why their predictions were not borne out. Since the planet Vulcan was never found, some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Vulcan was an auxiliary assumption introduced to align the calculations with the observations. The hypothesis needed to be introduced to account for a disturbing force, which in this case was an error in auxiliary assumptions, other than the one made originally by the astronomers. Uranus, Jupiter, Neptune, and the moon do not serve as illustrations of a disturbing force in Passage B.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes Karl Popper's philosophy of science, where he argues that negative evidence is more powerful than positive evidence and emphasizes the search for negative evidence at the heart of scientific research.
  Passage B describes how astronomers at different points in history attempted to predict the orbit of planets using auxiliary premises, and how the failure of their predictions led to modifications of auxiliary premises, the hypothesizing of new planets, as well as the eventual modifications of Newton's law to Einstein's general theory of relativity.
  The passage B may be relevant to the question because it mentions "auxiliary" premises that can sometimes be sources of error when deriving a theory's predictions.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  "Disturbing forces" is a term coined by Popper in Passage A which refers to "auxiliary premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc.". 
  Passage B describes how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws of gravitation, and used assumption of no planets existing in the vicinity of Uranus as an auxiliary premise. These predictions turned out to be incorrect because of the gravitational pull of Neptune, which was unknown at the time.  
  The passage also describes another example of planetary orbit calculations, this time involving Mercury, which was explained only after the introduction of Einstein's theory of relativity.
Action: Answer("C")  
According to Passage B, astronomers made assumptions about the orbits of other planets when they tried to predict the orbit of Uranus, and as a result, their prediction was incorrect. One possible explanation for this was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions, which may have appealed to other theories or the correct functioning of instruments. Since Uranus was determined to be orbiting in a way that was not predicted, the astronomers revisited their assumptions and considered a disturbing force, which in this case was the gravitational pull of Neptune, located nearby. Therefore, Neptune best illustrates a "disturbing force" in the context described in Passage A.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?
Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.
  B: The primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers aud haudheld devices for reading text.
  C: The growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
  D: Any book will sell more copies ifit is published digitally thau if it is published traditionally.
  E: Digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The author believes that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines.
- Digital publishing is less expensive than traditional publishing because it eliminates physical inventory, warehousing, shipping, display, and returns of physical books.
- Traditional publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede to the demands of literary agents who seek higher royalty payments for their authors.
- Under competitive pressure from upstart digital-publishing firms, traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors.
Action: Answer("A")
Based on the information provided, the author would most likely agree with statement (A) that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at the point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in factories. 
  The digital publication of a book online involves no physical inventory, thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. 

Action: Answer("A") 
Reasoning: The author argues for the economic efficiency and convenience of the new digital model of publishing which eliminates whole categories of expenses for publishers and allows authors to be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product. The establishment of digital publishing firms is also expected to put traditional publishers under competitive pressure. Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing will be more economically efficient than traditional publishing. 
  Traditional publishers will need to adjust to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or they will lose their authors. 
A: This statement is supported by the author's argument that traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to compete with upstart digital-publishing firms.
B: This statement is not supported by the passage, as the author mentions the displacement of printed books rather than the use of computers and handheld devices as a primary threat to the spread of digital publishing.
C: This statement is not supported by the passage, which argues that digital publishing will eliminate the costs of physical inventory, shipping, and retail display, making it more economically efficient than traditional publishing, but does not mention the effects on actual book retail businesses.
D: The passage does not support this statement. While the author argues that digital publishing will be more economically efficient, they do not argue that this will automatically translate to higher sales for individual books.
E: This statement is not supported by the passage, as the author mentions the elimination of warehousing, shipping, and display costs, but does not mention the allocation of funds for advertising books.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that most digitized books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in factories.
  The author states that digital publishing is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing because it is more economically efficient and convenient for customers. It also eliminates whole categories of expense such as printing, selling, and distributing physical books.
  Initially, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, will be reluctant to accede, so the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure.
  Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors, or else they will lose their authors.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that most digital files of books will likely be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines. This will make book publishing less expensive and allow anyone with access to the internet to purchase printed books from a vast digital catalog that includes books that would have been designated "out of print." The digital publication of books will eliminate the costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying, and returning unsold books to publishers. Established publishing houses that are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing will initially be reluctant to embrace digital publishing.
A: The passage mentions that traditional publishers will need to reduce their redundant functions to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. It can be inferred that publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing may struggle to remain economically competitive.
B: The passage does not provide any information supporting the idea that the primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers and handheld devices for reading text.
C: The passage mentions that the digital publication of books eliminates the costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying, and returning unsold books to publishers. However, it does not suggest that the growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
D: The passage does not make any claim that any book will sell more copies if it is published digitally than if it is published traditionally.
E: The passage does not suggest that digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing. This is because digital publishing is more economically efficient and convenient for customers, and eliminates whole categories of expense associated with traditional publishing, such as printing, selling, and distributing physical books.
  
  A: This statement is supported by the author's argument that traditional publishers will need to reduce their redundant functions or else they will lose their authors. However, the author does not explicitly state that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
  
  B: This statement is not supported by the author's argument, as the author does not mention any threat to the spread of digital publishing caused by the use of computers and handheld devices for reading text.
  
  C: This statement is not supported by the author's argument, as the author does not mention anything about the growth of digital publishing revitalizing the book retail business.
  
  D: This statement is not supported by the author's argument. Although the author argues that digital publishing is more economically efficient and convenient for customers, and eliminates whole categories of expense associated with traditional publishing, the author does not make any claims about the relative sales figures of digital and traditional publishing.
  
  E: This statement is not supported by the author's argument. Although the author argues that digital publishing eliminates whole categories of expense associated with traditional publishing, the author does not make any claims about the effect of digital publishing on the advertising budgets of publishers.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing is likely to eventually replace traditional publishing due to economic efficiency and convenience for customers.
  The author also argues that digital publishing would eliminate the costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books, making it much less expensive than traditional publishing. 
  The author believes that under the digital publishing model, publishers would have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors.
  A: The author argues that traditional publishers would need to adjust their functions to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Thus, it can be inferred that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive. Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement A.
  B: Although the author discusses the use of computers and handheld devices for reading text, the argument pertains to the economics of digital publishing, not the technology used for reading. Thus, statement B cannot be inferred from the text.
  C: The author does not discuss the impact of digital publishing on the book retail business. Instead, the author argues that digital publishing would eliminate the costs of displaying physical books in retail stores, making it much less expensive than traditional publishing. Thus, statement C cannot be inferred from the text.

  The author believes that traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the new digital model of publishing is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing, despite the initial reluctance of large, established publishing houses.
  The author highlights several advantages of the digital model, such as a practically limitless digital catalog, cost savings associated with the elimination of physical inventory, and the ability to print on demand, as well as the potential for higher royalty payments for authors under the competitive pressure of upstart digital-publishing firms.
  The author does not provide evidence to support any of the other statements.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that digital publishing is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing, and that it will be more economically efficient and convenient for customers. By eliminating the costs of physical inventory, warehousing, shipping, and displaying physical books, among others, digital publishing will be less expensive for publishers. Moreover, anyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practically limitless digital catalog. However, it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to justify investment in book printing machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, initially, large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, will be reluctant to accede to the new digital model of publishing.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive, given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The author provides a translation of a proverb in lines 32–33 primarily in order to

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Dostoyevsky took a third position compared to the two opposing positions on the view of Russian literary productions. 
  Dostoyevsky did not agree that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was crucial for literature, and for him, there was no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  The fantastic had to be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believed in it.
  The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.
Action: Answer("E")  
Based on the passage, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky thought the view that art should further some societal end as incorrect, hence the answer is E.

  Dostoyevsky found unsatisfactory the radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society, and that sometimes a work of art may appear to serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful. 

Action: Answer("E") 

Dostoyevsky rejected the radical critics' position that art should further some societal end, insisting that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit.

  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit" rather than its usefulness to society.
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 6:
Knowledge: Dostoyevsky took a unique position in literary criticism, in which he believed that reality was the crucial source of literature. He believed that reality was more significant than just tangible elements and that the boundaries of the so-called real world must explode to perceive fantasy also. He believed that the requirement of some Russian critics that art must stand high above the present and everyday was incorrect.
A: Dostoevsky believed that the fantastic should be so bound up with the real that one almost believes in it. But, this is not directly related to his view about the statement of some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
B: The passage states that 'As a realist, he (Dostoyevsky) never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics since for Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.' Therefore, it can be inferred that he believed that reality was more than a list of mundane details of life. Therefore, this choice is correct.
C: The author states that Dostoyevsky was a realist who believed reality was the crucial source of literature. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses discretionary nonenforcement and how law enforcement agencies can use it to reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion. 
  Passage A suggests that enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. 
  The danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement. 
  Passage A suggests that capricious enforcement is not rare but it is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.

Action: Answer("E")  
Passage A suggests that capricious enforcement is not rare, but it is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced. Capricious enforcement is defined as "ruling or governing according to one's own caprice or whim without regard to the rights or needs of others." Capricious enforcement would involve not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law, which aligns with choice E.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains the technique of discretionary nonenforcement, which allows law enforcement agencies to reduce the costs of overinclusion without creating more loopholes.
  The passage also states that capricious enforcement is not unknown or rare but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the technique of discretionary nonenforcement used by law enforcement agencies to reduce costs of overinclusion of laws. 
  Capricious enforcement is not common, but it is not unknown and can result in enforcing laws selectively and without a clear principle of selection.
  
Action: Answer("E")  
Response 3:
Knowledge: Passage A discusses the method of discretionary nonenforcement as a means to reduce the costs of overinclusion in laws and regulations. The passage also observes that capricious enforcement (enforcement that is unpredictable and arbitrary) is  possible but does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the law enforcement agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced. The passage does not provide specifics on what capricious enforcement entails in practice.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses discretionary nonenforcement, which is a method of law enforcement where law enforcement agencies decline to prosecute violators.
  Passage A suggests that discretionary nonenforcement does not necessarily lead to capricious enforcement, i.e., arbitrary enforcement with no clear principle.
  Passage A also suggests that legislative oversight can ensure that law enforcement agencies do not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced. 
  
Action: Answer("E")  
  
The correct choice is E because Passage A suggests that capricious enforcement, which is the arbitrary enforcement of the law, is rare, and legislative oversight ensures that law enforcement agencies do not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced. Therefore, capricious enforcement is most likely due to not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Response 5:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to analyze the rational economic choice of a person who decides to commit a crime. Rational individuals choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  A: The passage does not describe an astronomer's use of a paradox to describe a phenomenon observed with new technologies.
  B: The passage does not describe a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other.
  C: The passage does not describe a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants.
  D: The passage does not describe a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
  E: The passage does not describe a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two opposing positions regarding deterrence of deliberate crimes, and presents an economic principle, utility maximization, which reconciles them.
  The utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  
Action: Answer("D")
The scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. Just as the judge uses knowledge from a different field, anthropology, to inform their legal decision, legal scholars are using knowledge from economics to inform their approach to crime deterrence, specifically the principle of utility maximization.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how the economic principle of utility maximization can reconcile two opposing positions on how to deter deliberate crimes.
  A: This describes the use of a paradox as a metaphor by an astronomer and is not related to the topic of the passage.
  B: This describes the use of a law of optics by a drawing instructor and is not related to the topic of the passage.
  C: This describes the use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete by a botanist and is not related to the topic of the passage.
  D: This describes the use of evidence from anthropology by a judge in a legal case, which is not the same as the use of the utility maximization principle by legal scholars to understand crime deterrence.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the utility maximization principle and its use in reconciling the two positions in the crime deterrence debate. The principle examines an individual's decision to commit a crime through a rational economic choice framework. According to the principle, a person committing a crime must weigh the costs and benefits of the action. Given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage discusses a debate in the legal community about the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes. It presents two sides to the debate: those who suggest changing societal norms and institutions to reduce the crime rate, and those who suggest increasing penalties and law enforcement efforts. The passage then introduces the principle of utility maximization, which suggests that a person's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to this principle, individuals will choose the action with the highest expected utility, which takes into account the probabilities of different outcomes and their corresponding utilities. The passage also suggests that the two positions in the debate are not fundamentally in conflict, but rather complementary, as they both affect the utility equation.

Action: Answer("D") 
D is the correct answer choice as it describes the use of evidence from another field (in this case, anthropology) to support a decision in a legal case. Similarly, some legal scholars use the economic principle of utility maximization, which is rooted in economics, to analyze the rationality of individuals’ decision to commit a crime and to inform legal decision-making.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about a debate between scholars who suggest that changing societal norms and institutions, and rehabilitating individuals convicted of crimes will reduce crime rates, and those scholars who suggest that increasing fines and penalties associated with criminal activity along with efficacious law enforcement is the best deterrence method.
  The two positions seem antithetical, but an economic principle called utility maximization reconciles the two positions.
  The utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  A person will be deterred from committing a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, is less than the expected utility from lawful activity. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The economic principle of utility maximization is being used in the debate about the best way to deter deliberate crimes.
  According to utility maximization principle, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  Increasing law enforcement and penalties for crimes reduce the expected utility from criminal activity, while increasing economic opportunities can increase the expected utility from lawful activity.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the passage, the most similar scenario to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. Just as legal scholars are using a principle from economics to support their argument and demonstrate that the two positions in the crime deterrence debate are actually complementary, a judge might use evidence from a different discipline, like anthropology, to support their decision or make a point in a legal case.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage explains the utility maximization principle, which holds that rational individuals choose the option that maximizes their expected utility or overall satisfaction. The same principle can be applied to analyzing an individual's decision to commit a crime. The passage further argues that both increasing penalties and improving access to economic institutions can affect the utility equation, making criminal activity less appealing. 
A: This answer choice is about the use of a metaphor to help describe a newly observed phenomenon. It does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate. 
B: This answer choice is about a drawing instructor using a law of optics to demonstrate a concept in a different field. It does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate. 
C: This answer choice is about a botanist using a quotation to make a point about the competitive nature of plants. It does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate. 
D: This answer choice is about a judge using evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case. It is not directly related to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate. 
E: This answer choice is about a mediator using a quotation from a novel to set a tone of collegiality before a bargaining session. It does not relate to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how the utility maximization principle can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime.
  A: The use of a paradox as a metaphor to explain a newly discovered phenomenon is not related to the concept of utility maximization.
  B: The use of a law of optics from physics is not related to the concept of utility maximization.
  C: The use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete is not related to the concept of utility maximization.
  D: The use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case is not related to the concept of utility maximization.
  E: The mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct is unrelated to the concept of utility maximization.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains that some legal scholars use the economic principle of utility maximization to analyze the rational reasons why some individuals choose to commit crimes. By using this principle, they suggest that increasing the expected cost of criminal activity or increasing the expected benefit of lawful activity are both effective methods at reducing the likelihood of criminal activity.
  
A: This choice is not relevant to the context of the passage. 
B: This choice is also not relevant to the passage and does not provide a scenario similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in crime deterrence debate.
C: This choice is not relevant to the context of the passage and does not provide a scenario similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in crime deterrence debate.
D: This choice is also not relevant to the passage, as there is no mention of a judge or evidence from anthropology being used to support a legal case.
E: This choice is not relevant to the context of the passage, as it is doesn't provide a scenario similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in crime deterrence debate.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The scientists conducting neutron bombardment experiments on uranium compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission between 1934 and 1939 but failed to recognize what they were witnessing.
  Theoretical physicists before 1934 had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Meitner was able to recognize the significance of the data related to the underlying theoretical considerations.
  The lack of precise chemical analyses, hampered by the minute quantities of substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, played a role in the delay.
  Additionally, researchers were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms through neutron bombardment.
  
A: This could have helped standardize the research, but it is not directly related to the recognition of the splitting of atoms.
B: This could have played a role in reducing the time to recognize the splitting of atoms. However, the passage suggests that the researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that atoms could be split in that context.
C: This is contrary to the statement in the passage that theoretical physicists before 1934 had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
D: While this could have helped in obtaining more results from the neutron bombardment of uranium and increasing the awareness of the phenomenon, it does not directly address what could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
E: This is irrelevant to the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium and the discovery of nuclear fission.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The scientists compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  The products remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  The relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Action: Answer("B") 
According to the passage, the physicists expected all the by-products of the neutron bombardment experiments to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Therefore, if the physicists did not have such expectations as choice B states, physicists might have recognized that they were splitting atoms earlier, reducing the amount of time it took for them to realize that atoms were being split.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission as a means of splitting atomic nuclei.
  It was not immediately clear to scientists at the time that they were witnessing nuclear fission.
  Lise Meitner, an Austrian physicist, made the connection between the experimental evidence and the theoretical predictions, coining the term "nuclear fission."
  The passage does not provide any information to suggest that any of the answer choices would have been more likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  In the context of the discovery of nuclear fission, researches had increasing evidence of the nuclear fission process without recognizing what they were witnessing, and this was partly due to their expectation that by-products would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
Option analysis:
  A: The passage does not provide information about the similarity or differences of the research techniques used by the physicists. Therefore, this option is not the answer.
  B: The physicists did have expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products; they expected them to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. The passage states this expectation was one of the reasons why the by-products remained unidentified. Therefore, this option is not the answer.
  C: The theoretical calculations indicating that atoms could be split had been produced by some theoretical physicists even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated. Therefore, this option is not the answer.
  D: The passage does not provide information about the number or concentration of physicists obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium. Therefore, this option is not the answer.
  E: The passage does not provide information about the neutron bombardment of any substance other than uranium. Therefore, this option is not the answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  In the early experiments of neutron bombardment of uranium, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The products of the neutron bombardment experiments remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  It was Lise Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: According to the passage, the expectation that the products of the neutron bombardment experiments would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition was a significant factor that led physicists to overlook the evidence that uranium atoms were being split. Therefore, if physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they may have realized the significance of the data earlier and discovered that atoms were being split. Answer B suggests this scenario, so it is the best answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Physicists were compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939 without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Scientists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  Researchers were not receptive to the possibility of breaking atoms apart in neutron-bombardment experiments aimed at achieving such a result.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and it was she who finally recognized that they were splitting uranium atoms.
A: The passage does not discuss the relevance of using the same research techniques in this situation.
B: According to the passage, one of the reasons why the products remained unidentified was that researchers were expecting them to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
C: The passage actually affirms that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
D: The passage does not discuss how many physicists were conducting experiments in the neutron bombardment of uranium in order to establish a correlation between this and a faster realisation of atom splitting.
E: The passage does not discuss experiments in the neutron bombardment of any substance other than uranium.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The physicists conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium, and compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Researchers were not receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission, and a common view was that it was impossible to break atoms apart.
  Meitner was able to recognize the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with physicist Otto Frisch.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: If the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium didn't have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the byproducts, they would have been more open to recognizing that atoms were being split. According to the passage "...more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition...it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link." So, if the physicists were not biased by their expectations, they would have more easily recognized the evidence, and realized that atoms were being split. Answer choice B is the correct answer.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939 without recognizing what they were witnessing. Although some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen. The discovery of nuclear fission was achieved through the research of many physicists in different locations, including Italian, German, Austrian, and Swedish physicists. Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection to the experimental findings of neutron bombardment of uranium. 
A: The fact that the physicists were using the same research techniques does not necessarily impact the time it took for them to realize that atoms were being split.
B: The physicists have expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, which contributed to their failing to recognize the significance of the data earlier.
C: Some theoretical physicists produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, but the researchers were not receptive to the possibility that they could actually split atoms by bombarding them with neutrons.
D: More physicists focusing on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium may have helped to identify the significance of the data earlier.
E: The passage does not mention whether physicists conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium, so this option is not directly relevant to the question.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about how physicists discovered the splitting of uranium atoms.
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing. 
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  It was the right conceptual link that was lacking, so finding that right link could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
A: The passage does not give any indication that the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques. This choice is not relevant to reducing the amount of time it took to discover the splitting of atoms.
B: The passage states that the products remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. This choice directly contradicts the passage and is therefore incorrect.
C: This choice is incorrect because the passage states that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
D: The passage indicates that physicists had already been conducting experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium and achieving results similar to those of Fermi and others but were not recognizing what they were witnessing. Therefore, conducting more experiments would not reduce the amount of time it took for them to realize that atoms were being split. 
E: This choice is irrelevant and not discussed in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
The passage describes how scientists did not realize they were achieving nuclear fission through neutron bombardment of uranium. They had been compiling evidence of this achievement but were not recognizing what they were witnessing. It took several years for the crucial theoretical connection to be made by Lise Meitner, despite the fact that some theoretical physicists had already produced calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to break atoms apart.

A: This information does not relate to the question, it discusses the research techniques used by the scientists.
B: This option seems plausible as it states that physicists had not formed a particular expectation of the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, and hence were not dismissing any unexpected results that were obtained.
C: This option contradicts the knowledge which states that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations that indicated that in principle it was possible to break atoms apart.
D: While this option seems harmless, it does nothing to address the question prompt. Even if more physicists had been studying the neutron bombardment of uranium, it is unclear how this would enable them to recognize that they were achieving nuclear fission.
E: The answer choices seem to emphasise studying the objectives of atomic scientists while studying uranium bombardment. So, this option is irrelevant since it describes scientists conducting experiments in the neutron bombardment of another substance rather than uranium.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Three positions are presented and each is elaborated in detail.
  B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.

  D: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be superior to the first two.
  E: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be inferior to the second.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage presents three positions that were prevalent in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time. The first two positions are presented briefly, and the third position that Dostoyevsky took is elaborated in detail and differentiated from the other two. While Dostoyevsky's position is presented as his own and not necessarily superior to the other two, it is shown to be distinct from them in several ways. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the material presented in the passage is that three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail, which is option B.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage presents three positions on Russian literary criticism. The first paragraph outlines the opposing views, while the second paragraph elaborates on Dostoyevsky's position. Thus, the passage presents the three positions and differentiates the third from the first two in detail. Option B is the most accurate description of the organization of the material presented in the passage.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage presents three positions regarding literature: one that art should stand high above the present and everyday; the radical view or belief that art should be useful to create a new society by exposing want and injustice; and a third position taken by Dostoevsky which is differentiated from the first two. The passage elaborates on the third position in detail and compares it to the other two positions, showing how Dostoevsky's understanding of reality as more than just the tangible differs from the radical critics, and how his definition of artistry as the ability to write well and express the author's thoughts in characters and images differs from the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work are of secondary importance. Therefore, the best answer is "B".
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage presents three different positions regarding the role of literature in society and how it should represent reality. The first two positions are presented in the beginning of the passage and are briefly explained, while the third position, which is Dostoyevsky's, is elaborated on in detail throughout the passage, specifically in how it differs from the first two positions. Therefore, choice B is the best answer.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage presents three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. The first two directions are described in the first paragraph, and the third position established by Dostoyevsky is introduced in the second paragraph. The rest of the passage goes into detail about Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality, his definition of "artistry", his criticism of the utilitarian view of art, and his perspective on the usefulness of art. Therefore, the third position is differentiated from the first two in detail, making choice (B) the correct answer.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first position maintained that art was above the present and the everyday.
  The second position maintained that literature should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position, which was different from the first two.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than that of the radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear was a contradiction in terms.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage presents three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time, with the third position being differentiated from the first two in detail. Dostoyevsky's position is a realist understanding of reality that did not distinguish between fantasy and reality and advocated for artistic merit standing as the sole arbiter of the value of a literary work.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The passage presents three positions on Russian literary criticism, which are:
- Art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
- Art should find its sources in concrete reality and contribute to the creation of a new society; literature should be useful.
- Art should explode the boundaries of the so-called real world; reality is necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and the fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real.

The third position is differentiated from the other two in detail, showing Dostoyevsky's deeper understanding of reality and his belief that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The passage presents three different positions regarding the role of literature: one position that art should be separate from concrete reality, another opposite position that art should only come from concrete reality and be useful, and a third position that reality is crucial to literature but also allows for the fantastic and that literary works should stand or fail on their artistic merit. The passage primarily focuses on the third position, explaining it in detail and contrasting it both with the second position and with the utilitarian approach to literature that both the first and second positions embody. Therefore, choice B - "Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail." - is the most accurate description of the organization of the material presented in the passage.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage presents three different positions in Russian literary criticism of Dostoyevsky's time. Paragraph 1 describes the two opposing positions, while paragraph 2 presents Dostoevsky's third position and differentiates it from the first two. Therefore, choice B, which states that the third position is differentiated from the first two in detail, is the most accurate description of the organization of the material presented in the passage.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.

  Passage A describes evolutionary psychology's approach to human behavior and the evolution of altruistic mechanisms.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) to human behavior that the agent of the behavior may not acknowledge.
  A: This statement describes the methodology of evolutionary psychology rather than exemplifying its conspiracy theory aspect.
  B: This statement is an example of evolutionary psychology's examination of human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint, but it does not exemplify its conspiracy theory aspect.
  C: This statement describes a behavior that evolutionary psychology might explain from an evolutionary standpoint, but it does not exemplify its conspiracy theory aspect.
  D: This statement exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory." It describes how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, even though the agent of the behavior may not be aware of this motive.
  E: This statement describes early human social organization, but it does not exemplify evolutionary psychology's conspiracy theory aspect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The question asks for an assertion in passage A that shows what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  Passage B states that evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory since it explains behavior by assigning an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly admit or is not aware of.
  Option A states that evolutionary psychologists examine human behavior through the theory of evolution but does not connect to the idea of a "conspiracy theory".
  Option B states that altruism is a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology, but does not connect with the idea of a "conspiracy theory".
  Option C describes what an altruistic individual does, but does not connect to the idea of a "conspiracy theory".
  Option D assert that genes may promote their self-propagation through seemingly unselfish actions and exemplifies what passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  Option E describes how early humans lived in small, kin-based groups but does not connect to the idea of a "conspiracy theory".
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes evolutionary psychology which explains human behavior from the standpoint of evolution and how it contributes to individual's reproductive success.
  Passage A suggests that altruism may have originally arisen in response to cues like physical resemblance that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. These psychological states could have increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes.
  Passage B calls evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest, that the agent of behavior is not openly acknowledging. 
  The author of Passage B indicates that the interest in the proliferation of genes can explain promoting the welfare of one's children but there can also be other interests that explain the same behavior.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A explains the evolutionary perspective on altruism and how genes promoting self-propagation may have operated through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. 
  Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a kind of conspiracy theory because it assumes that behavior is motivated by an interest in gene proliferation that the agent of the behavior may not explicitly acknowledge.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolution and how it can explain certain types of human behavior, such as altruism. It also suggests that apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system.
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory because it attributes hidden or unconscious motives to human behavior.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: In passage A, the author explains that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother rushing to help her injured child. The suggestion is that evolutionary psychology can explain behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of. This idea is similar to what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage A presents evolutionary psychology, which seeks to explain human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint and how it could promote the propagation of genetic material of related individuals, where genes that promote their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology, arguing that it explains behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge. Thus, the interest is implicit and not openly stated. The author claims that most often, all sorts of interests would explain any given behavior.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes how evolutionary psychology attempts to explain human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. It argues that humans engage in apparently altruistic behavior because genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology by describing it as a "kind of conspiracy theory" that "explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of." According to passage B, just because a behavior promotes the self-propagation of genes does not mean that it can only be explained by that interest. There may be other interests that also explain the behavior.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The author of passage B considers evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory." The term "conspiracy theory" means a theory that explains an event or behavior as the result of a secret plan by usually powerful people or groups. In this context, passage B probably means that evolutionary psychology explains human behavior as promoting the propagation of genes, even though humans may not be consciously aware of it.
  A: Explaining human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution is the general approach of evolutionary psychology but does not exemplify what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
  B: The problem of altruism in evolutionary psychology is a difficult one, but it does not exemplify what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
  C: The definition of altruism presented here is correct, but it does not exemplify what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
  D: Genes promoting their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
  E: Early humans living in small, kin-based groups does not exemplify what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the idea of evolutionary psychology explaining behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution.
  The author of Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or may not even be aware of.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: In passage A, the idea that "genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" (line 6) seems to be the best example of what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory. The assertion implies that unconscious genetic self-interest may be the true motivation behind seemingly altruistic behavior. Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology explains behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior may not acknowledge or may not be aware of, which is similar to the idea that unconscious genetic self-interest motivates behavior. Therefore, choice D is the best answer.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A describes that evolutionary psychology explains human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior.
  Passage A explains that the problem of altruism is difficult to explain from an evolutionary standpoint.
  Passage A argues that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory that explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of.
  Passage B argues that many interests could explain any given behavior.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the autobiographies of Native Americans and how most scholars have focused on written documents that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. 
  The scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history and cultural constructs of highly diverse Native American peoples.
  The word "bicultural composite authorship" is used in line 5 to describe the written as-told-to life histories that represented a collaboration between Native American subjects and non-Native American recorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which Native American cultures conveyed personal history prior to contact with European cultures. Specifically, it discusses how scholars have tended to overlook modes of communication that were traditional and pre-literate. It notes that Native American cultures did not always share the same assumptions as Europeans about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of autobiography.
  
A: This choice is not accurate. The passage does not discuss writings based on artifacts and oral traditions of another culture; nor is the question asking for a definition of the phrase that is implied in the passage.
  
B: This choice is not accurate. The passage does not discuss the contribution of two people each from a different culture.
  
C: This choice is not accurate. The passage does not discuss how bicultural composite authorship is compiled from different writings of people from two different cultures.
  
D: This choice conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5. The passage describes "bicultural composite authorship" as referring to as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. This means that the written work was initially created by a Native American, but was later edited by someone from another culture.
  
E: This choice is not accurate. Although it is true that Native American cultures relied heavily on oral communication, it is not an accurate summary of the concept of bicultural composite authorship. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the limitations of scholarship that focuses solely on written, as-told-to autobiographies of Native Americans, which are the product of "bicultural composite authorship." This term implies that two cultures–Native American and a non-Native collaborator's–are involved in the creation of the work. Additional context later in the passage reveals that the resulting written texts typically reflect the cultural assumptions of the non-Native editors and readers more than those of the Native American subjects.
A: The term does not imply that the finished work is based solely on artifacts and oral traditions of another culture.
B: This describes collaboration between two cultures but not necessarily their equal contribution to the product.
C: This describes a textual artifact, but not one that results from "bicultural composite authorship" or involving Native Americans. 
D: This accurately describes the nature of "bicultural composite authorship" — that the texts are written by a non-Native collaborator, based on the recitations of Native Americans, and then edited/revised to some extent by the collaborator. 
E: This describes the initial stages of the production of a written autobiography, but it does not capture the totality of the bicultural process in which it is situated.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses how scholars tend to overlook traditional modes of communicating personal history in Native American cultures when studying Native American autobiographies.
- The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe a specific type of Native American autobiography that scholars have focused on. 
- The passage explains that these autobiographies are "as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators."
- The passage further explains that these autobiographies are the result of collaboration between non-Native American collaborators and Native American storytellers. 

Action: Answer("D")
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe autobiographies that were written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture. This answer is supported by the information provided in the passage about how these autobiographies were produced through collaboration between non-Native American collaborators and Native American storytellers.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that most scholars who have studied the autobiographies of Native Americans have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators — that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
  The idea is that a person from one cultural group (e.g. Native American person) is telling their life story to a person from another cultural group (e.g. European), and that the resulting written document is a collaboration between the two cultures. 
  A: The passage does not mention any artifacts and oral traditions.
  B: The passage does not mention that both individuals contribute in the same way.
  C: The passage does not mention a compilation of writings by people of different cultures.
  D: This accurately describes the concept of 'bicultural composite authorship' as it is used in the passage. 
  E: This option is incorrect because the passage does not mention oral communication between members of two different cultures. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

  Dunham participated in the dances herself, allowing her to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, learn the techniques, and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
Action: Answer("C") 
From the passage, we can infer that Dunham's work in anthropology was different from that of most other anthropologists in the 1930s because she "generally eschewed... caution and participated in the dances herself." This suggests that she employed a participative approach in performing research, which is described as diverging radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Therefore, the best answer is C: employed a participative approach in performing research.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's role as an anthropologist in the 1930s, detailing her approach to research and the techniques she employed to gain a thorough understanding of traditional Caribbean dance forms and their origins in African culture.
A: The passage states that Dunham participated in the dances she was observing, thus suggesting that her fieldwork involved a high degree of immersion and engagement. However, the passage does not explicitly state that her fieldwork was significantly longer in duration than that of other anthropologists during this period.
B: The passage notes that Dunham was interested in the origins of traditional Caribbean dance forms in African culture and drew connections between these dance traditions and modern North American dance forms. However, the passage does not suggest that her work in anthropology differed significantly from that of other anthropologists because of her ability to relate these traditions to her own culture.
C: The passage explicitly states that Dunham's approach to research "diverged radically" from that of her colleagues in anthropology who advised her to remain detached from the dances she was observing. Dunham's approach was participatory in nature and involved her personally engaging with the dances she was studying, thereby gaining a more nuanced understanding of these complex cultural practices.
D: The passage acknowledges that Dunham's work had significant cultural and artistic implications, paving the way for African American dance to be recognized as an art form in its own right. However, the passage does not suggest that Dunham attached a particularly high degree of political significance to her research.
E: The passage does not suggest that Dunham had prior familiarity with the cultural practices of the peoples she set out to study. In fact, the passage implies that dance ethnology was a relatively neglected area of social research prior to Dunham's work, and that few social scientists were well-versed in dance techniques at this time.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
  C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed
  E: to introduce the main topic to be discussed to present a view that will be argued against
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study by Solnick and Hemenway is mentioned in both Passage A and Passage B.
  Passage A uses the study to illustrate the phenomenon of rivalry, and how we tend to compare ourselves with our reference group to determine our happiness.
  Passage B posits a different view, suggesting that people feel successful when they create value, and that desiring to create value is beneficial to society.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A examines the paradox that richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. It argues that people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. In a study by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options. The majority chose the first because they were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. The theory that we care most about one-upmanship is not the best explanation supported by the evidence.
Action: Answer("B") 
The authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to present a view that will be argued against (in passage A) and to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon (in passage B).
Response 2:
Knowledge: The question asks which pair of passages accurately describes why the Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in the two passages. 

Passage A discusses research concerning happiness and wealth and how people compare their income with some norm. Two phenomena, habituation, and rivalry push up the norm. The passage argues that how people compare themselves to their 'reference group' is crucial for happiness. It then talks about the Solnick and Hemenway study and how it demonstrated the phenomenon of rivalry and how people care about their relative positions. 

Passage B follows up on the discussion of the Solnick and Hemenway study and presents a hypothesis that the income difference is not what matters, but rather the feeling of success it brings. The passage argues that wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness rather than wanting to have more than others. 

Action: Answer("B") 

The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in passage A to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided, and it is mentioned in passage B to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B both reference Solnick and Hemenway's study, but for different reasons.
  Passage A states that the study supports the idea that people's happiness is influenced by their relative position with others.
  Passage B argues against the idea that people's happiness is solely influenced by one-upmanship and instead contends that people's happiness is influenced by their sense of success and creating value.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B mention the Solnick and Hemenway study.
  A: One author presents a view that will be argued against and the other provides evidence for that explanation of a phenomenon.
  B: One author presents a view that will be argued against and the other provides evidence for that explanation of a phenomenon.
  C: One author provides evidence for an explanation of a phenomenon and the other presents a view for which additional evidence will be provided.
  D: One author provides evidence for an explanation of a phenomenon and the other introduces the main topic to be discussed.
  E: One author introduces the main topic to be discussed and the other presents a view that will be argued against.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B mention the same study by Solnick and Hemenway.
  Passage A mentions the study to explain the phenomenon of rivalry and how people compare themselves with their "reference group" which is crucial for happiness.
  Passage B mentions the study to present evidence for the idea that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and passage B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study found that people often choose to be poorer in absolute terms if they can improve their relative position.
  Passage A uses the study to argue that people care about relative prosperity and that comparisons with others affect happiness.
  Passage B uses the study to argue that earning more makes people feel successful, and that it is the feeling of success that provides the happiness.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and B discuss different explanations for the relationship between income and happiness.
  Solnick and Hemenway study asked people to choose between two options with different income levels and social status.
  Passage A mentions the study to support its argument that social comparison matters for happiness.
  Passage B mentions the study to provide evidence for its argument that people view money as a measure of success and a way to create value.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between wealth, success, and happiness.
  Solnick and Hemenway study was conducted to demonstrate how people reference their level of success to others, using income as a measuring stick.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B present different views on why earning more money makes people happier.
  Solnick and Hemenway's study was mentioned in both passages.
  Passage A describes the Solnick and Hemenway study as evidence that people are happier to be poorer if their relative position improves.
  Passage B describes the Solnick and Hemenway study as not fully explaining the motive for individuals to demonstrate their superiority or desire to create value.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.
  C: It forms part of a speculative hypothesis that the author presents for its interest in relation to the main topic rather than as part of an argument.
  D: It serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
  E: It forms part of the author's concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage argues that while profits from technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a democratizing force, narrowing the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various technological developments, such as the printing press, public libraries, personal computers, and broadcast technology. The gradual diffusion of benefits across society is the result of a general tendency of the market system to structure prices to the consumers so as to make new technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The reference to maximization of financial success reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development by serving as part of a causal explanation for why entrepreneurs and investors structure their prices to consumers in a way that diffuses access to the products across society. In other words, the argument is that entrepreneurs and investors are motivated by financial gain, but the market system incentivizes them to make their technologies accessible to an ever-larger share of the population, leading to democratizing effects over time.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The paragraph discusses the democratizing impact of technological development under the market system.
  The author argues that the tendency of the market system is to diffuse access to new technology across society.
  The paragraph suggests that entrepreneurs and investors have to expand their market by structuring prices in a way that makes their technologies accessible to an ever-larger share of the population.

Action: Answer("D")
The reference to maximization of financial success serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development. Specifically, the author argues that entrepreneurs and investors have to expand their market by structuring their prices in a way that makes their technologies accessible to an ever-larger share of the population, which is how market competition drives prices down and diffuses access to new technology across society as a result.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The paragraph is discussing how the market system, through the process of maximization of financial success, tends to make new technologies more accessible over time. The passage provides several examples of this phenomenon, such as the distribution of books, the democratizing force of personal computing, and the availability of broadcast entertainment. 
A: The sentence in question does not summarize the benefits of technological development. 
B: The sentence in question is not presented as a logical conclusion from the data in the preceding paragraphs. 
C: The sentence in question is not a speculative hypothesis, but rather a causal explanation. 
D: The sentence in question reinforces the thesis of the passage that new technologies have served as a democratizing force overall. 
E: The sentence in question is not a concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The paragraph describes how technological developments, though initially benefiting only a few people, ultimately democratize the benefits across society. The market system is the primary driver of this democratization, as entrepreneurs and investors need to expand their market to maximize their financial success, which involves making their technology accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. 
A: This choice is partially correct in identifying that the passage describes benefits of technological development, but it does not accurately represent the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success. 
B: This choice is partially correct in identifying that the reference serves as a logical conclusion, but it does not accurately reflect the function of the reference in relation to the whole passage.

Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives
  E: eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the concept of voluntary versus involuntary risk and how it relates to policy decisions around risk management. The author argues that the distinction between these types of risks is not always clear-cut, and that relying on laypeople's judgments about voluntariness can be misleading. The author ultimately concludes that risk-management policies should be guided by a desire to save lives, rather than considerations of voluntariness.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses different perspectives on whether government should intervene to protect people from risks. Public and expert judgments about whether to intervene differ, and policy experts tend to focus on saving lives, whereas laypeople care about whether risks are voluntarily undertaken. However, the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks can be ambiguous and influenced by other factors. The author argues that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of people's judgments about voluntariness, and that the government should try to save as many lives as possible, subject to limited resources.
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the distinction that people make between voluntarily and involuntarily incurred risks and how that affects policy decisions. The author suggests that the distinction is not always helpful and that policy decisions should be based on a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.

Action: Answer("C") 

The author expresses skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy. In the author's view, policy decisions should not be determined solely by whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary. Instead, the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible, within the constraints of public and private resources devoted to risk reduction, and departures from this principle should be justified on other grounds.
Response 3:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the distinction between lay and expert judgments about risk and the role of voluntariness in this distinction. The author argues that judgments about voluntariness are often unclear and sometimes stem from biases, and suggests that regulatory policy should focus on saving as many lives as possible with the available resources.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the difference between lay and expert judgments about risk, arguing that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is often confused and of little utility in guiding policy decisions. The author suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited resources devoted to risk reduction, and that criteria other than voluntariness should guide risk-management policy.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
The author expresses skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage presents an argument that judgments based on whether a risk is "voluntary" or "involuntary" are not useful in guiding policy decisions about risk management. 
  The author argues that governmental policy should attempt to save as many lives as possible, subject to the resources available for risk reduction, and that notions of voluntariness should not be used as a justifying factor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author distinguishes between laypeople and policy experts' judgments about risks. Laypeople are concerned about whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily or not, while policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake. The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not so clear-cut, and that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is often misunderstood and not a useful guide for policy decisions.
  The author suggests the government's regulatory policies should be guided by an understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness and should attempt to save as many lives as possible.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the limitations of characterizing risks as "voluntary" or "involuntary" in guiding government policy decisions. The author argues that while laypeople tend to care whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily, the distinction is often unclear or based on selective attention. The author therefore argues that policy decisions should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can subject to limited resources.

Action: Answer("C") 
The author expresses skepticism of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide for deciding government risk-management policy, arguing that notions of voluntariness may be rooted in other judgments rather than truly voluntary or involuntary risks. This implies answer choice C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Response 9:
Knowledge: The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise
  C: concerned that research results supporting it may omit crucial anecdotal evidence indicating pitfalls in its use
  D: approving of its use on the grounds that its success is experimentally supported and can be psychologically explained

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
The passage argues that patenting biological materials does not necessarily lead to the prevention of basic research. Even basic research may be able to continue without a patent holder suing or enjoining the researcher, according to the author.
A: The author argues against the claim that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research.
B: The author argues against the claim that the patent holder will probably sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
C: The author does not mention anything about the university prohibiting the research to avoid being sued.
D: The author suggests that there is a good chance that the researcher will not be held liable for patent infringement if she conducts basic research because there has been a tradition of respecting a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. 
E: The author does not mention anything about the corporation offering to fund the research. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The author mentions that researchers who oppose biotechnology patents may fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials.
  However, the author notes that patent litigation is usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee, and that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. 
  Moreover, the author suggests that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate because they bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The article explains that some researchers are afraid that patent holders of biological materials will restrict or deny access to them if any other researcher wants to use them for basic research. While some researchers opposed to biotechnology patents seem to confuse patent rights with access, it is unlikely that a patent holder would sue a researcher who was conducting basic, noncommercial research and was not using patented materials for commercial purposes. Patent cases respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the perceived threats to basic research that arise from restrictions on access to research materials due to patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions. It is noted that some researchers fear that patenting biological materials may hinder research by restricting access to research materials unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken, but the author asserts that such restrictions are not necessarily enforced against researchers, particularly those conducting only noncommercial research. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly support the idea that discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential should be patentable for intellectual property protection.
  However, there are concerns about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research due to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals, and the restrictions may arise through the enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement.
  There has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  It is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
Prediction: 
  The author predicts that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued, based on the fact that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Therefore, the best answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses concerns about the impact of biotechnology patenting on basic research. Some researchers worry that patent holders may restrict access to research materials, while others think that patents provide incentives to innovate. The article asserts that patent holders are unlikely to sue researchers engaging in non-commercial research, and that judges have historically recognized a non-commercial research exception to patent infringement.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents often mistake patent rights with control of access to biological materials. The author believes that patents will spur rather than hinder basic research, and that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable because there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The author of the passage argues that granting a patent does not imply granting the right to deny access to the biological materials. Instead, the patents bring economic rewards to scientists.
  The passage suggests that enforcing a patent right against a researcher engaged in basic, noncommercial research is unlikely. 
  The passage also highlights the tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. 
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses how restrictions on access to research materials, such as cell lines, are feared to arise through operation of a patent right or operational agreements.
  Researchers who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology confuse patent rights with control of access to biological materials. Whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher is questionable.
  There has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
Answer: 
Action: Answer("D")
The passage states that "Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement." which suggests that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The article explains that concerns have arisen about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research related to restrictions on access to research materials such as genetic sequences, cell lines and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from patent enforcement or through operation of a contractual agreement. The researcher fears that a patent holder or the owner of biological materials might refuse to make those materials available unless a costly materials-transfer or license agreement is undertaken, and that patenting biological materials might result in the patent holder's attempting to enjoin further research through a legal action. In reality, it is unlikely that patents would hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate, and it is likely that patents will actually spur research. Moreover, judges have respected a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the subtractive method and its use in producing brain scans that depict a differential rate of oxygen use in response to various cognitive tasks. 
  The author argues that this method creates an illusion of functional localization that supports the modular theory of mind, even though mental activity may not be decomposable into independent modules. Instead, mental processes are likely properties of a more general, distributed mental activity.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the subtractive method, which is used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce images that show the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain during different cognitive tasks.
  The passage indicates that the subtractive method can create an illusion of neat functional localization because it subtracts out distributed brain functions.
  The author is critical of the modular theory of mind and suggests that it is likely that various mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the subtractive method used in FMRI as a way of creating brain images that depict differential rates of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The author is critical of the modular theory of mind as a conceptual basis for interpreting these images, arguing that mental activity may not be decomposable into discrete modules.
  The author suggests that the subtractive method may be problematic because it masks distributed brain functions, giving a false impression of neat functional localization.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the subtractive method of analyzing brain scans, which is used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  The subtractive method takes a baseline measurement of brain activity during a control condition, and then subtracts that from a measurement taken while a subject is performing a cognitive task in order to produce an image that localizes brain activity associated with that task.
  The author is critical of the modular theory of mind, which posits that mental processes can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The author suggests that the modular theory of mind may not accurately reflect the complexity of mental processes and the distributed nature of brain activity, and questions the validity of using brain scans to support this theory.
Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the passage, the author would be most likely to agree with statement D: "The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized." The author argues that the modular theory of mind may not accurately reflect the complexity of mental processes and brain activity. The author criticizes the subtractive method as giving an "illusion of neat functional localization," and suggests that "this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions." This implies that the author would view the subtractive method as potentially misleading in supporting the modular theory of mind.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce maps that reveal areas of the brain with increased metabolic activity while a subject performs cognitive tasks. The subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, which produces a false impression of neat functional localization. The passage notes that the modular theory of mind is sometimes attractive because of how well it appears to be supported by the results of the subtractive method.
  
A: The passage does not make this claim. It describes the subtractive method as a way of producing functional maps of the brain that reveal areas with increased metabolic activity during cognitive tasks, and how this method can produce a false impression of neat functional localization. 
B: The passage does not make this claim. While the passage does describe Uttal's view that mental processes may not be decomposable into independent modules, it does not make a claim about the specific neuroimaging method he'd prefer to use in research.
C: The passage does not make this claim. While the passage contrasts the modular theory of mind with the idea that emotions are seated in the amygdala and reason in the prefrontal cortex, it does not say anything specifically about brain scans of individuals experiencing anger or any other specific emotion. 
D: This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. The author of the passage argues that the modular theory of mind may be fundamentally flawed because it assumes that mental processes can be decomposed into independent modules or components that are localized in specific regions of the brain. The author suggests that the resulting functional localization maps may be misleading because they are produced using a subtractive method that obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and cognitive task conditions.
E: The passage does not make this claim. While the passage describes the scientific basis of the subtractive method, it does not dispute that the images produced by this method do depict differential rates of oxygen use in the brain. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans, specifically in relation to the modular theory of mind and the subtractive method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  The subtractive method involves taking a baseline measurement of brain activity and then subtracting it from the measurement taken while a cognitive task is being performed, thus highlighting the areas of the brain that are specifically activated by that task.
  The author argues that while the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, it may be giving a false impression of neat functional localization and overlooking the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI). The method produces results that obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both control and experimental conditions. The results of the subtractive method do not necessarily support the modular theory of mind because mental activity may not be decomposable into separate and distinct modules. It is also not clear whether localized brain regions can be identified that correspond to different components of mental activity. Some critics of the modular theory argue that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain.
Action: Answer("D") 
The author of the passage argues that the subtractive method produces an illusion that brain functions are neatly localized and that this illusion supports the modular theory of mind. However, the author also suggests that the modular theory may be problematic because it is unclear whether mental activity can be decomposed into modular components, or whether localized brain regions correspond to these components. Therefore, the author does not necessarily agree that the subtractive method supports the modular theory of mind, but rather argues that it creates the appearance of supporting it.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The subtractive method involves taking a baseline measurement in a control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing a cognitive task, and then subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to obtain an image of the brain at work.
  The author is critical of the modular theory of mind, which holds that the mind consists of separate and distinct modules that are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The author suggests that the modular theory of mind is flawed because mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
Action: Answer("D")  
Reasoning: The author is critical of the modular theory of mind and suggests that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules. The author argues that the entire brain is active in both the control condition and the on-task condition in the subtractive method. The author notes that differential brain scans produced using the subtractive method may create a false impression of neat functional localization, which is attractive in part because it supports the modular theory of mind. Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The passage describes the subtractive method used to produce brain scans with functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI). The subtractive method involves taking a baseline measurement in a control condition and then subtracting that measurement from a second measurement taken while a subject performs a cognitive task. The resulting image is thought to depict the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.

A: The passage does not suggest that empirical results derived using the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications. In fact, the passage describes the subtractive method as valid for medical diagnosis in the case of diagnosing a brain tumor via brain scan.

B: The passage suggests that Uttal's view that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules is valid. However, it does not explicitly relate this view to the subtractive method or suggest that the subtractive method supports this view.

C: The passage does not discuss brain scans of individuals experiencing anger or suggest that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.

D: The passage argues that the subtractive method is problematic for supporting the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion of neat functional localization that obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. Therefore, the author is most likely to disagree with this statement.

E: The passage does suggest that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain, and it explains the method in detail, so this statement is incorrect.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the subtractive method and questions the validity of the modular theory of mind, which depends upon localizing brain functions. The author analyzes that the use of neuroimaging in interpreting psychological phenomena depends on the premise that the mind can be analyzed into distinct modules and further assumes that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. The author critiques this premise and argues that both mental activity and the physical processes that constitute them are not decomposable into independent modules. Instead of separate entities, the author argues that the different mental processes are likely to be general properties of mental activity that are distributed throughout the brain. The author argues that there is a problem in cleanly separating emotions from reason-giving as it undermines human experience. Therefore, the author would disagree with any statement that suggests that the subtractive method supports the modular theory of mind.

But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research tool in the field of psychology and critiques the modular theory of mind, which posits that different mental functions are governed by discrete modules in the brain.
  The passage explains the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), whereby the rate of oxygen use in parts of the brain is compared between the performance of a cognitive task and a control condition.
  The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind may be flawed and that different mental functions may be more distributed throughout the brain rather than neatly localized in specific regions.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: The most strongly supported statement by the passage is that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. The passage explains the principles behind FMRI, which measures the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain during cognitive tasks compared to a control condition. The reasoning behind the subtractive method of measurement is that whatever remains after the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. The passage also discusses the flawed nature of the modular theory of mind and suggests that different mental functions may be more distributed throughout the brain rather than neatly localized in specific regions.
Response 1:
Knowledge:

The passage also explains how the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) can create a false impression of neat functional localization.
  
A: The passage does not support this statement. Rather, it suggests that the premise of the modular theory of mind is in question, and that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
B: The passage makes no mention of this claim. It is not supported.
C: This statement is supported by the passage, particularly in the discussion of the subtractive method used in FMRI. The differential rate of oxygen use revealed by the subtractive method is used as a measure of metabolic activity, and reflects the areas of the brain that are most active during a specific cognitive task.
D: The passage mentions baseline measurements taken for use in the subtractive method, but it does not support the claim that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. 
E: The passage does not mention this specific scenario. While the passage does discuss the limitations of the subtractive method, it does not mention anger in particular.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging as a research method in psychology. 
  The modular theory of mind is a premise upon which the validity of neuroimaging as a research method depends. 
  The use of the subtractive method in functional magnetic resonance imaging is discussed, which produces images of the brain at work.

A: The passage highlights a critique of the modular theory of mind that it may not be valid to decompose mental activity into independent and localized modules. Therefore, this statement is not supported by the passage. 
B: The passage does not suggest that the modular theory of mind claims inactive brain regions to have a rate of oxygen use which is close to zero. Therefore, this statement is not supported by the passage. 
C: The passage does discuss how functional magnetic resonance imaging produces an image of the differential rate of oxygen use during a cognitive task while controlling for the baseline rate of oxygen use. Therefore, this statement is supported by the passage. 
D: The passage does not explicitly state that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. Therefore, this statement is not supported by the passage.
E: The passage does not discuss the specific cognitive tasks associated with anger or the brain regions "lit up" during such tasks. Therefore, this statement is not supported by the passage.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans (specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging, or FMRI) as a research method in psychology and critiques the premise of the modular theory of mind, which suggests that mental activity can be analyzed into distinct modules located in separate brain regions. The passage notes that some experts suggest that mental activity may be distributed throughout the brain, rather than localized in separate modules.
  
A: The passage actually critiques the modular theory of mind and suggests that mental activity may not be composed of independent modules located in specific regions of the brain. This choice therefore contradicts the main argument of the passage. 
B: The idea that regions of the brain not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero is not discussed in the passage, and there is no evidence to support this idea. 
C: The passage notes that brain areas most metabolically active during certain cognitive tasks will "light up" on an FMRI scan, indicating higher oxygen use. 
D: The passage mentions that baseline measurements taken during the subtractive method show the entire brain as active in both conditions, but it does not support the idea that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
E: The passage does not specifically reference anger, but it does suggest that the subtractive method used in FMRI can reveal regions of the brain that are active during certain cognitive tasks.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and argues against the modular theory of mind, which claims that mental processes are decomposable into independent modules instantiated in localized brain regions.
  FMRI scans measure the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, and the subtractive method is used to produce images of the brain at work.
 
Action: Answer("C")  
According to the passage, during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. This supports choice C. The other choices are either not mentioned in the passage or contradicted by the information presented.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology and compares it to its use in medical diagnosis.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise of the use of neuroimaging in psychology.
  The modular theory of mind proposes that different cognitive modules are instantiated in specific regions of the brain.
  Some critics suggest that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a technique used to investigate brain function in response to various cognitive tasks.
  The FMRI produces an image of the differential rate of oxygen use in response to a cognitive task.
  The subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and task conditions.
  Striking images of the brain at work are produced by the subtractive method.
Action: Answer("C")  
Based on the passage, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is (C): During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and raises questions about the validity of the modular theory of mind, which presupposes that distinct mental processes correspond to specific regions of the brain. The passage notes that the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) produces images that appear to support the modular theory of mind but actually obscure the distributed nature of brain function. 

A: The passage does not make this claim. Although the modular theory of mind is mentioned, the passage casts doubt on its validity and suggests that a more general theory of brain activity may be more accurate.
B: This statement is not supported by the passage. The passage does not describe the rate of oxygen use in the brain in the absence of a specific cognitive task.
C: This is the best answer. The passage describes the subtractive method used in FMRI, which measures the differential rate of oxygen use between the baseline and task conditions. The passage notes that the subtractive method produces images that highlight areas of the brain that are most metabolically active in response to a given cognitive task.
D: Although the passage does discuss baseline measurements of oxygen use, it does not state that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. 
E: While the passage discusses the example of anger, it does not focus on this particular emotion or assert that several regions of the brain "light up" exclusively in response to it. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in studying the mind and criticizes the modular theory of mind, which posits that mental processes are decomposable into independent modules. The passage explains that the brain is an integrated system, and that functional localization is an oversimplification.
  
A: The passage argues against this view of the mind, instead suggesting that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. Therefore, this statement is not strongly supported by the passage.
B: The modular theory of mind is not concerned with a zero rate of oxygen use in regions of the brain that are not engaged in specific cognitive tasks.
C: This statement accurately reflects the passage's explanation of the subtractive method, which produces functional localization images by subtracting out the distributed brain functions, leaving only the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
D: The passage discusses that the entire brain is active in both control and on-task conditions. However, this statement is not strongly supported by the passage.
E: The passage suggests that the view of the mind as composed of independent modules is incorrectly simplified, making it unclear where emotions are processed in the brain. Therefore, it cannot be accurately said that "several regions of the brain are lit up" when a person experiences anger.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage critiques the modular theory of mind and the use of neuroimaging as a research method in psychology.
  FMRI is a subtractive method that produces a map of metabolic activity in response to a cognitive task.
A: The passage critiques the modular theory of mind, arguing that mental activity is likely not decomposable into independent modules and that the whole brain is active during both cognitive task and control conditions. Therefore, statement A is not supported.
B: The modular theory of mind does not specify the rate of oxygen use in regions of the brain not engaged in a specific cognitive task, so statement B is not supported.
C: The passage describes the subtractive method used in FMRI, which produces a map of differential rate of oxygen use during a cognitive task compared to control conditions. Therefore, statement C is the most accurate and is supported by the passage.
D: The passage mentions that baseline measurements are taken in control conditions in FMRI, but it does not imply that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. Therefore, statement D is not supported.
E: The passage discusses the difficulty of localizing specific mental processes and suggests that the entire brain is active during both cognitive task and control conditions. It does not mention the specific brain regions that "light up" during the experience of anger. Therefore, statement E is not supported. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology.
- It explains that the validity of neuroimaging as a research method depends on the premise of the modular theory of mind.
- However, the passage goes on to critique the modular theory of mind, arguing that mental processes are not necessarily decomposable into independent modules.
- The passage explains that brain scans actually depict the differential rate of oxygen use between a control condition and a cognitive task.

A: This statement contradicts the passage's critique of the modular theory of mind and is therefore not supported by the passage.
B: The passage does not mention anything about regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task having a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
C: This statement is supported by the passage, which explains that brain scans reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks, and that the FMRI subtractive method involves comparing the rate of oxygen use in the performing of a cognitive task to the baseline rate.
D: The passage implies the opposite of this statement, explaining that the entire brain is active in both the control condition and the cognitive task condition, and that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
E: This statement is not supported by the passage, which does not mention anything about anger or the different areas of the brain that "light up" in response to it.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage compares the art of oil painting and the art of perfume-making, highlighting the similarities between the two. It argues that perfume-making is a fine art and suggests that it is undervalued due to its association with the cosmetic industry.
A: The passage mentions that great perfumes can stimulate memories, but it does not make a general statement about the ability of art to evoke memories. This choice is too broad.
B: This choice accurately summarizes the comparison the author makes between the art of oil painting and the art of perfume-making.
C: The passage does not support this statement. Although it suggests that some perfume makers prioritize profit over quality, it does not make a sweeping statement about the nature of art that would imply that the commercial success of a work dooms it to failure.
D: The passage does not provide evidence to support this statement.
E: The passage does not argue that one form of art is superior to another. Instead, it highlights the similarities between oil painting and perfume-making, two arts that are not usually considered together.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume in terms of their use of natural and synthetic chemical compounds to create a sensory experience.
  The passage argues that perfumes are undervalued because they are produced by corporations that prioritize profits over quality.
A: The passage mentions that perfumers are "calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience," suggesting that memories can be evoked by a work of art, but this is not the central point of the passage.
B: The passage describes how perfumers combine olfactory elements to create many small sensations, much like a painter combines colors to create an image, supporting this choice.
C: While the passage criticizes corporations for prioritizing profit over quality, it does not state that commercial success is incompatible with creating a successful work of art.
D: The passage mentions that oil paintings become gradually more transparent over time, but does not make a general statement about the improvement of works of art with age.
E: The passage does not make a value judgment about whether one form of art is superior to another.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between oil painting and perfume-making, and suggests that perfumers and artists are in the same business of creating an aesthetic experience. The passage also discusses the undervaluation of perfumes due to the influence of corporations.
A: The passage mentions that both painters and perfumers can create illusions that bring about memories or touch long-forgotten experiences, but it does not provide support for the claim that memories are necessary for an aesthetic experience in art in general.
B: The passage suggests that perfumers create many small sensations through the configuration of olfactory elements, but it does not provide support for the claim that this is true for any work of art.
C: The passage criticizes corporations for tampering with old perfume formulas, making it difficult for fine perfume to stand apart from the international cosmetic dollar, but it does not provide support for the claim that a work of art created for commercial success will inevitably fail.
D: The passage mentions that oil paintings change over time due to the drying and becoming more transparent of the oil paint, but it does not provide support for the claim that the best works of art improve with age.
E: The passage does not provide support for the claim that some forms of art are superior to others.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the art of smell and compares it to the art of painting, emphasizing similarities in the creative process.
  The passage points out that some perfumes are undervalued because they are often made for the sake of commercial success and profit instead of the quality of the work.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfumery, noting that both involve the combination of natural and synthetic elements to create an aesthetic experience. The author argues that great perfumes are undervalued due to corporate control and the lack of serious attention paid to perfumery by art professionals. The passage does not explicitly discuss the superiority of any particular art form over others, nor does it suggest that commercial success necessarily detracts from the artistic quality of a work.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the art of perfume, drawing parallels between it and the more commonly known visual arts, such as painting. It also touches on issues related to the perfume industry's use of cheap chemical compounds and resultant disregard for the craft of perfumery. 

The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: The passage suggests that perfumes, like other forms of art, can bring about an aesthetic experience by evoking memories. This is most strongly supported by the following statement in the passage: "A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas." Choice A summarizes this idea most accurately. All other options either misrepresent what the passage is arguing or take a position that is not advocated for in the passage.
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the similarities between the art of perfume-making and the art of painting. It suggests that a talented perfumer can create an imaginary world through the skillful combination of olfactory elements in the same way that a painter can create an illusion of life on canvas.

A: The passage does mention that perfumers can "call on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience," which suggests that a work of art can evoke memories. However, this is not the main focus of the passage, and it does not suggest that this is a necessary quality of all works of art, so this is not the best answer.

B: This statement is supported by the passage. The passage compares the work of perfumers to that of painters, noting that they both combine small elements in a harmonious way to create a larger experience.

C: The passage does not make this claim. While it notes the negative effects that commercial interests can have on perfume-making, it does not suggest that this applies to all works of art.

D: There is no support for this claim in the passage. While the passage does note that oil paintings change appearance over time, it does not suggest that they improve with age. The passage focuses more on the process of creating both paintings and perfumes.

E: The passage does not make any claims about the relative superiority of different forms of art.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage compares the art of painting to the art of perfume-making, highlighting their similarities in the use of natural and synthetic elements to create complex configurations that evoke a range of sensations and emotions. The author also notes that unlike painting and other arts, perfume-making is undervalued and poorly served by marketing and public relations, resulting in the substitution of cheap ingredients for rarer ingredients in some commercial perfumes. 

Action: Answer("A") 
The passage provides the most support for the statement that "A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes." The author notes that perfumes can evoke memories and experiences in the same way that paintings do, and considers this an important aspect of the art of perfume-making. While other choices may be tangentially related to the ideas in the passage, they are not directly supported by the passage itself.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between the art of painting and the creation of perfume, and argues that great perfumes are undervalued today because they are made and distributed by corporations that tamper with old formulas in an effort to increase profits.
  A: The passage mentions that perfumes can evoke memories, but it does not provide the most support for this statement about art.
  B: The passage describes the complex configurations of olfactory elements that perfumers experiment with and the symphonic combinations of small sensations that result, which provides support for this statement about art.
  C: The passage does not provide support for this statement about art; it focuses on the undervaluing of great perfumes due to corporate manipulation.
  D: The passage does not provide support for this statement about art; it focuses on the undervaluing of great perfumes due to corporate manipulation.
  E: The passage does not provide support for this statement about art; it instead argues for the value of exploring the art of perfume.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the parallels between the art of painting and the art of perfumery, and argues that perfumery is undervalued in the art world, possibly due to commercial considerations.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how scientists have discovered a new class of protein pathogens, called prions, that are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. Prions possess the unique ability to convert normal proteins in the body into their pathogenic form, initiating a chain reaction. This leads to the accumulation of thread-like structures in the brain that destroy nerve cells and result in fatal degenerative neurological conditions like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Although initially met with skepticism, subsequent research has supported the idea that prions are a new class of infectious pathogens. It is speculated that malformation of proteins in this way may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, but this hypothesis is still being studied.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The main point of this passage is that research into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has led to the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen that is able to reproduce itself without genetic material. The passage provides information on the symptoms and effects of CJD, the role of prions in causing the disease, and how prions are different from other pathogens. While the passage also mentions the potential connection between prions and other degenerative neurological conditions, this does not fully capture the main focus of the passage, which is primarily concerned with prions and their role in CJD. Therefore, the best choice is B.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage discusses the discovery of the pathogenic agent that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which was found to be a disease agent called "prion". The prion is a class of protein pathogens that can reproduce themselves in an unexpected way without genetic material, and which can transform their structure into a dangerous abnormal shape capable of destroying nerve cells, thus leading to death. The discovery of prions was initially met with skepticism, but subsequent research supports the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens responsible not only for CJD but also for other degenerative neurological conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a class of protein pathogens that can reproduce themselves uniquely without genetic material. The best answer is B.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of a new type of pathogen called prions that is different from other pathogens that contain nucleic acid in their cellular structure.
  Prions reproduce and cause cellular destruction without the need for any genetic material.
  Prions were discovered in the process of identifying the pathogen responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  The discovery of prions has challenged the assumption that all pathogens contain nucleic acid in their cellular structure and has implications for our understanding of other neurological conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage is mainly about the discovery of prions as a new type of protein pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. The passage provides information on what prions are capable of doing in the body, how they reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction, and the wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and progression of the disease. Therefore, out of all the options, the best answer is B: "Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material."
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The passage discusses the discovery of "prions," a class of protein pathogens responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, which are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. Therefore, (B) accurately expresses the main point of the passage. While the passage also mentions other aspects related to prions, the main focus is on their discovery and the implications for understanding the nature of pathogens.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The passage discusses a new type of protein pathogen discovered by scientists - referred to as prions- which is responsible for causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. The pathogen lacks nucleic acid and only consists mainly of protein. Prions have infectious properties and can reproduce themselves without genetic material, leading to the destruction of nerve cells in the brain. The passage therefore argues that the research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a new class of protein pathogens that are uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. This is captured in option B, making it the correct answer.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The main point of the passage is that researchers investigating the cause of CJD have discovered a new kind of protein pathogen, called prions, which is capable of reproducing itself without genetic material, and that this discovery has challenged the conventional view of pathogens. Option A is incorrect because the mechanism of protein reproduction is not the focus of the passage, and the statement that most organisms produce several kinds of proteins is misleading. Option C goes beyond the scope of the passage: while the possibility is raised that prions could be involved in other neurological conditions, this idea is still hypothetical and has not been supported by research. Option D is wrong because the passage describes how skepticism was initially overcome as more evidence was gathered to support the prion hypothesis. Option E is partially correct, but does not capture the fact that the discovery of prions as a new type of pathogen is tied to the investigation of CJD.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of protein-based agent called "prions" that can cause diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Unlike other pathogens, prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce themselves by inducing normally-shaped prions to transform into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  
A: This answer choice is incorrect because it describes the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves in detail, but it does not accurately express the main point of the passage.
B: This answer choice accurately expresses the main point of the passage by discussing how research into the cause of CJD has led to the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogens that can reproduce themselves without genetic material.
C: This answer choice is incorrect because the passage only mentions the possibility that prions may be responsible for other degenerative neurological conditions, but it emphasizes the link between prions and CJD.
D: This answer choice is incorrect because it describes a fact about the scientific community's initial reaction to the discovery of prions causing CJD, but it does not accurately express the main point of the passage.
E: This answer choice accurately expresses the main point of the passage by stating that prions can reproduce themselves without genetic material and can cause CJD. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The passage is largely discussing the discovery of prions and how they differ from other types of pathogens. The main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has led to the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen, known as prions, which is capable of reproducing itself without genetic material. Therefore, the most accurate choice is B. The other options may contain some information from the passage, but they do not accurately convey the main point of the passage as well as choice B.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use
  D: detectable using brain scans enhanced by means of the subtractive method
  E: features of a general mental activity that is spread throughout the brain

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains how the view of neuroscientists changes the way we think about law. It suggests that people might not make free and rational choices, and the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms. 
  Passage B argues that people can still act freely even in a deterministic world, depending on whether their actions are constrained or not. Ayer distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions, which are caused by internal and external sources respectively. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Both passages discuss the relationship between neuroscience and the law, and argue that the concept of moral responsibility needs to be reevaluated in light of new scientific insights.
  Passage A argues that free choice may be an illusion, and that we should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing people for their immoral acts.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism, and that actions can be free as long as they are caused by internal, rather than external, sources. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience challenge the law's focus on retribution for freely chosen immoral acts, and instead suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms. 
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism, and distinguishes between free actions (caused by internal sources) and constrained actions (caused by external sources).
  A: mental disorder is discussed in passage B as an example of a cause of constrained actions, but it is not mentioned in passage A.
  B: free choice is discussed in both passages as a concept that is respectively challenged (A) and defended with nuance (B).
  C: causality is discussed in both passages, with determinism being the subject of passage B and with neuroscience furthering our understanding of causality in passage A.
  D: self-delusion is discussed in passage A as a possibility suggested by neuroscience, but it is not mentioned in passage B.
  E: moral responsibility is discussed in passage A as a concept that should be replaced by a focus on deterring future harms, but it is not mentioned in passage B.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that people may not be making a free and rational moral choice even though they believe they are. It suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution and focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will, and are not constrained. Actions that are caused by external sources are constrained.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that neuroscience suggests that the focus of criminal law should be on preventing future harms instead of retribution, as people's "free" rational choices may be influenced by uncontrollable factors.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will in the context of determinism and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions based on internal and external sources of causation.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Both passages discuss neuroscience and its impact on the law.
  Passage A argues for deterrence over retribution in the law.
  Passage A argues that a person's actions may be outside of their control due to brain activity.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it relates to determinism.
  Ayer's theory distinguishes between free and constrained actions based on the source of the cause, not just the presence of a cause.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that all that matters is whether someone's behavior is rational. It suggests that people may be deluding themselves into thinking they are making free and rational choices when their choices may be influenced by emotional centers of the brain. According to Passage A, the law should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution based on moral responsibility.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism. It distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions, and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. The passage suggests that actions and wills that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained and therefore free.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  Mental disorder is a concept that is discussed in Passage B but not in Passage A. Passage B mentions mental disorders such as kleptomania as an example of external sources that constrain actions. In contrast, Passage A suggests that even though people may believe they are making free and rational choices, brain scans might reveal that their choices are actually being influenced by emotional centers of the brain.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that people's behavior is caused by the operations of their brain, suggesting that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions. Ayer argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that all behaviors are caused by the operations of the brain and that people may delude themselves into believing that they make free and rational moral choices even though their choices may be influenced by emotional centers in the brain. The passage suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism. Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources that force someone to perform a particular action.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that people's behavior is caused by their brain and that people may not have free will as they believe. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and how it can coexist with determinism. It distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions, arguing that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: According to the passage, which one of the following was true of the physics community during the 1930s?
Choices:
  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: It reevaluated caleulations indicating that atoms could be split
  C: It never identified the by-products ofneutron bombardment ofuraniwn.

  A: The passage does not specifically state that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: The passage does not suggest that the physics community reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
  C: The passage discusses that the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium were compiled and increasing evidence was documented about nuclear fission, eventually leading to the discovery of nuclear fission by Meitner.
  D: The passage does not suggest that uranium atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: The passage mentions the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but it does not suggest that the physics community recognized these dangers.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The physicists in the 1930s were trying to split atoms.
  They were bombarding uranium with neutrons.
  Lise Meitner discovered that they were actually splitting the atoms.
  Otto Hahn sent Meitner a letter detailing the identification of Barium as a result of the experiments happened.
  Meitner concluded that they had split the uranium atoms.
  Meitner and Otto Frisch coined the term "nuclear fission".
  
A) is incorrect because the text states that the theoretical developments were overlooked; there is no mention of them being neglected.
D) is incorrect because nowhere in the text is it stated that the physicists knew which atoms were easiest to split.
E) is incorrect because the text does not focus on the dangers of working with radioactive substances. It does mention it briefly, but it is not the main focus of the passage.
B) is incorrect because there is no recollection of any specific instance in which the community reevaluated their assumptions.
C) is incorrect because it was mentioned that scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved and the by-products of neutron bombardment of Uranium was unknown. It was only due to the expectation that the by-products would be close to Uranium in nuclear composition that their findings remained unidentified.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The discovery of nuclear fission took several years to complete and was accomplished in a series of experiments by researchers from various countries.
  A: The passage does not mention neglect of earlier theoretical developments by the physics community during the 1930s.
  B: Theoretical physicists produced calculations indicating that atoms could be split before the experiments with neutron bombardment that ultimately led to the discovery of nuclear fission. After these experiments, Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection between the experimental data and the theoretical calculations.
  C: The physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved and identified a variety of by-products of the reactions that they observed. These by-products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.

  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, primarily through neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Enrico Fermi and a group of Italian physicists conducted early experiments on this topic.
  Lise Meitner made the crucial theoretical connection that led to the recognition of nuclear fission.
A: The passage does not provide information to support this statement. It does not mention neglect of earlier theoretical developments or give any indication that this was a significant problem in the physics community.
B: The passage does not specifically mention reevaluation of calculations indicating that atoms could be split. It does describe some early theoretical work indicating that atomic nuclei could potentially be split, but it does not indicate that these calculations were reevaluated.
C: This statement is incorrect. The passage describes the production of puzzling radioactive substances resulting from neutron bombardment of uranium, and researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved before recognizing what they were witnessing. The matter of identifying the by-products of nuclear fission is discussed at length in the passage.
D: While the passage does not specifically address the relative ease of splitting uranium atoms versus atoms of other elements, it does describe the researchers' focus on neutron bombardment of uranium specifically, suggesting that there was some reason to believe that uranium was a promising substance to experiment with for this purpose.
E: While the passage does describe the dangers of working with highly radioactive substances, it does not specifically indicate whether the physics community recognized these dangers at the time.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a major discovery in nuclear physics chemistry, the realization that atoms can be split, and how it was achieved through a series of experiments over several years.
  The article explains that although there was a lot of evidence gathered beforehand, researchers did not realize what they had witnessed until the crucial theoretical linkage was provided by Lise Meitner.
  According to the passage, "the relevant evidence" is what the researchers should have realized they were achieving all along, which Meitner recognized from the data.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage talks about the process of discovering nuclear fission and how scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 to 1939, without recognizing what they were witnessing. In 1939, Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection to the experiments. She recognized that researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
A: The author refers to the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939. This is the evidence that the researchers operated on but did not recognize.
B: This refers to a subset of the experiments conducted by Lise Meitner in 1938.
C: Hahn's finding that one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium is a key piece of evidence that is referred to by the author, but the evidence being talked about is broader, encompassing over five years of experimentation.
D: This refers to a part of Hahn's finding related to the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, but is not the main evidence being talked about by the author.
E: The unanswered question of which radioactive substances are being produced is a prelude to what the author refers to as the "relevant evidence".
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author is referring to evidence that was present but unrecognized by scientists until Lise Meitner realized they had actually been splitting uranium atoms, thus discovering nuclear fission.
  A: This is partially correct, but the author is not referring to all of the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium by the physics community. The author is only referring to the evidence that was relevant to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  B: This is incorrect, as the author is not referring to the results of Meitner's experiments alone, but to the evidence that was present but unrecognized by scientists at the time.
  C: This is partially correct, but the author is not only referring to the clear chemical evidence found by Hahn, but to the overall evidence that was unrecognized until Meitner made the conceptual link to nuclear fission.
  D: This is partially correct, as the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus is relevant evidence, but it is not the only evidence referred to by the author.
  E: This is incorrect, as the author is not concerned with the reasons why the radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for some time.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author explains how the discovery of fission was achieved after accumulating evidence from various experiments and how this evidence was not recognized as significant until the right conceptual link was made.
  The correct answer choice should identify what evidence finally led to the conclusion that uranium atoms were being split. 
  A and B are incorrect because the evidence was not limited to experiments conducted between 1934 and 1939 nor to experiments conducted by Meitner in 1938.
  C is only a part of the evidence that ultimately led to the conclusion of uranium atoms being split, though significant and noted within the text.
  D is also only a part of the evidence, though significant and noted within the text.
  E is not the evidence that ultimately led to the conclusion of uranium atoms being split.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the discovery of nuclear fission in the 1930s, including experiments conducted by Italian and Austrian physicists and related research conducted by Lise Meitner.
  In 1938, one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium.
  Otto Hahn noted that despite the clear chemical evidence, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics."
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and was the first to suggest that they were splitting uranium atoms.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, and describes the experimental evidence that was available prior to the theoretical breakthrough. It emphasizes that the evidence was present, but that the correct conceptual link was lacking.
  A: Option A describes the general experiments that scientists conducted and found evidence of nuclear fission, but it is not what the author refers to as "the relevant evidence" that lacks the right conceptual link. It is only the background for the discovery of nuclear fission.
  B: Option B describes the research that Meitner conducted in 1938, which was related to that of the Italians. While Meitner's research provided some evidence, it was not what the author refers to as "the relevant evidence" that lacks the right conceptual link.
  C: Option C refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn discovered of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, and the fact that its structure would have made it impossible to produce it through any mechanism. This evidence helped Meitner recognize the significance of the data, but it is not what the author refers to as "the relevant evidence" that lacks the right conceptual link.
  D: Option D mentions the fact that the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus. However, this fact alone is not what the author refers to as "the relevant evidence" that lacks the right conceptual link.
  E: Option E mentions that the radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for some time due to the difficulties in precise chemical analyses and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials. While this difficulty may have delayed the discovery of nuclear fission, it is not what the author refers to as "the relevant evidence" that lacks the right conceptual link.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author is discussing the discovery of nuclear fission and the various evidence that led up to it.
  A: This is the evidence leading up to nuclear fission and is too broad to be the "relevant evidence" the author refers to in line 62.
  B: This is research done by Meitner and is too narrow to be the "relevant evidence" the author refers to in line 62.
  C: While this evidence is mentioned in the passage, it is too narrow to be the "relevant evidence" the author refers to in line 62.
  D: This evidence is mentioned in the passage and is related to the discovery of nuclear fission and the "relevant evidence" the author refers to in line 62.
  E: This is irrelevant to the discovery of nuclear fission and the "relevant evidence" the author refers to in line 62.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which was achieved by neutron bombardment of uranium. Researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939 but were unable to recognize it, until Lise Meitner realized the significance of the data and coined the term "nuclear fission". The "relevant evidence" mentioned in the passage refers to the data that Meitner finally recognized in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, namely, that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
A: This choice refers to the neutron bombardment experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which provided increasing evidence of nuclear fission. This evidence is related to the "relevant evidence," but it is not equivalent to it.
B: This choice refers to Meitner's research on the radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. While Meitner's research helped her recognize the significance of the data, it does not refer to the "relevant evidence" itself.
C: This choice refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. This evidence supported Meitner's conclusion that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms, and it is related to the "relevant evidence," but it is not equivalent to it.
D: This choice refers to the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus. This fact supported Hahn's conclusion that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms, and it is related to the "relevant evidence," but it is not equivalent to it.
E: This choice refers to the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for some time. While this fact is mentioned in the passage, it is not related to the "relevant evidence" that Meitner recognized.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The relevant evidence that the author is referring to is what allowed researchers to understand that uranium atoms were being split and resulted in the coining of the term "nuclear fission".
  A: This choice refers to the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission and is a reasonably accurate representation of what the author is referring to.
  B: While Meitner did conduct related research, the relevant evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission was not limited to her work alone, and was present in the experimental results of many scientists.
  C: While the clear chemical evidence found by Hahn was a crucial piece of evidence and helped corroborate the discovery of nuclear fission, it was not the only evidence that led scientists to understand what was happening.
  D: This choice describes part of the evidence that Hahn found, but it alone would not have been enough to lead to the understanding of the phenomenon of nuclear fission.
  E: This choice describes a fact that is mentioned in the passage, but is not the relevant evidence that the author is referring to.
Action: Answer ("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses how scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939, but did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  Otto Hahn wrote to Meitner of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium was conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.

Action: Answer("D") 
If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, this would be in line with his own work, which tends to skew towards a less emotional and more parody-like tone. Therefore, if this were true, it could challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as an artist who displayed an impulse toward realism and conveyed a seriousness of theme that transcended mere parody. However, the passage does not mention anything about Lichtenstein criticizing other pop artists for producing emotional paintings, so this option cannot be chosen as the answer.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should allow people to act on certain inside information to ensure that all relevant information about a company is reflected in the stock prices and that the law should permit people to sell/buy stocks based on inside information that could affect the stock's value. It emphasizes the importance of widely spreading accurate information and argues that a ban on all insider trading would undermine these goals.
  Passage B argues against insider trading, claiming that it goes against the basic principle of transparency in the stock market. It states insider trading is unfair to others who don't have access to the same information, that it undermines investor confidence, and ultimately could destroy the market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading is not always detrimental to the stock market, and can sometimes help spread accurate information about a company's value.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading is fundamentally unfair and undermines investor confidence in the stock market.
  A: The law described in A would prohibit insider-trading entirely, whereas the author of passage A argues that insider-trading can sometimes be helpful to the stock market.
  B: The law described in B would permit trading based on analysis of a stock, but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position in a company; this is consistent with the author of passage A's position.
  C: The law described in C would prohibit any trading that could undermine investor confidence in the stock market, which is consistent with the author of passage B's position.
  D: The law described in D legalizes selling based on certain types of inside information, which is consistent with the author of passage A's position, but it does not permit trading based on information obtained "from one's special position within a company," as the question asks. So, D is not the best answer.
  E: The law described in E would legalize insider trading entirely, which is not consistent with either author's position.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The author of Passage A supports the idea that allowing those with accurate information about a company to act helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. Accordingly, it also claims that insider nontrading, the practice of not making a stock sale or purchase due to having inside knowledge of the stock, is certainly happening every day and should not be criminalized.
  The author of Passage B claims that stock markets work best when information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time and success is based on an individual's merit and skill. It also explains that insider-trading unfairly compromises the market by providing some people with information that others don't have and thus allows them to make informed trade decisions far before everyone else.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The author of Passage A supports the idea that insider trading law may be too strict and may limit the ability of the stock market to fairly represent all available information.
  The author of Passage B believes that insider trading undermines the transparency of the market, causing investor confidence to suffer and ultimately damaging the entire market.
  A: This law would ensure that all trading was based on information that is available to everyone, and conforms closely to the position in Passage A that spreads knowledge as widely and quickly as possible.
  B: This law permits analysis of a stock but doesn't account for insider information gained from one's position within a company, so it partially aligns with author of Passage A, but still supports restrictions on some types of insider trading.
  C: This law prohibits trading that could undermine investor confidence, which is discussed briefly in Passage A but is the central focus of Passage B.
  D: This law legalizes some selling and prohibits some buying based on inside information, and does not align closely with either position presented in the passages.
  E: This law legalizes trading based on inside information, but Passage A only supports trading based on information that is widely available. Passage B takes a strong stance against insider trading, making this option unlikely.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The author of passage A argues that insider-trading law should not be so broad as to include trading based on information that is not private, while the author of passage B argues that such laws are necessary to maintain market fairness and investor confidence.
  
Analysis:
  Passage A suggests that insider-trading laws are necessary to prevent unfair trading based on non-public, private information that is not available to everyone. However, trading based on information that is available publicly or that is obtained through research is part of the functioning of the stock market and should be legal. On the other hand, Passage B advocates for a transparent market, where everyone has equal access to information, and insider-trading laws should prohibit trading based on non-public information to maintain market fairness and investor confidence. Therefore, the answer is B, which permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Response 5:
Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information available about a company is spread as widely as possible, although insider trading is illegal, while Passage B argues that insider trading is unfair because it undermines investor confidence in the stock market. So, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of Passage A would be one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - The author of Passage A argues that stock markets work best when accurate information is spread widely and rapidly. In insider-trading situations, people with inside information have an unfair advantage over those without it and undermine the transparency of the market. 
  - The author of Passage B argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market. Information that influences trading decisions should be available to all at the same time. Insider trading can compromise the market and destroy investor confidence, denying companies the funds they need to grow and be successful. 
Action: Answer("B") because it permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, which the author of passage A argues is not insider trading and should be allowed, but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which the author of passage A suggests is insider trading and should be prohibited.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that stock markets are based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit, and that it helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. It also argues that the law should not criminalize 'insider nontrading'.
  Passage B argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market, and that insider trading undermines investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author of passage A argues that insider-trading law should allow traders to act on accurate information to ensure stock prices reflect an accurate assessment of all the relevant facts, and considers insider nontrading to be a widespread practice that is not penalized.
  The author of passage B argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the market by giving some traders an unfair advantage, undermining investor competence, and ultimately destroying the market. The author believes that a transparent market is critical so that investors can make informed decisions based on the same information.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law, as it is currently defined, could inhibit the spread of accurate information and ultimately be counterproductive. It suggests that selling stocks based on inside information could be beneficial and helpful, as those actions help ensure accurate assessments in the market.

  Passage B argues from a different perspective. It suggests that insider-trading is unfair and illegal, as it allows a select few to gain information not available to everyone, giving them an unfair advantage. The passage suggests that it is important for the market to be transparent to engender investor confidence. 

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Passage A's argument is that it is not insider trading itself that is necessarily wrong, but the fact that it involves the use of information that is not available to everyone, thereby distorting the transparency of the market. This argument would be most consistent with a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, as this would allow for the market to remain transparent while still permitting people to make informed investment decisions.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the history of two theories regarding the transmission of electrical impulses between neurons in the brain. The older electrical signal theory viewed communication between neurons as happening from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons) via electrical impulses. The newer chemical signal theory posits that communication occurs via the secretion of chemicals called neurotransmitters, that bind with their corresponding receptor molecules in the receiving neuron, rendering it permeable to ions that then generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell, thus transmitting the electrical impulse to the receiving neuron.

Action: Answer("D") 
The argument presented in the passage suggests that electrical impulses are communicated between neurons chemically, rather than electrically. The mechanism by which this happens involved the secretion of chemicals called neurotransmitters, that bind with their corresponding receptor molecules in the receiving neuron, rendering it permeable to ions that then generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell, thus transmitting the electrical impulse to the receiving neuron. The passage then goes on to make the point that each receptor molecule for these neurotransmitters might vary subtly across different parts of the brain, and that these differences could be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs designed to target specific receptors selectively. Choice D precisely captures the main point of the passage.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two theories about how communication between neurons occurs: an early one involving electrical impulses, and a later one involving chemicals called neurotransmitters that bind to receptor molecules in receiving neurons. According to the newer theory, the binding of neurotransmitters to receptors causes them to change shape and open channels through which ions can enter the receiving neuron. This electrical activity constitutes the transmission of information between the neurons. Another important point is that receptor molecules come in several varieties, and that these differences can be exploited to treat brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

Analysis:
  The answer must accurately reflect the main point of the passage.
  A is incorrect because it inaccurately suggests that evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided "not by electrical signals" at all.
  B is incorrect because although it is generally true that enough similarities exist between some of the chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family, this is not the main point of the passage.
  C is not an accurate statement of the main point of the passage because it misses the emphasis on the new information about the importance of the structure of receptors in the mediation of chemical signals, as well as the potential therapeutic applications of this knowledge.
  D accurately summarizes the main point of the passage because it emphasizes the two central themes: the nature of chemical transmission of information between neurons, and the therapeutic potential of that knowledge.
  E is incorrect because it puts too much emphasis on receptor molecule variability, and does not capture the emphasis on the process of chemical transmission and its therapeutic possibilities. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")

The main point of the passage is that:
  - Neurotransmitters mediate the transmission of electrical impulses between neurons
  - The structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity
  - Separate regions of receptors function as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the opening of its channel component
  - Receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions
  - Subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders

Answer choice D most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")

The passage discusses two theories about the transmission of impulses between neurons, one suggesting that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons and the other for transmission of impulses through neurotransmitters. It then talks about previous skepticism about the latter theory, but recent evidence has confirmed that neurotransmitters govern the brain's function by acting on receptors in a chemical, not electrical way, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders. Therefore, Choice D, "Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders." most accurately summarizes the main point of the passage.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about the workings of the brain cells mediated not by electrical signals, but by chemicals called neurotransmitters, and how the receptors for these neurotransmitters have a structure of binding sites and channels for ions. Medical significance lies in how this structure could be exploited to design selective drugs for certain brain disorders.
  
  A: The statement accurately mentions that the workings of the brain are guided by chemicals rather than electrical signals, and that subtle differences among receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders. This statement's extent of accuracy is higher than the other choices.
  B: The statement accurately mentions that chemicals guiding the workings of the brain have enough similarities to be classified into a family. However, the second part of the statement is incomplete and misleading implying that the classification of these chemicals into a family has significance.
  C: The statement accurately mentions that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, but only partly accurate as it ignores the structural component of receptor molecules that play a pivotal role.
  D: The statement combines the elements of statement A and statement C, however, does not accurately convey the information on receptors' structure that plays a pivotal role in the transmission of electrical impulses.  
  E: The statement accurately mentions the existence of subtle differences among receptor molecules in different parts of the brain and how these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through selective drugs. However, it is incomplete and misguided as it does not highlight the role of neurotransmitters or the structure of receptor molecules.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The main point of the passage is the theory of how neurotransmitters work in the brain.
  The passage explains that some neurobiologists once believed communication between neurons in the brain happened solely through electrical impulses, but that alternative theories suggested that neurotransmitters bind to their corresponding receptor molecules in the receiving neuron and create an electrical impulse that runs through the cell.
  The passage discusses the structure of receptors and evidence showing that they play a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The passage also explains that different parts of the brain have different receptors, which makes it possible to selectively target and treat certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how neurobiologists used to think that communication between neurons was exclusively electrical, but a theory emerged suggesting that it was chemical. It was initially unclear how neurotransmitters could make a neuron permeable to ions, but recent research has shown that the structure of receptors plays a key role in this process. Receptors for neurotransmitters contain a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions. When the neurotransmitter attaches to the binding site, it causes the receptor to change shape, which results in the opening of its channel component. Certain neurotransmitter-gated ion channels have been identified, and each of these receptors comes in several varieties that can be targeted with drugs to selectively impede or enhance their effects. 
Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes the contradiction between the Pin Factory, which demonstrates the increasing returns to scale when workers specialize in specific tasks, and the Invisible Hand, which depends on the assumption of diminishing returns to keep markets competitive. The passage further explains that economists had difficulty modeling the Pin Factory with the rigor of mathematics, and this led to the assumption of diminishing returns dominating economic theory. The passage concludes that only recently have economists been able to bring the Pin Factory and increasing returns to the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the best answer choice is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory. The Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand represents the harnessing of self-interest to serve the common good. The issue is that, given increasing returns to scale, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, which can lead to market monopolies and the undermining of the Invisible Hand's effectiveness. This contradiction was de-emphasized for almost two centuries in economic thought, primarily because the economics of diminishing returns could be described with mathematical rigor, whereas those of increasing returns could not. The passage thus argues that economists until recently have failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Therefore, the best answer is E.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes a contradiction between two concepts in economic theory that have historically been at odds with each other. The first concept, represented by the pin factory, emphasizes increasing returns to scale and efficiency gains through specialization of labor. The second concept, represented by the Invisible Hand, emphasizes the ability of a market economy to harness self-interest and lead to a common good. However, the Invisible Hand is dependent on many competitors in each industry, while increasing returns to scale tend to drive smaller firms out of business and lead to monopoly power. For a long time, economists failed to account for the increasing returns to scale, but recent developments in mathematics have led to a greater understanding of this concept. Answer E best expresses the main point of the passage.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: The passage is mostly about two conflicting concepts in economic theory: the efficiency gains from increasing returns to scale (the Pin Factory) and the role of competition in properly functioning markets (the Invisible Hand). The Pin Factory is not well-understood mathematically, which kept it from being fully integrated into economic theory for a long time, but recent developments have changed this. The passage does not primarily dwell on Adam Smith's insights, nor does it make a normative claim about the assumptions of mainstream economics, but it does suggest that economists have been relatively slow to fully incorporate the Pin Factory concept. Choice (E) thus most accurately reflects the main point of the passage.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")

The main point of the passage is that until the late 1970s, mainstream economists had failed to account for the increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries, such as railroads. The passage contrasts the parable of the pin factory, which emphasizes the benefits of increased efficiency through specialization and size, with the idea of the Invisible Hand, which posits that self-interest can lead to the common good in a market economy. The passage argues that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries because it was easier to represent mathematically, but recent developments in mathematics have enabled economists to model increasing returns more rigorously. Therefore, the most accurate choice is option E.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

After providing the background on the economic theories related to Pin Factory and Invisible Hand, the passage concludes by stating that until recently, economists have failed to account for the increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries. This supports the main point of the passage, that there was a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, and the recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand. Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage discusses the struggle between the Pin Factory and the invisible hand in economic theory since Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations. The passage argues that only in recent years have mainstream economists started to account for increasing returns to scale and the role of the Pin Factory in economic thought. Therefore, the best answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage describes a historical development in economic thought related to the struggle between two concepts: the pin factory (emphasizing the efficiency gains from increasing returns to scale) and the invisible hand (describing how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good). According to the passage, the assumption of diminishing returns has dominated economic theory for almost two centuries due to the greater ease of mathematically representing this concept. However, the passage argues that many industries actually exhibit increasing returns to scale, which can lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly power and the need for many market competitors to ensure the proper functioning of the invisible hand. The passage explains that only since the late 1970s have economists found ways to represent the increasing returns of the pin factory with the rigor needed to bring this idea into the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the most accurate main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. Thus, the correct answer is E.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("E")

The main point of the passage is that for almost two centuries, economists believed in the concept of diminishing returns to scale and failed to account for the increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries. The passage describes the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand and explains how increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which is in opposition to the idea of many competitors in a market necessary for the invisible hand to work properly. Only in recent decades has economics accepted increasing returns, and now it is possible to model the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable. Therefore, the most accurate statement of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries, and they failed to do so because of the difficulty in representing this concept mathematically. So, the answer is E, Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("E")

The passage provides information about the contradiction between two economic concepts of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The Pin Factory implies increasing returns to scale while the Invisible Hand implies diminishing returns to scale. There is a tension between these two ideas, particularly because larger businesses tend to drive smaller ones out of the market, making it difficult for the invisible hand to work properly. Until recently, the increasing returns to scale were ignored or excluded in economic theory due to the difficulty of modeling them mathematically. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North in the United States.
  It highlights the factors that caused the Great Migration and explains why it continued over several decades.
  The passage suggests that the Great Migration developed momentum over time as earlier migrants reduced the difficulties and costs of migration for later migrants.
  The earlier migrants provided information about labor and housing conditions, shared temporary housing and credit, and offered a cultural cushion for later migrants.
  The passage argues that while the Great Migration was initially triggered by income differences between the North and South, it was sustained by other factors as well: physical proximity of African American communities in the South and North, feedback mechanisms of information transmission, and the cumulative effects of migration.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")  
Knowledge:
The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern US to the industrial North between 1915 and 1960 and its catalysts. However, the main point of the passage is to explain how earlier migrants reduced the costs of migration for later migrants, both financially and socially/culturally. This explanation covers a significant portion of the passage, as it is clear that the continuation and acceleration of migration was due to the momentum generated by earlier migrants. This point is supported by a discussion of the different ways in which earlier migrants helped later migrants become accustomed to new environments and defray the costs of moving. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")  
Knowledge: 
The passage explains the reasons why African American migration to the North continued and even accelerated in the subsequent decades after the onset of the Great Migration in 1915. It argues that once migration started, it developed momentum over time as current migration helped to reduce the difficulty and costs of future migration. Previous migrants helped defray the costs of later migrants by providing them with information about labor- and housing-market conditions, temporary housing, food, credit, and even a cultural cushion. 
A: Although this statement provides some background information about the Great Migration, it does not accurately express the main point of the passage. 
B: This statement explains some of the catalysts of the Great Migration, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is about the factors that led the migration to continue and accelerate in the subsequent decades. 
C: While this statement explains the role of earlier migrants in reducing migration costs for later migrants, it does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is about the factors that led the migration to continue and accelerate over time. 
D: This statement most accurately expresses the main point of the passage. It argues that in migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants, which helps to explain why African American migration to the North continued and even accelerated over several decades. 
E: This statement provides additional information about the Great Migration, but it does not accurately express the main point of the passage, which is about the role of earlier migrants in sustaining the migration over time.

Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation:
All of the answer choices are supported by the information in the passage, but only (D) accurately expresses the main point of the passage. The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960 and the factors that contributed to its duration over several decades. The main point of the passage is that when people migrate, earlier migrants reduce the physical and cultural costs of moving for later migrants.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The passage is discussing the reasons why migration tends to continue or accelerate once it begins, and how early migrants can help reduce the difficulty and cost of future migration for later migrants. The author uses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North during the early twentieth century as an example of this phenomenon. Therefore, the best answer is D, which accurately expresses the main point of the passage.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North during the early 20th century. The passage explains that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Previous migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants. Therefore, the correct answer is D, which accurately summarizes the main point of the passage.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D") 

The passage provides an explanation of why the Great Migration of the African American population from the Southern US to the North occurred and why it persisted and even accelerated over the years. The main point of the passage is that first-time migrants faced different difficulties and costs that could hinder migration. However, the passage argues that previous migrants played a significant role in making it easier for later migrants to move, by passing information about labor- and housing-market conditions, offering temporary support, and providing a cultural and linguistic cushion. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Response 8:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the Great Migration, which occurred between 1915 and 1960, when African Americans migrated from the Southern United States to industrial Northern cities due to increased labor demand resulting from World War I, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and later on, momentum as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration. The passage describes how African Americans migrating northward were helped by earlier migrants who passed on information, reduced physical costs, provided temporary housing and credit, and acted as a cultural cushion.
A: This choice accurately states the fact that 40% of African Americans left the South between 1915-1960 during the Great Migration, but it does not cover the main findings of the passage.
B: This choice accurately states some of the reasons why the Great Migration occurred; however, it does not cover the main point of the passage and it does not elaborate on the factors that sustained the migration.
C: This is an accurate statement regarding why migration accelerated, but it is not the main point of the passage; instead, it elaborates one of the factors for migration's continuation.
D: This choice accurately summarizes the entire main idea of the passage. Africans Americans who migrated to the North were aided by the initial migrants who reduced physical costs through information sharing, offer of temporary housing and credit and passing on information that reduced adaptation costs for the new migrants.
E: While this choice is an accurate statement about the duration over several decades of the migration, it does not address the main point of the passage, which is that the earlier migrants were instrumental in providing financial, social and cultural assistance to the new migrants.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Insider trading involves trading stocks based on inside knowledge which is not available to the general public.
  Passage A argues that stock markets work efficiently when everyone has access to all relevant information so that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. It suggests that selling a stock because someone knows something that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping, which is good for everyone in the stock market. It also argues that the widespread practice of insider nontrading would not be a basis for locking someone up.
  Passage B argues that the stock market works best when there is transparency, and information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Insider-trading is a crime which occurs when material, nonpublic information is traded between an insider and someone else who is buying or selling the securities.
  - In Passage A the author is arguing that insider trading should be permitted because it helps market prices to reflect more accurate assessments of all the relevant facts, therefore it is good for everyone in the stock market.
  - In Passage B the author is arguing that insider trading is wrong because it is unfair to market participants who do not have access to the same information as insiders and may result in undermining investor confidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:

Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law can hinder the spreading of knowledge and impair the transparency of the stock market. It supports insider nontrading. 
  Passage B argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market, and trading based on inside information goes against it. It argues that investor confidence is essential to the stock market. 
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A reviews the benefits of stock markets gaining knowledge about available information to all parties, and encourages insider nontrading WHEN contemplating insider trading laws. 
  Passage B highlights the importance of transparency and an equal opportunity to success in the stock market. It mentions that insider trading can put the market at risk if not regulated properly.
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Insider-trading law makes it illegal to use information not available to the general public to make stock transactions.
  A: Passage A acknowledges that people with greater knowledge of a company can make more accurate decisions, which can help maintain an accurate evaluation of the company's value in the stock price. However, it also argues that insider trading law should be contemplated in light of the widespread practice of "insider nontrading." Passage B considers the principle of transparency, which implies that information that influences trading decisions should be available to all participants at the same time.
  B: Passage B considers transparency one of the basic principles of the stock market, suggesting that information should be available to all.
  C: Passage A recognizes that investors with greater knowledge of a company can make more accurate investment decisions but argues that insider trading law should be considered in light of insider nontrading and the benefits of information dissemination.
  D: The passages do not discuss insider nontrading regulation; they only highlight general concepts around insider trading law and the principle of transparency.
  E: Neither passage suggests that insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains how insider-trading law works and makes the argument that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. It argues that stock prices reflect everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value, that insider trading does not necessarily undermine this, and that insider nontrading is similarly to insider trading, but is never punished. 
  Passage B makes the argument that transparency is one of the basic principles of the stock market, and that insider trading undermines this because it means that some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have, which is unfair and could ultimately destroy the market. It argues that insider trading takes away from the merit and skill that can make investing and earning money from investing a worthwhile endeavor.

Response 0:
Knowledge: The second paragraph outlines the reasons for the Great Migration and suggests that once started, migration develops momentum over time. Early migrants provided information and assistance to later migrants that reduced their costs and allowed them to adapt more easily.

Action: Answer("D")  
The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain. The fact presented is that previous migrants reduced the cost of adapting to a new locale and culture for later migrants. The sentence is meant to support the idea that once started, migration develops momentum over time as early migrants provide information and assistance to later migrants.
Response 1:
Knowledge: The last sentence of the second paragraph is, "Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing." The sentence suggests that even after the income gap began to decrease, the Great Migration continued and even gained momentum. The third paragraph explains why migration developed momentum over time. Early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions. Previous migrants reduced new migrants' costs of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit, and also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants so they did not have to struggle as hard with their new surroundings.

Action: Answer("D") 
The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain, specifically that migration continued and even accelerated, even after the income gap began to decrease.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The second paragraph refers to the Great Migration, which took place between 1915 and 1960 when many African Americans migrated from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North.
  The last sentence of the second paragraph discusses the impact of previous migrants on the experience of later migrants.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 3:
Knowledge: The question is referring to the last sentence of the second paragraph, which states "We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration." This sentence refers to the idea that migration continued and even accelerated after the initial period of the Great Migration, despite the fact that North-South income differences were narrowing. The sentence is attempting to explain why this phenomenon occurred. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The second paragraph describes the main findings of previous research on the Great Migration. It suggests that once started, migration develops momentum over time, as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration, even when the income gap between North and South narrows. The paragraph explains the difficulties and one-time costs of migration, and how earlier migrants helped reduce these costs for new migrants by providing them with information about labor and housing markets, temporary housing, food, credit and a cultural cushion to help them adapt to their new surroundings. 
   
Action: Answer("D") 
The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain, namely, how earlier migrants reduced the cost of adapting to a new locale and culture for later migrants.

Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The question refers to the last sentence of the second paragraph, which reads: "In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration."
  
A: The sentence does not indicate that previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided.
B: The sentence suggests that the authors are extending their explanation by proposing a reason for why migration continued and accelerated. 
C: The sentence does not challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915.
D: The sentence presents the fact that the Great Migration continued and even accelerated despite North-South income differences narrowing, and the authors propose an explanation for this fact.
E: The sentence does not suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  The relationship between the necessary mechanical components of an automobile and its distinctive features is most closely analogous to the relationship between plants' primary and secondary substances. Just as a car requires certain fundamental components to function, such as an engine and transmission, but can still run without an aesthetic feature such as paint or taillights, plants require certain primary substances to grow and function, but it is their secondary substances that give them their distinctive tastes and smells.
Response 2:
Knowledge: Primary and secondary substances in plants are two categories of chemical substances that plants contain. The primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants, while the secondary substances are chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, but give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant. Insects have played a major role in many plants having secondary substances by selecting them based on the plants' abilities to attract or dissuade them.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.

  The passage discusses Taruskin's view that "high art" is produced by and for political and social elites, but fails to clarify the two different ways in which this production occurred throughout history. The first way is through commissioning a well-known artist, while the second way is through creating or having created a work that expresses and mirrors one's ideology and way of life. The passage also suggests that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced in the latter way, as it enables them to analyze how such art embodied the ideology of the elite. However, for this analysis to work, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived. Moreover, the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always produced enduring art, and some of that art has been produced by artists who found themselves on the margins of the establishment.
  
Analysis:
  The question asks which view Taruskin's position commits him to. The passage provides evidence that Taruskin believes in the production of "high art" by and for political and social elites, but the passage does not suggest that he believes the position described in any of the answer choices provided. Answer choice A suggests that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways, but there is no evidence of this in the passage. Answer choice B states that the most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite, but the passage does not discuss contemporary art. Answer choice C suggests that if "high art" endures despite appearing to undermine the ideology of the elite, it actually supports that ideology in some way, but the passage discusses how some enduring art went against the grain of elite values and was paid for by the establishment unwillingly with misgivings. Answer choice D suggests that typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by members of the aristocratic or middle classes, but the passage notes that artists who found themselves on the margins of the establishment produced some of that art. Answer choice E suggests that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways, which is not supported by the passage.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
The passage suggests that the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, analyzes how art embodied the ideology of the elite, although this may not always reflect the taste of the aristocratic or middle class and may be produced against the grain of elite values. It is also suggested that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. The passage does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite.
A: The passage does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
B: The passage does not suggest that the most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
C: The passage does suggest that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite may actually support that ideology in some way, although it must be analyzed to understand the ways in which it embodies the ideals of the elite.
D: The passage suggests that historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. However, it does not suggest that typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
E: The passage does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.

### Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: In the passage, the author discusses how dance was neglected as an area of social research due to most social scientists gravitating toward areas likely to be recognized as scientifically rigorous. The author also mentions that colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham, while studying traditional Caribbean dance forms, not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing. 

Analysis: The question asks what statement the peers mentioned in line 22 would most likely agree with about the study of dance. The preceding sentences state that dance was neglected as an area of social research by most social scientists because of a view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. This suggests that the peers mentioned in line 22 may have held the same view. 

Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, the most likely statement that the peers mentioned in line 22 would agree with is that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. Choice B represents this statement.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research in the past, and how Dunham's success was due to her training in anthropology and her approach to research.
  A: The passage does not suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: The passage does not suggest that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: The passage does not suggest that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: The passage does not suggest that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: The passage does not suggest that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about how dance was neglected as an area of social research because experts in dance were not trained in social research methods, while social scientists were not trained in dance techniques. The passage also mentions that colleagues advised Dunham not to become too involved in the dances she was observing, but she generally participated in them herself because of her interest and skill as a performer.
Action: Answer("B") 
The "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with choice B, that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them, since they believed that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research in the past.
  The passage highlights how Dunham's approach to research diverged from the prevailing methodology at the time, particularly with regard to detachment in data gathering.
  The passage suggests that Dunham's immersion in the dances herself yielded a more profound understanding of the cultural practices and techniques.

Action: Answer("B") 

Although the passage discusses how dance had been neglected as an area of social research, it does not suggest that the "peers" referred to in line 22 would have believed that "Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it." Nor does the passage suggest that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection. Instead, the passage discusses the challenges involved in reconciling the methodologies of social research and dance expertise, while underscoring how Dunham's immersion in the dances herself yielded a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the cultural practices and techniques. Therefore, of the choices offered, the best answer is "B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them."
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how dance had been neglected as a research area in anthropology because most social scientists were not trained in dance and because no dance experts were trained in social research methods. Dunham's success in dance ethnology was in part due to her diverging radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with choice B: "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them." This is because the prevailing methodology for social research at the time called for complete detachment from the phenomenon being studied, whereas Dunham eschewed caution and participated in the dances herself to gain a deeper understanding of them. The peers mentioned in line 22 would likely have seen complete detachment as necessary to obtain reliable data, which is why Dunham's approach would have diverged radically from what they would have considered legitimate modes of inquiry. Therefore, they would have been most likely to agree with choice B, which implies a detachment from a field as esoteric as dance.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research in the past, primarily because of a lack of experts in both dance and social research.
  The prevailing view in social research at that time was that effective data gathering must be conducted from a position of complete detachment, which is now recognized as unrealistic.
  Katherine Dunham's success in studying dance forms was due in part to her approach of participating in the dances herself.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the history of dance ethnology and Katherine Dunham's approach to the field, specifically her involvement in the dances she was studying.
  The passage suggests that the methodology prevailing at the time emphasized detachment.
A: The passage does not suggest that most social scientists misinterpreted dance.
B: The passage argues that Dunham's expertise in both anthropology and dance was crucial to her success, suggesting that social scientists need to be well versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data.
C: The passage does not argue that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
D: The passage does not suggest that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
E: The passage does not argue that dance forms are too variable to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: Katherine Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology and her approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. No other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research.

Action: Answer("B")  

Explanation: The peers mentioned in the passage would have been most likely to agree with the statement "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them," as they subscribed to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. This is supported by the passage, which states that "most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry" and that "experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research."
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about Katherine Dunham's development of dance-isolation technique, her training in both anthropological research and choreography, and her research-to-performance method in adapting Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance. 
  The passage mentions that dance had been neglected as an area of social research primarily because most social scientists did not understand dance techniques and that experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research.
Action: Answer("B") 
Reasoning: The passage does not support the idea that dance is misunderstood or misinterpreted as a cultural phenomenon, nor does it support the idea that research into dance cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision. The passage suggests that social scientists at the time had not considered dance as an area of social research because they were not themselves trained in the techniques of dance, and that they believed that effective data gathering must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. Therefore, of the given choices, the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them would have been most likely to be agreed upon by the peers mentioned in the passage.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about how dance as an area of social research was previously neglected and how Katherine Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Her approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time and she was able to comprehensively understand various dances as complex cultural practices through prolonged immersion of the dance form. 
A: The passage doesn't support this statement
B: The passage doesn't support this statement
C: The passage doesn't say research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision. Instead, it talks about how Katherine Dunham was successful in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from certain cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance primarily because of her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
D: The passage doesn't support this statement
E: The passage doesn't support this statement

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: We are told that it is not within the "province of woman," to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a "political question," and we are "stepping out of our  sphere," when we take part in its discussion. It is nottrue that it is merely a political question, it is likewise a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of religion; a question which, while it involves considerations of immense importance to the welfare and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into thehome-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to unrequited toil-whether he shall walk erect in the dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckonedamong the beasts which perish - whether his bones and sinews shall be his own, or another's-whether his child shall receive the protection of its natural guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest ofthe master may dictate $\_\ldots$ these considerations are all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.And is a subject comprehending interests of such magnitude, merely a "political question," and one in which woman "can take no part without losingsomething of the modesty and gentleness which are her most appropriate ornaments"? May not the "ornament of a meek and quiet spirit" exist with an upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart isopen to the claims of humanity, or less modest because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their rescue?By the Constitution of the United States, the  whole physical power of the North is pledged for the suppression of domestic insurrections, and should the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the North are bound to make common cause with the 40 tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet, every effort on the part of the slave, for the attainment of his freedom. And when the father, husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes to mingle in the unholy warfare, "to become the 45 executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands,"1 will the mother, wife, daughter, and sister feel that they have no interest in this subject? Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and50 their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she55 will not be deterred from the performance of her duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the cry of political question.But admitting it to be a political question, have we no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not60 permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of our own family circle, and of the present hour? May we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the 65 earth? Must we witness "the headlong rage or heedless folly," with which our nation is rushing onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its downward course? Shall we silently behold the land which we love with all the heart-warm affection of70 children, rendered a hissing and a reproach throughout the world, by this system which is already tolling the death-bell of her decease among the nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright75 prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely our hearts cling to "our altars and our homes," the80 more fervent are our aspirations that every inhabitant of our land may be protected in his fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom85 God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our course, then, still be onward!
Question: Which choice best summarizes the first paragraph?
Choices:
  A: Smith explains a conventional viewpoint and presents evidence supporting it.
  B: Smith rejects a claim and elaborates on her reasons for doing so.
  C: Smith introduces her subject and provides historical background for understanding it.
  D: Smith identifies a problem and proposes steps to remedy it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The first paragraph starts with a claim that women are told that they can't discuss the subject of slavery and that it is a "political question." But Smith rejects this claim by stating that it is a question of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. She argues that these considerations are involved in the question of liberty or slavery, and thus it is not a political question alone. Therefore, choice B is the best summary of the first paragraph. Choice A is incorrect because Smith presents evidence opposing the conventional viewpoint, rather than supporting it. Choice C is incorrect because Smith mainly discusses the subject matter and its implications rather than providing historical background. Choice D is incorrect because Smith only identifies the problem but does not propose any solution to remedy it.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The first paragraph introduces a conventional perspective that women shouldn't discuss the subject of slavery, and Smith rejects it by explaining how the question of slavery involves matters of justice, morality, and religion that impact millions of people. Smith argues that women are perfectly capable of discussing slavery and that it is not just a political question, but also a question of humanity. Therefore, choice B, which states that Smith rejects a claim and elaborates on her reasons for doing so, best summarizes the first paragraph.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The first paragraph of the passage rejects a conventional viewpoint which suggests that women should not take part in political discussions surrounding the subject of slavery and elaborates on why this viewpoint is incorrect. Therefore, choice B is the best summary of the first paragraph.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The first paragraph rejects a common belief that women should not discuss the subject of slavery and elaborates on reasons why this belief is incorrect.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")  
The first paragraph opens with the conventional viewpoint that women should not discuss the subject of slavery since it is a political question and outside their sphere. Smith rejects this claim and provides reasons to support her argument that slavery is a question of justice, humanity, morality, and religion that enters deeply into the concerns of millions of people.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The first paragraph presents the idea that some people believe slavery is only a political issue, and that women should not be involved in its discussion. 
  The paragraph goes on to argue that the issue of slavery involves more than just politics, and relates to issues of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. 
  It contends that women, despite being told to stay away from such discussions, have a duty to involve themselves in the issue of slavery, because they have a stake in the outcome. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The first paragraph describes a conventional viewpoint that women should not discuss the subject of slavery because it is a political question and not within their sphere of discussion. However, Smith rejects this claim by arguing that slavery is not only a political question but also a matter of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. She provides evidence to support her claims, elaborating on her reasons for rejecting the conventional viewpoint. Therefore, choice B best summarizes the first paragraph.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B") 

The first paragraph of the passage rejects the claim that women should not discuss the subject of slavery, even though it is often considered a political issue. The author elaborates on reasons why this is not the case and presents evidence for why women should be involved in the discussion.
Response 8:
Knowledge: The first paragraph of the text discusses the topic of slavery and how women are discouraged from participating in discussions about it. The author argues that slavery is not merely a political question, but it is also a question of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. The author also questions the belief that women should not participate in discussions about slavery. 
A: The text does not present a conventional viewpoint and evidence to support it, so this choice is incorrect. 
B: Smith does reject the claim that it is not within the "province of woman" to discuss slavery but provides reasons for doing so. However, this choice is too narrow and does not cover the whole paragraph. 
C: The first paragraph does not introduce the subject or provide historical background. Instead, it focuses on a specific aspect of the subject. 
D: While the author does identify a problem - the fact that women are discouraged from discussing slavery - she does not offer any solutions in this paragraph. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
The first paragraph focuses on rejecting a conventional viewpoint and elaborating on reasons for doing so. The author argues that slavery is not merely a political question but rather a complex issue that involves considerations of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. She rejects the notion that it is not "within the province of woman" to discuss slavery, stating that it is a subject that comprehends interests of such magnitude that it cannot be reduced to a purely political question. Thus, choice B best summarizes the first paragraph.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets.

Choices:
  A: Vesta is not the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt.
  B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
  C: iron fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  D: there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem", which refers to the rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection and the asteroid belt. Scientists believe that rocky fragments do not survive as well as iron fragments when asteroids break apart because rocky material lies near the surface while iron lies in the core. If collisional erosion was the whole story, then differentiated asteroids would have been disrupted early on, and almost none of them should have survived. The parent bodies of the primitive asteroids would have formed later in the asteroid belt. Many of the fragments from disrupted asteroids, both iron and rocky, would have arrived in the asteroid belt. However, only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage talks about the rarity of mantle rocks in the meteorite collections and in the asteroid belt. Due to collisional erosion, rocky material would be the first to be removed when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to survive in space longer than iron ones. Iron is much stronger than rock, and it is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the same size.
Action: Answer("B") 
So, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find that the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage suggests that differentiated asteroids are rare in the asteroid belt, and that the "missing mantle problem" is a long-standing puzzle. Scientists believe that iron fragments may better survive collisions than rocky fragments due to the positioning of iron in a differentiated asteroid's interior. Primitive asteroids, which are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites (the most common type of meteorites found on Earth), are no stronger than mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids, but they appear to have survived in the asteroid belt. Scientists thus have been trying to understand why differentiated asteroids have not survived while primitive ones have.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then, as a result, scientists would expect to find that the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how collisional erosion might explain why there are very few intact differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt and why iron fragments are more common than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  A: The passage does not make any suggestion about the number of large differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt aside from Vesta.
  B: The passage does not discuss the number of primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed.
  C: The passage does not make any suggestion about the relative size of iron and rocky fragments in the asteroid belt aside from stating that iron fragments are stronger and thus more likely to survive.
  D: The passage suggests that differentiated bodies were relatively rare to begin with and that most differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions. Primitive asteroids, on the other hand, may have been more resilient to such collisions, and they formed later in the asteroid belt. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" and why rocky material is less common in meteorites and the asteroid belt compared to iron material. The passage suggests that the rarity of mantle rocks in the asteroid belt cannot be explained entirely through collisional erosion. Primitive asteroids, which are no stronger than mantle rocks, survived while differentiated asteroids were destroyed. The passage proposes that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites may have formed closer to the Sun, where collisions would have been more frequent.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then, as a result, scientists would expect to find that the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" - the rarity of finding mantle rocks (corresponding to the rocky material that formed the mantles of asteroids that melted) in meteorite collections and the asteroid belt. 
  The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt were sufficient to explain the "missing mantle problem," then most, if not all, mantle material would have been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of years since then.
  The passage does not provide information to support any of the other answer choices.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," where the mantle rocks of iron parent bodies are not found in meteorites as frequently as expected.
  The passage suggests that iron fragments survive better than rocky fragments when an asteroid breaks apart. Iron tends to lay in the core while rocky material lays near the surface, so rocky fragments have to survive in space for longer than iron ones.
  Collisional erosion cannot be the entire explanation for the missing mantle problem, as primitive asteroids are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
  Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues suggest that the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the sun, where collisions would have been more frequent and thus, most differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage mentions that the “missing mantle problem” is a long-standing puzzle and differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions. Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" and the rarity of mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt. 
  The passage also suggests that many, if not most, differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions and that only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  The passage then suggests that the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt and most of those objects survived.
  The passage also suggests that Vesta is a differentiated asteroid that survived and has only one large crater on its surface, and that perhaps the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which is the rarity of mantel rocks in our meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt, and how it is a long-standing puzzle. The passage notes that the rarity of mantle rocks in the asteroid belt cannot be fully explained by collisional erosion.
  A: The passage does not suggest anything specific about the number of large differentiated asteroids, so this option is not correct.
  B: There is information regarding primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt, but the passage does not suggest that collisional erosion would affect their numbers. This option is not correct.
  C: The passage does not discuss the size of iron fragments versus rocky fragments in the asteroid belt, so this option is not correct.
  D: The passage suggests that if almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions, then scientists would expect to find that there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Many millennia before the invention of herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a  valuable part of an integrated weed-management 5 program. Although plowing kills standing weeds, farmers have long known that it often leads to the emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.Ecologists have shown that a farmer's field can have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter 10 buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists have shown that seeds buried more than about one centimeter below the soil surface do not receive enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow, which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil15 surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by exposure to sunlight?Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a 20 relatively simple experiment, they went to ten different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then25 exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples, weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a "light break," and this stimulates their 30 germination.More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany reasoned that when farmers plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is35 turned over, and that this stimulates their germination. Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if40 farmers simply plowed their fields during the night, when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which photons hit the surface] is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. Although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike 45 each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when he first came up with this idea because he assumed 50 that such a simple method of weed control as plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated 55 that the method can be effective.Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip60 at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas 65 only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.This method of weed control is currently being used by several farmers in Germany. Because many of the same weed species that invade farmers' fields70 in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world, this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact, recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon, Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina support this idea.

Question: The passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been
Choices:
  A: lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
  B: higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.
  C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
  D: comparable to Hartmann's original projection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Karl Hartmann conducted a study to determine whether plowing fields at night would reduce the number of weed seedlings that emerged compared to plowing during the day.
  No crops were planted in the pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  The passage does not provide any information about what would happen if crops were planted on the agricultural strips.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Karl Hartmann tested the effectiveness of plowing fields at night instead of daytime to control weed growth. The pilot experiment showed that more than 80% of the surface area of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds. However, no crops were planted in the experiment to avoid competition with the emerging weeds. Thus, the passage does not provide information about what would have happened if the strips were planted with wheat or corn.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann showed that plowing fields at night can result in less weed growth.
  Hartmann's experiment involved plowing fields without planting any crops on them.
  The passage does not provide any information about how planting crops could affect the growth of weeds in the fields.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  In Karl Hartmann's experiment in Germany, he plowed two agricultural strips near Altershausen, one at around midday and the other strip at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds. 
  Therefore, it is likely that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been higher than the percentage that Hartmann had found.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann where he plowed two agricultural strips, one at midday and the other at night, and tested his idea that seeds are exposed to sunlight and germinate when plowed during the day. 
  No crops were planted in the pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. 
  More than 80% of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds. 
  The experiment suggests that plowing during the night can help reduce weed growth. 
  The passage does not suggest what the percentage of surface coverage would be if crops were planted.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann in which he tested the effectiveness of plowing fields at night to control weed growth.
  In the experiment, Hartmann found that the strip of field plowed during the day had more weed growth than the strip plowed at night.
  No crops were planted in the field, so there was no competition with the emerging weeds.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  Since the experiment did not involve planting crops, it is uncertain how effective plowing at night would be if crops were planted in the field. 
  Therefore, it is likely that the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would be higher than the percentage that Hartmann found if crops were planted on the two agricultural strips. 
  Choice B suggests this possibility.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes an experiment by Karl Hartmann in which he plowed two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany, one strip cultivated at around midday and the other strip cultivated at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results showed that more than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  
  A: The passage states that the percentage of the surface of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds was only about 2 percent. The passage does not suggest that Seydel would have had a lower percentage of surface of each strip covered with weeds if he had planted wheat or corn.
  
  B: The passage does not suggest that planting wheat or corn on the two strips would result in a higher percentage of weeds. 
  
  C: The passage provides evidence from Hartmann's experiment showing that planting crops is not necessary for weed control when plowing at night. Therefore, it is not impossible for Hartmann to determine weed emergence in a field containing crops.
  
  D: The passage does not provide information on Hartmann's original projection, making it impossible to determine whether the emergence of weeds in a field of crops would be comparable to Hartmann's projection.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Hartmann conducted a pilot experiment to test his idea of controlling weeds by plowing at night.
  No crops were planted in the pilot experiment to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  In the pilot experiment, Seydel cultivated one strip at midday and the other strip at night.
  More than 80% of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  The passage doesn't provide any information about how this method would perform in the presence of crops.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  In Hartmann's experiment, two agricultural strips were plowed near Altershausen, Germany, and the farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip at around midday and the other strip at night.
  No crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  The passage does not provide information about the effect of planting wheat or corn on the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage describes an experiment by Karl Hartmann in which he plowed two agricultural strips at different times and observed the difference in weed growth. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid competition with the emerging weeds.

A: There is no evidence to support this claim in the passage. The experiment did not involve planting crops, so it is unclear how planting crops would have affected weed growth on the agricultural strips.
B: There is no evidence to support this claim in the passage. The experiment did not involve planting crops, so it is unclear how planting crops would have affected weed growth on the agricultural strips.
C: While it is possible that planting crops would have made it difficult to determine the effect of plowing on weed growth, this is not the focus of the passage and is not mentioned.
D: Since no crops were planted in the pilot experiments, Hartmann likely did not make projections about the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds if crops had been planted. Therefore, it is unclear whether the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would have been comparable to Hartmann's original projection.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, "Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."40 He picked up a bird shape: "Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought." He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: "Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind."As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. "Look here," Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. "See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this." And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. "The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price."I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.

Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.
Question: It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that the main reason that the narrator considers Great Expectations to be the best gift he ever received is because

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about a boy who loves books and reading. 
  The boy's father does not like books and forbids the boy from reading at night.
  The boy is presented with the gift of a book by Sempere, the owner of the bookshop that he frequents.
  The book is Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. 
  The boy reads the book repeatedly.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that the main reason that the narrator considers Great Expectations to be the best gift he ever received is because reading the book convinced him that he wanted to be a writer. The narrator loves books and reading, and the experience of reading Great Expectations was so transformative for him that he decided he wanted to write like Dickens. The passage does not suggest that the gift was the best he ever received because he had only ever been given sweets and snacks as gifts in the past. While Sempere's high regard for the narrator may have been a contributing factor to the importance of the gift, the passage doesn't indicate that this is the main reason. Finally, while the passage indicates that Sempere knew some authors, it doesn't suggest that he was a friend of Charles Dickens.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: The data in table 2 best support which statement about the woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey?
Choices:
  A: At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
  B: After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether.
  C: After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
  D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

The passage states that Ralphord asked Miss Spivey what she studied at Barnard College and Miss Spivey explained that Barnard was the sister school of Columbia University. The passage also states that Miss Spivey avoided Ralphord's eye when he asked questions. This suggests that Miss Spivey may have found Ralphord's question to be unimportant or beneath her. However, the passage does not suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge, that she is dismissive and disinterested, or that the children want to amuse her with their questions.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis," says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. "Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth," Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. "We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment," Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 "standard of care treatment." That's going to take five years and $\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.

Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins. 
  Passage 2 describes research finding that individual soil bacteria can be grown in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals, and that this methodology opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibiotic-producing bacteria.
Action: Answer("C") 
The experiment described in Passage 1 tested the effectiveness of teixobactin in treating mice infected with bacteria causing upper respiratory tract infections, but there is no information in either passage indicating that the upper respiratory tract infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the information in Passage 2 best supports the conclusion that the upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria, making choice C the best answer.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes an experiment with mice using teixobactin antibiotic to treat upper respiratory tract infections caused by several disease-causing bacteria. 
  The passage describes how teixobactin targets the bacteria by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically, breaking down the bacterial cell walls. 
  The passage also mentions that many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to produce different structures.
  Passage 2 describes how researchers were able to grow types of bacteria from soil, including types that can't normally be grown in the laboratory, to find new natural antibiotics.
  The passage also describes a recent study where researchers found they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals.

Action: Answer("C") 
The information in Passage 2 best supports the conclusion that the upper respiratory tract infections in the mice in the experiment described in Passage 1 were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria, as teixobactin is ineffective against gram-negative bacteria and it was used to treat and eliminate the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study that isolated and grew individual soil bacteria in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals, to cultivate potentially antibiotic-producing bacteria.
  The first new antibiotic that they found by this approach, teixobactin, killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed the tuberculosis bacterium.
  The passage also mentions that teixobactin does not kill Gram-negative opportunists, it is too big to cross their complex cell wall.
Action: Answer("C")  
The passage in Passage 2 states that teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, and the tuberculosis bacterium. Since there is no mention of Gram-negative bacteria causing the upper respiratory tract infections in the mice in Passage 1, Information in Passage 2 best supports the conclusion that the upper respiratory tract infections in the experiment described in Passage 1 were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria. Thus, the answer is C.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that in animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those that have developed immunity to other drugs. Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
  
Option Analysis:
  A: Passage 2 does not give any information about subsequent infections, so this option is not supported.
  B: Passage 2 does not provide any information that relates to this option. So, this option is not supported.
  C: It is stated in Passage 1 that mice were infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae). It also states that teixobactin knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects. In Passage 2, it is stated that teixobactin "killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice." Therefore, it is likely that the upper respiratory tract infections the mice were experiencing were caused by gram-positive bacteria, which are susceptible to teixobactin. So, this option is supported.
  D: Passage 1 states that "The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to produce different structures." This means that teixobactin attacks lipid molecules and not proteins. Therefore, this option is not supported.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: According to the passage, which statement best explains why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close?
Choices:
  A: The second trigger produces an electrical charge that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger.
  B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
  C: The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open.
  D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these "low-threshold" nerves "C-tactile," or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations
Question: Based on the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected which condition to result from the blocking of fast fibers?
Choices:
  A: The rate at which other nerve fibers fired would increase.
  B: The test subject would perceive gentle stimuli as painful.
  C: The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
  D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.

  In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The passage states that in the early 1990s, textbooks believed that blocking fast fibers would eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers would only reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock. The passage does not provide evidence or suggest that blocking fast fibers would lead to any of the other choices. However, it does suggest that the body compensates by using slow fibers to sense pressure when fast fibers are blocked. Therefore, the most likely answer is (C) The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.

  In the early 1990s, textbooks asserted that slow-conducting nerves only responded to pain and temperature.
  Sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers.

Action: Answer("C")  
Based on the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected the body to compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure if the blocking of fast fibers occurred.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Textbooks in the early 1990s thought that slow fibers responded only to pain and temperature, while pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along fast-signaling nerve fibers. Blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether. 
A: The passage does not suggest that blocking fast fibers leads to an increase in the firing rate of other nerve fibers. 
B: The passage does not suggest that textbook authors in the early 1990s would have expected blocking fast fibers to cause test subjects to perceive gentle stimuli as painful. 
C: The passage suggests that Håkan Olausson and his colleagues wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. Thus, the body already uses slow fibers to sense pressure, but the authors may not have expected this. 
D: The passage does not suggest that the blocking of fast fibers impairs the ability to perceive vibrations. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Based on the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected the body to compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure if fast fibers were blocked. This is because blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock. Therefore, the passage suggests that slow fibers are still involved in the perception of pressure, and that the body would rely on them if fast fibers were blocked. Thus, the correct answer is C.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers.
  Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported the notion.
  Preventing fast fibers from firing seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage describes the experiments that Håkan Olausson and his colleagues did on nerve fibers that respond to gentle pressure. The experiment also investigated the difference between slow and fast nerve fibers and their responses to signals. Blocking fast fibers only reduced sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock, whereas disrupting slow fibers were seen to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves and fast-conducting nerves. 
  Soft pressure and vibration sensations were believed to travel only along fast-conducting nerve fibers. 
  Experiments blocking nerve fibers showed that preventing fast fibers from firing seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.
  Blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Action: Answer("C") 
According to the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected the body to compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure if fast fibers were blocked. This is because the experiments blocking nerve fibers seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock, which implies that other nerve fibers were still functioning to perceive these stimuli. Slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals, as shown by Håkan Olausson and his colleagues' experiments in 1993, which identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers and confirmed the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Textbooks in the early 1990s believed that myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers conveyed information about location, as well as sensations of pressure and vibration. Slow-conducting nerves were believed to only respond to two types of stimuli: pain and temperature. 
  Blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect

Choices:
  A: primitive.
  B: basaltic.
  C: high in reflectivity.
  D: low in reflectivity.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The article mentions that the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, the most common type of meteorite found on Earth, are primitive asteroids, and that differentiated asteroids are rare. It also suggests that only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system, which implies that many rocky objects have not survived. The table provided in the question shows that over 99% of the mass in the asteroid belt is contained in objects over 1 km in diameter.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage does not provide a data table.
  The passage discusses the composition and survival of asteroids in the asteroid belt and how that relates to the missing mantle problem.
  Primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites.
  Iron fragments are stronger than rocky fragments, which may explain why iron fragments survive better in space than rocky fragments.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage does not provide a table, so there is no data to support any conclusion about the mass of asteroids in the asteroid belt based on their reflectivity or composition.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses differentiated asteroids and primitive asteroids, and their survival in the asteroid belt.
  Primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, and are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
  Differentiated asteroids are rare in the asteroid belt today and may have been disrupted by violent collisions.
  Iron fragments might survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart because iron lies in the core of a differentiated asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface. Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last to be exposed.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the types of asteroids in the asteroid belt. It mentions that primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. There were fewer differentiated bodies to begin with, and they were relatively more rare. Objects that formed closer to the sun would have been more tightly packed and experienced more frequent collisions, which might have resulted in most differentiated bodies being disrupted by violent collisions. As a result, only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses different types of asteroids in the asteroid belt and how they may have formed. 
  The passage suggests that differentiated bodies (those with cores and mantles) were relatively rare, and most of the rocky mantle material may have been lost over time. Iron fragments may have survived better than rocky fragments due to their strength and position in the cores of asteroids. Primitive asteroids, which are no stronger than mantle rocks, may have formed in the asteroid belt and survived due to the lack of disruptive collisions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The given text does not provide a clear indication of the answer.
  The text explains that primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth, but it does not suggest that primitive asteroids are the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt. 
  The text also explains that iron meteorites may have formed closer to the Sun and arrived in the asteroid belt as fragments, which suggests that metallic asteroids may be more prevalent than rocky ones, but this is not a definitive conclusion.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: If Meltzer’s findings (Passage 2) are accurate, what can most reasonably be inferred about the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1?
Choices:
  A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  B: They are a product of the global cooling that occurred during the Younger Dryas period.
  C: They were found in highest concentrations at Clovis archaeological sites.
  D: They may have played some role in the tool technology of the Clovis people.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a team's argument that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, causing temperatures to plunge for the next millennium. The team argues that this idea explains the observed cooling of the climate and disappearance of the Clovis hunters, as well as the extinction of the large mammals in North America. The evidence comes in the form of geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America, which contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact, such as spherules of glass and carbon, and amounts of the element iridium said to be too high to have originated on Earth.
  Passage 2 presents Meltzer's argument that when the quality and accuracy of the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, in which impact advocates reported evidence for a cosmic collision, is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 presents the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which argues that an extraterrestrial impact caused a cooling period known as Younger Dryas around 13,000 years ago, leading to the disappearance of the Clovis hunters and extinction of large mammals across North America.
  Passage 2 challenges the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis by questioning the accuracy of the dating methods used to support the hypothesis.
  The glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1 are part of the evidence used in support of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. 
Action: Answer("A")  
If Meltzer’s findings (Passage 2) are accurate, it can most reasonably be inferred that the glass and carbon spherules found in Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas, since the Younger Dryas onset only spans a short period around 12,800 years ago, according to Meltzer's team.
Response 2:
Passage 1 states that the team argues that certain features of the sedimentary layers, say the team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of glass and carbon, and amounts of the element iridium said to be too high to have originated on Earth. However, Passage 2 argues that when the quality and accuracy of the dating is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her50 reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an55 orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....Consider, sir, dispassionately, these60 observations-for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, "that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it65 was impossible to explain." If so, on what does your constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this70 country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman-prescription.Consider-I address you as a legislatorwhether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their75 own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift 80 of reason?In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be 85 useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?

  A: privileged one gender over the other.

Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses the author's argument for the rights of women based on the principle that education is necessary for the progress of knowledge and virtue. 
  A: The passage describes the subjugation of women and the oppression they face. It does not mention freedoms or privileges granted by society's leaders.
  B: The passage argues that women's education and situation shut them out from investigations into moral and civil interests, which can stifle progress in knowledge and virtue.
  C: The passage argues that the love of mankind and orderly virtues can only be produced by considering moral and civil interests.
  D: The passage argues that women's rights have been denied and that there is a need for their education so that they can understand their virtue. The passage does not mention equality for all people. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 argues for the education of women, believing that it is necessary for the progress of knowledge and virtue, as well as for the promotion of the general good. The passage addresses the oppression of women as a political phenomenon, and the author challenges the argument from prescription, which maintains that social and political customs are justified because they have always existed.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Follow the money and you will end up in space. That's the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on mining beyond Earth.Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for 5 Space Engineering Research, the event brought together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar scientists, and government agencies that are all working to make space mining a reality.The forum comes hot on the heels of the 102012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms. Planetary Resources of Washington says it will launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years, while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020 . Another15 commercial venture that sprung up in 2012, Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to the moon, including to potential lunar miners.Within a few decades, these firms may be meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as20 platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital for personal electronics, such as yttrium and lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who transformed the western United States, the first space miners won't just enrich themselves. They also hope25 to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds with Earth, in which the materials extracted and processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered for space-based projects.In this scenario, water mined from other 30 worlds could become the most desired commodity. "In the desert, what's worth more: a kilogram of gold or a kilogram of water?" asks Kris Zacny of HoneyBee Robotics in New York. "Gold is useless. Water will let you live."35 Water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary 40 refuelling stations. Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into 45 concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.\section{Passage 2}The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting from discovery to economics. The past year has seen a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few0 billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain: the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could enrich us all.But before the miners start firing up their rockets, we should pause for thought. At first glance, space55 mining seems to sidestep most environmental concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids, and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences -both here on Earth and in space -merit careful consideration.60 Part of this is about principles. Some will argue that space's "magnificent desolation" is not ours to despoil, just as they argue that our own planet's poles should remain pristine. Others will suggest that glutting ourselves on space's riches is not an65 acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable ways of earthly life.History suggests that those will be hard lines to hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public that such barren environments are worth preserving.70 After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even fewer people will experience them than have walked through Antarctica's icy landscapes.There's also the emerging off-world economy to consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and 75 beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely been broached-and the relevant legal and regulatory framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are 80 often reluctant to engage with such questions.One speaker at last week's space-mining forum in Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that regulation should be avoided. But miners have much to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit 85 exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek one out
Question: The author of Passage 1 indicates that space mining could have which positive effect?

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the  labyrinthine streets of London might have oncabbies' brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to beinvolved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies-a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The moreyears a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.The brain is a mutable organ, capable-within limits-of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known asneuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structurewas more or less static. Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.After her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with ElizabethValentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the Londoncabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners  and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical 45 differences in the brains of the memory champs, evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural50 difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. What's more, on every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes' scores came back well within the normal range. The 55 memory champs weren't smarter, and they didn't have special brains.But there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the researchers looked at which parts of the 60 brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry. According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be 65 working in overdrive for the mental athletes.Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial70 navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn't seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in 75 their mind's eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating like London cabbies when they're supposed to be remembering the shapes of snowflakes?Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes 80 to describe exactly what was going through their minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said they were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial85 journeys. They weren't doing this automatically, or because it was an inborn talent they'd nurtured since childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural activity that Maguire's fMRIs turned up were the result of training and practice
Question: Which question was Maguire's study of mental athletes primarily intended to answer?
Choices:
  A: Does the act of memorization make use of different brain structures than does the act of navigation?
  B: Do mental athletes inherit their unusual brain structures, or do the structures develop as a result of specific activities?
  C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
  D: What is the relationship between general cognitive ability and the unusual brain structures of mental athletes?

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, what potential criticism might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model?
Choices:
  A: Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.
  B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  C: Volkov's direct application of an electrical current would have been objectionable to Hodick and Sievers.
  D: Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes research into the physiology of the Venus flytrap, particularly into how it encodes and stores information about potential prey in order to determine if the prey is large enough to warrant closing its trap.
  The research performed by Hodick and Sievers proposed that the flytrap stores information in the electric charge of its leaf, and that a relatively high concentration of calcium is needed to close the trap.
  Subsequent research, including that of Volkov and his colleagues, supports Hodick and Sievers's model by demonstrating that electricity is involved in the closing of the trap.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, a potential criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model. While Volkov's research supports the general idea that electricity is involved in the Venus flytrap's closing, the passage does not indicate that Volkov measured calcium levels, which is a key component of Hodick and Sievers's model. As such, it is possible that Volkov's measurements did not fully support the proposed mechanism of how the flytrap stores and recalls information about potential prey.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that the Venus flytrap stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  Their model is based on the fact that touching a trigger hair causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
  Calcium concentration needs to be maintained at a high enough level so that a second hair that is stimulated can push the calcium concentration over a threshold and spring the trap.
  Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University demonstrated that it is electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close.
  Volkov tested the model by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap.
  If the electrical charge accumulated between two electrodes was at least 14 microcoulombs within twenty seconds, the trap would close.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, a potential criticism that might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model. Specifically, while Volkov demonstrated that it is electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close, the amount of electrical charge that he determined was needed to close the trap did not directly relate to the calcium concentration required for the trap to close.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes research on how a Venus flytrap stores and recalls information about its prey using electric charges and calcium levels.
  Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close and they tested the Hodick and Sievers model using electrical current. 
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap, causing an increase in the concentration of calcium ions. They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. 
  Volkov and his colleagues showed that electrical charges could cause the trap to close without directly touching the trigger hairs, and that as long as a certain amount of electrical charge flowed between two electrodes, the trap would close.
Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, the criticism that might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model. While Volkov's work did demonstrate that the Venus flytrap closes due to electrical charges, it did not directly measure calcium levels and did not necessarily support the part of Hodick and Sievers's model that proposed the role of calcium in the storage and recall of information regarding how many trigger hairs have been touched.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how the Venus flytrap encodes information about potential prey and stores it in the form of electrical charge.
  Volkov and his colleagues tested the hypothesis that electrical charge is responsible for the Venus flytrap's closing.
  Their experiments suggested that, as long as fourteen microcoulombs of electricity flowed between two electrodes placed on the lobes of the trap, the trap closed.

Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, a potential criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that, while Volkov's experiments supported the idea that electrical charge causes the Venus flytrap to close, they did not measure calcium levels, which are central to Hodick and Sievers's proposed model. Therefore, Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes an experiment by Volkov and colleagues that tested the model proposed by Hodick and Sievers.
  According to Hodick and Sievers's model, a single trigger hair being touched causes an electric action potential that opens calcium channels in the Venus flytrap's leaf. However, a second trigger hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over a threshold required for the trap to close.
  Volkov and colleagues demonstrated that electric current can cause the trap to close without direct touch to its trigger hairs.
  Volkov and colleagues were able to determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close, and that it could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. 
  The passage does not suggest that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect, or that Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
Choice B is correct because the passage suggests that Volkov's measurements - while demonstrating that electricity can cause the Venus flytrap to close - did not provide evidence that directly corroborated the key element of Hodick and Sievers's model: that the concentration of calcium ions must reach a certain threshold in order for the Venus flytrap to close.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  In the passage, the Venus flytrap encodes information in an electric charge when it senses a potential prey.
  Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn proposed the idea that Venus flytrap stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close.
  Volkov and his colleagues used very fine electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap to close it and determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.

Action: Answer("B") 

Based on the passage, the potential criticism that might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the Venus flytrap, how it senses and reacts to potential prey, and how it encodes and stores information after being triggered by an insect.
  Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University tested the hypothesis proposed by Hodick and Sievers about the relationship between the electric charge of the leaf and the storage of information, and found that the Venus flytrap closes due to electricity.
A: The passage does not provide any evidence that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.
B: According to the passage, Volkov's testing supported Hodick and Sievers's model by showing that the Venus flytrap closes due to electrical charges, which is a central element of their model.
C: The passage does not suggest that Hodick and Sievers would have found Volkov's direct application of an electrical current objectionable.
D: The passage does not indicate that Hodick and Sievers did not have access to the technology used by Volkov and his colleagues.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the flytrap's method of encoding and storing information regarding its prey. 
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that the electric charge of the flytrap's leaf encodes the information of how many hairs have been touched. 
  Volkov and his colleagues found that electricity caused the Venus flytrap to close and could determine the exact electrical charge needed to close the trap. 

Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, a potential criticism that could be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model. While Volkov's experiment demonstrated that electricity could cause the Venus flytrap to close, the passage does not mention whether his measurements supported the idea that the electric charge of the leaf encodes the information of how many hairs have been touched.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how the Venus flytrap encodes and stores information regarding how many trigger hairs have been touched by an insect before closing its trap.
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf and that the trap required a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
  Volkov and his colleagues demonstrated that it is electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap.
  Volkov determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close by altering the amount of electrical current.
Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, potential criticism that might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about a model proposed by Hodick and Sievers that explains the encoding and storage of prey information by the Venus flytrap in terms of the concentration of calcium ions triggered by touching the trigger hairs. 
  Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama tested the model by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap and determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Voters need to understand the prosaic details of.complex policies. Most have staked out positions on.these issues, but they are not often reasoned.positions, which take hard intellectual work. Most.citizens opt instead for simplistic explanations,.assuming wrongly that they comprehend the nuances.of issues..Psychological scientists have a name for this.easy, automatic, simplistic thinking: the illusion of.explanatory depth. We strongly believe that we.understand complex matters, when in fact we are.clueless, and these false and extreme beliefs.shape our preferences, judgments, and actions—.including our votes..Is it possible to shake such deep-rooted.convictions? That’s the question that Philip.Fernbach, a psychological scientist at the University.of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business, wanted to.explore. Fernbach and his colleagues wondered if.forcing people to explain complex policies in.detail—not cheerleading for a position but really.considering the mechanics of implementation—.might force them to confront their ignorance and.thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. They.ran a series of lab experiments to test this idea..They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in.their 30s—Democrats, Republicans, and.Independents—and asking them to state their.positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat.tax to a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions..The volunteers indicated how strongly they felt about.each issue and also rated their own understanding of.the issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to.write elaborate explanations of two issues. If the issue.was cap and trade, for example, they would first.explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is.implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could.hurt, the sources of carbon emissions, and so forth..They were not asked for value judgments about the.policy or about the environment or business, but.only for a highly detailed description of the.mechanics of the policy in action..Let’s be honest: Most of us never do this..Fernbach’s idea was that such an exercise would.force many to realize just how little they really know.about cap and trade, and confronted with their own.ignorance, they would dampen their own.enthusiasm. They would be humbled and as a result.take less extreme positions. And that’s just what.happened. Trying—and failing—to explain complex.policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about.being well-informed. They became more moderate in.their views as a result..Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a.policy is not the same as trying to sell that policy..In fact, talking about one’s views can often.strengthen them. Fernbach believes it’s the slow,.cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that.changes people’s judgments, but he wanted to check.this in another experiment. This one was very similar.to the first, but some volunteers, instead of.explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it..The results were clear. Those who simply listed.reasons for their positions—articulating their.values—were less shaken in their views. They.continued to think they understood the policies in.their complexity, and, notably, they remained.extreme in their passion for their positions..Polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are.unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out.information that bolsters their views, often without.knowing it. They also process new information in.biased ways, and they hang out with people like.themselves. All of these psychological forces increase.political extremism, and no simple measure will.change that. But forcing the candidates to provide.concrete and elaborate plans might be a start; it gives.citizens a starting place.
Question: Based on the passage, which action would most likely reducepolitical extremism among the citizenry?
Choices:
  A: Forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions
  B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held
  C: Promoting awareness of charities that provide opportunities to donate money to worthy but underfunded causes
  D: Hosting events that encourage people who hold opposing points of view to interact with one another
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the idea that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. The exercise would force many to realize how little they know about certain policy issues, and humbled by their own ignorance, they would take less extreme positions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses an experiment that tested the impact of forcing people to explain complex policies in detail, which led many to realize how little they knew about the issue and become more moderate in their views.
  A: Forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions is not discussed in the passage.
  B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held is not discussed in the passage as an action that would reduce political extremism among the citizenry, but a similar action was tested in the lab experiment described in the passage.
  C: Promoting awareness of charities that provide opportunities to donate money to worthy but underfunded causes is not discussed in the passage as an action that would reduce political extremism among the citizenry.
  D: Hosting events that encourage people who hold opposing points of view to interact with one another is not discussed in the passage as an action that would reduce political extremism among the citizenry, although it may lead to greater understanding and empathy between individuals of different political views. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the problem of political polarization and extreme beliefs that are not based on a true understanding of complex policies.
  The author suggests that forcing individuals to explain complex policies in detail, which would force them to confront their ignorance, might weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The author also suggests that polarization tends to reinforce itself, as people seek out information that bolsters their existing views, process new information in biased ways, and associate with like-minded individuals.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: Based on the passage, requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held would be the action that could most likely reduce political extremism among the citizenry. The experiments described in the passage showed that forcing individuals to explain complex policies in detail weakened their extreme beliefs and made them more moderate in their views. Therefore, requiring politicians to explain their policies in a detailed and concrete manner could potentially have a similar effect on voters, encouraging them to base their views on a true understanding of the issues rather than simple, automatic, and misguided thinking that reinforces their existing beliefs.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses an experiment conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues from the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business.
  The experiment involved asking volunteers to explain in detail complex policies without giving value judgments about the policy or the environment or business.
  The aim was to force the volunteers to confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The volunteers who explained complex policies in detail became more moderate in their views as they realized how little they actually knew about the policies.
  On the other hand, those who listed reasons for their positions without explaining policies in detail remained extreme in their passion for their positions.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study where volunteers were asked to explain complex policies in detail, not just state their positions, and this led them to confront their own ignorance and take less extreme positions.
  A: The passage does not mention forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions as a way to reduce political extremism.
  B: The passage suggests that requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail might help, as this could give citizens a starting place to think more critically about the issues and potentially reduce extremism.
  C: The passage does not mention promoting awareness of charities as a way to reduce political extremism.
  D: The passage does not mention hosting events that encourage people who hold opposing points of view to interact with one another as a way to reduce political extremism.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: Which statement best describes the relationship between the two passages?
Choices:
  A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
  B: Passage 2 explains the scientific question addressed by the central hypothesis developed in Passage 1.
  C: Passage 2 discusses possible implications of the central hypothesis summarized in Passage 1.
  D: Passage 2 identifies evidence in favor of the central hypothesis advanced in Passage 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes research suggesting that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, which caused temperatures to plunge and the near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large mammals. It also describes the evidence that supports the theory that the debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact.
  Passage 2 describes a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that questions the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which proponents of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis have reported evidence for a cosmic collision. The study argues that when the quality and accuracy of the dating is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, and that the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes a hypothesis stating that a comet or asteroid exploded over the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, causing a millennium-long cooling period, an extinction of the Clovis hunters, and an almost-simultaneous extinction of large mammals.
  Passage 2 describes a critique of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. The critique argues that when the quality and accuracy of dating for sites said to contain evidence of cosmic collisions (including the Clovis artifacts) are examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a hypothesis that suggests that a comet or asteroid impact caused a cooling period and the extinction of Clovis hunters and large mammals around 13,000 years ago. The hypothesis is based on geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers.
  Passage 2 presents a critique of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which is the central hypothesis described in Passage 1. It argues that the dating evidence is weak and that the supposed impact fails on both theoretical and empirical grounds.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes the central hypothesis that a comet or asteroid exploded on or above the northern ice cap around 13,000 years ago, causing debris to shower across North America, resulting in the extinction of large mammals and the Clovis hunters, as well as a millennium-long cooling known as the Younger Dryas.
  Passage 2 presents a critique of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, claiming that the deposits of iridium, nanodiamonds, and magnetic particles previously cited as evidence for the hypothesis are not reliable indicators, and that the dating of 29 archaeological sites previously cited as evidence is based on questionable methods.

Action: Answer("A")  
The best statement that describes the relationship between the two passages is A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a hypothesis that suggests a comet or asteroid impact caused multiple climate and ecological changes around 13,000 years ago. The hypothesis is supported by multiple studies presenting geochemical evidence in the form of debris and sedimentary layers in North America. However, it is also presented as controversial, as other hypotheses could explain each of the events.
  Passage 2 presents new evidence that critiques the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which is the central hypothesis in Passage 1. The team led by David Meltzer examines the dating of 29 sites around the world in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision. They argue that only three of the 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, and the rest were either earlier or later by hundreds or thousands of years.

Topic: English
Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden  with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are 5 the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the10 procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those15 doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty20 years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that25 makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively30 no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us35 then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old40 family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so 45 long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The0 questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that55 procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will60 object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men65 have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our70 brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the75 gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this "civilization" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in80 them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

Topic: English
Context: Another man might have thrown up his.hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters.acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with.Line satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of.a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course.knew that he must proliferate his sources of.revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni.for tending the tube wells would not even begin to.suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off.a condemned electric motor—condemned by him..He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at.the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken.radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not.demur even when asked to fix watches, though that.enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned.him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took.apart ever kept time again..K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived.mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,.Nawab would place himself night and day at the door.leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled.grove of ancient banyan trees where the old.farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator.glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the.household machinery, the air conditioners, water.heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an.engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer.in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he.almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the.same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and.lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in.Lahore..Harouni of course became familiar with this.ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on.his tours of inspection, but morning and night could.be found standing on the master bed rewiring the.light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water.heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the.psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say.a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his.nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him.to go ahead..“Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to.the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube.wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is.but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have.earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to.show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties.as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive.me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud.hunger within than disgrace in the light of day..Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”.The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of.speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at.his nails and waited for the breeze to stop..“What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”.Unauthorized copying or reuse of any part of this page is illegal. **22 CONTINUE**.“Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your.service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,.on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the.many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery.fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a.bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I.first had the good fortune to enter your employment..I beg you, sir, let me go.”.“And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing.that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly.care one way or the other, except that it touched on.his comfort—a matter of great interest to him..“Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could.somehow limp along, at least until I train up some.younger man.”.The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt.expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the.disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a.brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even.managed to extract an allowance for gasoline..The motorcycle increased his status, gave him.weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and.asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he.knew absolutely nothing. He could now range.further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,.now he could spend every night with his wife, who.had begged to live not on the farm but near her.family in Firoza, where also they could educate at.least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road.ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way.to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni.lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new.machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every.knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,.seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial.wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to.whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears.almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his.arrival.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Voters need to understand the prosaic details of.complex policies. Most have staked out positions on.these issues, but they are not often reasoned.positions, which take hard intellectual work. Most.citizens opt instead for simplistic explanations,.assuming wrongly that they comprehend the nuances.of issues..Psychological scientists have a name for this.easy, automatic, simplistic thinking: the illusion of.explanatory depth. We strongly believe that we.understand complex matters, when in fact we are.clueless, and these false and extreme beliefs.shape our preferences, judgments, and actions—.including our votes..Is it possible to shake such deep-rooted.convictions? That’s the question that Philip.Fernbach, a psychological scientist at the University.of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business, wanted to.explore. Fernbach and his colleagues wondered if.forcing people to explain complex policies in.detail—not cheerleading for a position but really.considering the mechanics of implementation—.might force them to confront their ignorance and.thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. They.ran a series of lab experiments to test this idea..They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in.their 30s—Democrats, Republicans, and.Independents—and asking them to state their.positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat.tax to a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions..The volunteers indicated how strongly they felt about.each issue and also rated their own understanding of.the issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to.write elaborate explanations of two issues. If the issue.was cap and trade, for example, they would first.explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is.implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could.hurt, the sources of carbon emissions, and so forth..They were not asked for value judgments about the.policy or about the environment or business, but.only for a highly detailed description of the.mechanics of the policy in action..Let’s be honest: Most of us never do this..Fernbach’s idea was that such an exercise would.force many to realize just how little they really know.about cap and trade, and confronted with their own.ignorance, they would dampen their own.enthusiasm. They would be humbled and as a result.take less extreme positions. And that’s just what.happened. Trying—and failing—to explain complex.policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about.being well-informed. They became more moderate in.their views as a result..Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a.policy is not the same as trying to sell that policy..In fact, talking about one’s views can often.strengthen them. Fernbach believes it’s the slow,.cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that.changes people’s judgments, but he wanted to check.this in another experiment. This one was very similar.to the first, but some volunteers, instead of.explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it..The results were clear. Those who simply listed.reasons for their positions—articulating their.values—were less shaken in their views. They.continued to think they understood the policies in.their complexity, and, notably, they remained.extreme in their passion for their positions..Polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are.unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out.information that bolsters their views, often without.knowing it. They also process new information in.biased ways, and they hang out with people like.themselves. All of these psychological forces increase.political extremism, and no simple measure will.change that. But forcing the candidates to provide.concrete and elaborate plans might be a start; it gives.citizens a starting place.
Question: The passage implies that when conducting his laboratorywork, Fernbach would have been most surprised by which finding?
Choices:
  A: No link was found between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions.
  B: After volunteers were asked to analyze a complicated political issue, their understanding of it did not increase.
  C: When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
  D: When volunteers were asked questions about complex issues, those with the most extreme views were found to have the best overall understanding of them.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses laboratory experiments conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues to explore the effect of detailed policy analysis on people's political views.
  A: The passage does not address whether there is a link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of people's positions.
  B: The passage does not suggest that Fernbach would have been surprised if volunteers' understanding of issues did not increase after analyzing them.
  C: The passage suggests that Fernbach would have been surprised by the finding that simply listing reasons for endorsing a policy did not lead to changes in people's views.
  D: The passage does not suggest that those with the most extreme views had the best understanding of complex issues.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a series of lab experiments designed to test whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The volunteers were asked to write elaborate explanations of the mechanics of a policy, rather than expressing their values and opinions about it.
  Fernbach believed that this exercise would force many to realize just how little they really know about the policy, and confronted with their own ignorance, they would take less extreme positions.
Action: Answer("C")  
The passage implies that when conducting his laboratory work, Fernbach would have been most surprised by the finding that when volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise. This is shown in the passage when it says, "Those who simply listed reasons for their positions—articulating their values—were less shaken in their views. They continued to think they understood the policies in their complexity, and, notably, they remained extreme in their passion for their positions." Therefore, the correct answer is (C).
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Philip Fernbach conducted laboratory experiments to test if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  Volunteers were asked to write elaborate explanations of two issues including the mechanics of each policy.
  The exercise aimed to force many to realize just how little they really know about a policy, and confronted with their own ignorance, they would dampen their own enthusiasm, becoming more moderate in their views as a result.
  Fernbach believes that the slow, cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that changes people’s judgments, but he wanted to check this in another experiment.
  In the second experiment, some volunteers, instead of explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it. 
  
Analysis:
  The question asks which finding would have surprised Fernbach the most when conducting his laboratory work. This means it is asking which result was unexpected or contrary to what Fernbach was testing or expected to observe.
  A: No link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions is not surprising as the study was not investigating the relationship between these factors.
  B: The understanding of the volunteers was not expected to increase after they were asked to analyze a complicated political issue. They were asked to write detailed explanations of the policy, not to read or learn about it from any external sources.
  C: The finding that the exercise did not affect volunteers' views when they were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy would be surprising as these volunteers were not required to explain the mechanics of the policy, which was the key factor in the first experiment.
  D: The finding that those with the most extreme views were found to have the best overall understanding of complex issues was not investigated in the study. It is not mentioned in the passage, and it is not consistent with the findings reported.

Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a series of lab experiments conducted by Fernbach and his colleagues.
  The experiments involved recruiting volunteers with varying political affiliations and asking them to state their positions on various issues.
  In one experiment, volunteers were asked to write elaborate explanations of two issues, focusing on the mechanics of implementation.
  After completing the exercise, some volunteers merely listed reasons for their positions, while others were asked to explain the issues in detail.
  The results suggest that being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a policy can undermine people's illusions about being well-informed and lead to more moderate views.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The passage suggests that when volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise. This is indicated by the statement: "Those who simply listed reasons for their positions—articulating their values—were less shaken in their views. They continued to think they understood the policies in their complexity, and, notably, they remained extreme in their passion for their positions." Therefore, the correct answer is (C).
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses an experiment conducted by Fernbach and his colleagues to assess the impact of asking people to explain complex political policies in detail.
  The experiment involved a group of volunteers who were asked to explain two issues and write elaborate descriptions of the mechanics of the policy in action.
  The idea was that many people would realize just how little they really know about a policy, and confronted with their own ignorance, they would dampen their own enthusiasm and become more moderate in their views.
Action: Answer("C")  
The passage implies that when conducting his laboratory work, Fernbach would have been most surprised by the finding that when volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise. The experiment showed that those who simply listed reasons for their positions were less shaken in their views, and they continued to think they understood the policies in their complexity and remained extreme in their passion for their positions. The experiment showed that articulating one’s values can often strengthen one’s views, and it is the deliberate analysis of the mechanics of a policy that changes people’s judgments.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage describes a series of lab experiments conducted by Fernbach and his colleagues in which they asked volunteers to explain complex policies in detail to see if doing so would weaken their extremist stands on the issues. The experiments showed that being forced to articulate the technical details of a policy undermined the extremists’ illusions about being well-informed and made them more moderate in their views. 
A: The passage does not mention any link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions. Therefore, it is not a finding that Fernbach would have been surprised by.
B: The passage does not mention whether volunteers' understanding of a complicated political issue increased or not, so this cannot be the finding that Fernbach would have been most surprised by.
C: The passage states that those who simply listed reasons for their positions were less shaken in their views, and notably, they remained extreme in their passion for their positions. This finding is consistent with the results of the experiment, so it is not the finding that Fernbach would have been most surprised by.
D: The passage does not mention anything about the relationship between the extremity of a person's views and their understanding of complex issues. Therefore, it is not a finding that Fernbach would have been surprised by.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses an experiment conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues to test if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. 
  The experiment found that when people were asked to write elaborate explanations of complex policies, they became more moderate in their views as a result.
  The experiment also found that when some volunteers were only asked to list reasons for their positions, they remained extreme in their passion for their positions.
Action: Answer("C")  
The passage implies that when conducting his laboratory work, Fernbach would have been most surprised by the finding that, when volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study in which volunteers were asked to explain complex policies in detail, which was found to reduce their extremist stands on those issues.
  A: The passage does not discuss whether there is a link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions. 
  B: The passage does not imply that Fernbach would have been surprised by this finding, but it suggests that volunteers' views were affected and generally became more moderate. 
  C: This answer choice accurately summarizes one of the key findings of the study. When volunteers were asked to list reasons for their positions, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise. 
  D: The passage does not suggest that those with the most extreme views had the best overall understanding of complex issues.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: A pair of recent studies suggests that although.industrialized nations may have benefitted from larger.cities, the same is not true for the rapidly urbanizing areas of.the developing world. In these parts of the globe, there really.might be such a thing as too much urbanization, too.quickly..The studies, by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez-.Pose of the London School of Economics, take a close look.at the actual connection between city size and nationwide.economic performance. Their initial study, from last year,.examines the relationship between economic development,.as measured by GDP per capita, and average metropolitan-.area size in 114 countries across the world between 1960.and 2010. To ensure robustness, it controls for variables.including national population size, physical land area,.education levels, economic openness, and other factors..The size of cities or metro areas across the world has.exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the.developing world growing much faster and much larger.than those in more developed nations. Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew.modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median.city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding.from 220,000 to 845,000 people. In 1960, 12 of the top 20.countries with the largest average city size were high-.income countries; by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the.developing world..Urbanization has historically been thought of as a.necessary feature of economic development and growth, but.this study finds the connection is not so simple. While.advanced nations benefit from having larger cities,.developing nations do not. Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every.additional 100,000 in average population among its large.cities over a five-year period. But for developing nations, the.addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year.period..In their latest study, the researchers found that.developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck.from smaller and medium-size cities. These countries see.the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion.of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people.or less. Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic.impact in larger countries. Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic.benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million.or more, according to the study. This makes sense:.Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play.host to knowledge-based industries that require urban.agglomeration economies..There are several reasons why megacities^1 often fail to.spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world..For one, the lion’s share of places that are urbanizing.most rapidly today are in the poorest and least-.developed parts of the world, whereas the places that.urbanized a century or so ago were in the richest and.most developed. This history has created a false.expectation that urbanization is always associated with.prosperity..Additionally, globalization has severed the historical.connection between cities, local agriculture, and local.industry that powered the more balanced urban.economic development of the past. In today’s globally.interconnected economy, the raw materials that flowed.from the surrounding countryside to the city can all be.inexpensively imported from other parts of the world..The result is that the connection between large cities and.growth has now become much more tenuous, producing.a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without.growth.”.The researchers used multiple variables to calculate a weighted average.city size for each country studied and reported the median of those.averages..(^1) Typically defined as cities with populations of over ten million people
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred from the passagethat a megacity’s economic impact on a country is
Choices:
  A: greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
  B: dependent on the types of companies located in the megacity.
  C: relatively equal for developing countries and high-income countries.
  D: neutralized by the economic cost of maintaining a megacity.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage mentions that larger developed nations benefit economically from larger cities, but for developing nations the opposite is true: larger cities are associated with lower economic growth.
  The passage also mentions that bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries because they are more likely to host knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies.
  The passage notes that having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the economic impact of different city sizes and how this impact varies depending on factors such as the level of economic development of a country, the proportion of its urban population living in smaller and medium-sized cities, and the total urban population of the country. 
  A: The passage does not suggest any relationship between a country's physical land area and the economic impact of a megacity.
  B: The passage suggests that the economic impact of a megacity on a country depends on the size of the country and the types of industries located in the megacity. For example, knowledge-based industries may require urban agglomeration economies that are only possible in larger cities.
  C: The passage suggests that the economic impact of a megacity is relatively equal or positive for high-income countries, but negative for developing countries. Developing countries tend to benefit more from smaller and medium-sized cities.
  D: The passage does not suggest that the economic impact of a megacity is neutralized by the economic cost of maintaining a megacity.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the economic impact of city size on a country's economic performance, with a focus on developing countries. 
  The study found that while larger cities in advanced nations benefit their economic growth, the addition of population to large cities in developing countries is associated with a decrease in economic growth. 
  Developing countries are found to benefit more from smaller and medium-size cities.
  The economic impact of a megacity tends to be greater in larger countries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The second study by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez- Pose found that developing nations see the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people or less.
  A megacity is typically defined as a city with a population of over ten million people.
  The passage mentions that having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more in larger countries.
  The connection between large cities and growth has become much more tenuous, producing a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without growth.”
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more, according to the study. Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries. Having a larger population among its large cities over a five-year period is associated with a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for advanced nations, but a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth for developing nations. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that a megacity's economic impact on a country is dependent on the country's size and level of development. 
  A: The passage does not suggest that the economic impact of megacities is related to physical land area.
  B: The passage suggests that the economic impact of a megacity is related to the country's size and level of development, but not specifically to the types of companies located in the megacity.
  C: The passage indicates that advanced nations benefit from having larger cities while developing nations do not. Developing nations experience a decrease in economic growth when adding 100,000 people in large cities, while advanced nations experience an increase in economic growth. 
  D: The passage does not suggest that the economic cost of maintaining a megacity neutralizes its economic impact on a country.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The researchers found that developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck from smaller and medium-size cities and see the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people or less.
  Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more, according to the study. This makes sense: Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play host to knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies.
  There are several reasons why megacities often fail to spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world. For one, the places that are urbanizing most rapidly today are in the poorest and least developed parts of the world whereas the places that urbanized a century or so ago were in the richest and most developed.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the economic impact of megacities on different countries and the factors that affect this impact.
  A: The passage does not mention that the economic impact of megacities is greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
  B: The passage suggests that the types of companies located in the megacity may play a role in the economic impact of the megacity on the country.
  C: The passage indicates that the economic impact of megacities is relatively equal for high-income countries and developing countries.
  D: The passage does not mention that the economic cost of maintaining a megacity neutralizes its economic impact.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more, according to the study.
  This makes sense, as bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play host to knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies.
  The passage does not suggest that a megacity's economic impact is greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
  The passage indicates that the globalization has severed the historical connection between cities, local agriculture, and local industry that powered the more balanced urban economic development of the past, producing a troubling new pattern of "urbanization without growth."
  The passage does not indicate that a megacity's economic impact is neutralized by the economic cost of maintaining a megacity.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that the economic impact of a megacity on its country is not the same across all countries.
  The passage also notes that advanced nations benefit from having larger cities, but developing nations do not.
  Cities in the developing world are growing faster and larger than those in more developed nations.
  Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every additional 100,000 in average population among its large cities over a five-year period, while for developing nations, the addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year period.
  Larger countries tend to benefit more from megacities than smaller countries.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

Question: An unstated assumption made by the authors about clover is that the plants
Choices:
  A: do not produce pyrethrums.
  B: are members of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  C: are usually located near wild-type honeybee colonies.
  D: will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage states that "we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on 25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection."

Analysis: The authors of the passage suggest that a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins, such as pyrethrums, may be a problem for honeybee colonies. They postulate that bees need to feed on pyrethrum-producing plants intermittently to defend against mites. The control colonies are only offered clover as a food source, so an assumption is made about the effectiveness of clover in providing the necessary anti-mite defenses.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage mentions that pyrethrums are produced by a group of flowering plants that include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species.
  The authors suggest that a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins like pyrethrums may be a problem for commercial bee colonies and that feeding on pyrethrum producing plants can help prevent mite infestations.
  The authors propose an experiment in which a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The authors assume that clover does not produce pyrethrums.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses that pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants naturally produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The article suggests that bees fed with a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins, including pyrethrums, may become susceptible to mite infestations, which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. The study proposed in the article would test whether offering honeybee colonies both pyrethrum-producing plants and a typical bee food source like clover was beneficial in preventing mite infestation.
  
Assumption: 
  The article suggests that clover is a typical bee food source. The article does not state that clover plants produce pyrethrums and does not suggest that members of the Chrysanthemum genus are the only plants that bees consume for nutrition.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The article mentions that pyrethrums are produced by a group of flowering plants that include Chrysanthemums and related species. 
  The article also mentions that the control colonies will be offered a typical bee food source such as clover.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The authors make the unstated assumption that clover (the typical bee food source offered to the control colonies) does not produce pyrethrums, which are potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. This is implied by the fact that the article states that intermittent feeding on pyrethrum-producing plants is necessary for bee colonies to be able to defend against mite infestations, and that bee colonies that are fed a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins (like pyrethrums) are susceptible to fatal mite infestations.
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage states that "bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees" and that "we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants". The study proposed in the passage involves offering some commercial honey bee colonies a number of pyrethrum producing plants as well as a typical bee food source such as clover. 
A: The passage does not state whether or not clover produces pyrethrums. 
B: The passage does not connect clover with the Chrysanthemum genus. 
C: The passage does not state that clover is usually located near wild-type honeybee colonies. 
D: The author only suggests that there may be a deficiency in the diet of bees that prevents them from obtaining anti-mite toxins, and proposes the trial where some colonies are offered clover as a control food source, therefore, it is unlikely that the assumption is that clover will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")

  C: The passage does not state that clover plants are usually located near wild-type honeybee colonies.
  D: The passage only states that the control colonies will be offered clover as a typical bee food source, but it does not suggest that clover will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage mentions that pyrethrums are produced by a group of flowering plants that include Chrysanthemum species, and that these plants provide a natural defense against Varroa mites. 
  The authors suggest that commercial honey bee colonies that are fed monocrops may be susceptible to mite infestations due to a diet deficient in pyrethrums, and that feeding these colonies pyrethrum-producing plants could help prevent mite infestations.
  The authors propose a trial where a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered pyrethrum-producing plants and a typical bee food source like clover, while control colonies are offered only clover. Mites would then be introduced to each hive to observe the effect on the experimental and control colonies.
  
Assumption:

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What can reasonably be inferred about the reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study?
Choices:
  A: The ibises were well acquainted with their migration route.
  B: Usherwood knew the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration.
  C: The ibises have a body design that is similar to that of a modern airplane.
  D: The ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.
Response 0:
Knowledge:

The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species.
  
A: The passage does not provide any information to infer that the ibises were well acquainted with their migration route.
B: The passage provides information that the ibises carried data loggers, but it does not indicate that they were familiar with carrying them during migration.
C: The passage provides information that the ibises carefully positioned their wingtips and sync their flapping to catch the preceding bird's updraft during flight. However, it does not provide any information to infer that the ibises have a body design that is similar to that of a modern airplane.
D: The passage provides information that the study took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises to Europe. It also mentions that a flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers that allowed scientists to determine each bird's flight position and timing of the wing flaps. However, it does not provide enough information to infer that the ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.
Action: Answer("Unknown")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The study focused on northern bald ibises.
  The scientists used hand-raised birds that were part of a project to reintroduce them to Europe.
  The researchers used data loggers to track the birds' flight positions and wing flapping timing.
  The study found that the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies.
  The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The study of ibises involved showing hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy using a microlight plane and data loggers. 
  The ibises were carefully positioning their wingtips and synchronizing their flapping to save energy during flight.
A: There is no information in the passage to suggest that the ibises were already familiar with their migration route.
B: The passage only states that the data loggers were specially built by Usherwood and his lab, not that the ibises were previously familiar with carrying them.
C: The passage suggests that birds in a V formation can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down, but it does not specify that ibises have a body design similar to that of a modern airplane.
D: The passage does not provide information about the accessibility of the ibises for Usherwood and his team to track and observe. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The study used northern bald ibises to investigate the reasons why birds fly in V-formation and how they synchronize their wing beats. Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. The flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab to determine each bird's flight position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species.
A: The passage mentions that the ibises were hand-raised and that the scientists reintroduced them to Europe to study their migration route. However, it does not suggest that the ibises were well acquainted with their migration route. 
B: The passage mentions that the ibises carried data loggers, but it does not suggest that Usherwood knew the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration. 
C: The passage mentions that the birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down, but it does not suggest that the ibises have a body design that is similar to that of a modern airplane. 
D: The passage mentions that the study took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises to Europe and that the flock of ibises carried data loggers. The passage does not indicate that the ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood or his team to track and observe, but rather that they used a microlight plane to show the birds their ancestral migration route and that the birds carried the data loggers.

Topic: English
Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar. In 1789,.the French formed a new governmental body known as the.National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of.political and social change known as the French Revolution..To make a government requires no great.prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience,.and the work is done. To give freedom is still more.easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to.let go the rein. But to form a free government, that is,.to temper together these opposite elements of liberty.and restraint in one consistent work, requires much.thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and.combining mind. This I do not find in those who.take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they.are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather.believe it. It would put them below the common level.of human understanding. But when the leaders.choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of.popularity, their talents, in the construction of the.state, will be of no service. They will become.flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not.the guides, of the people. If any of them should.happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly.limited and defined with proper qualifications, he.will be immediately outbid by his competitors who.will produce something more splendidly popular..Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause..Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of.cowards, and compromise as the prudence of.traitors, until, in hopes of preserving the credit which.may enable him to temper and moderate, on some.occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become.active in propagating doctrines and establishing.powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose.at which he ultimately might have aimed..But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all.that deserves commendation in the indefatigable.labors of this Assembly? I do not deny that, among.an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some.good may have been done. They who destroy.everything certainly will remove some grievance..They who make everything new have a chance that.they may establish something beneficial. To give.them credit for what they have done in virtue of the.authority they have usurped, or which can excuse.them in the crimes by which that authority has been.acquired, it must appear that the same things could.not have been accomplished without producing such.a revolution. Most assuredly they might....Some.usages have been abolished on just grounds, but.they were such that if they had stood as they were to.all eternity, they would little detract from the.happiness and prosperity of any state. The.improvements of the National Assembly are.superficial, their errors fundamental..Whatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather.to recommend to our neighbors the example of the.British constitution than to take models from them.for the improvement of our own. In the former, they.have got an invaluable treasure. They are not, I think,.without some causes of apprehension and complaint,.but these they do not owe to their constitution but to.their own conduct. I think our happy situation owing.to our constitution, but owing to the whole of it, and.not to any part singly, owing in a great measure to.what we have left standing in our several reviews and.reformations as well as to what we have altered or.superadded. Our people will find employment.enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent.spirit in guarding what they possess from violation. I.would not exclude alteration neither, but even when.I changed, it should be to preserve. I should be led to.my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I.should follow the example of our ancestors. I would.make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style.of the building. A politic caution, a guarded.circumspection, a moral rather than a complexional.timidity were among the ruling principles of our.forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being.illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of.France tell us they have got so abundant a share, they.acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and.fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus.fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct.attended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution.if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their.bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let us preserve.what they have left; and, standing on the firm ground.of the British constitution, let us be satisfied to.admire rather than attempt to follow in their.desperate flights the aeronauts of France.
Question: In the passage, Burke displays the greatest respect for which of the following?
Choices:
  A: The British voting public
  B: British leaders of past generations
  C: British citizens who are inspired by the French

Context: \section{Passage 1}Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the  countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between 5 the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people that $\mathrm{He}$ has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile ... working-folk10 of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes-the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a15 history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands ... a history of soldiers, who carried the flag20 across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century ... a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous 25 reasoning we find ourselves to-day....Think of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic's laws cover those islands with justice and safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans30 who will invade ... the Philippines when a liberal government ... shall establish order and equity there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who will build a . . civilization of energy and industry in Cuba, when a government of law35 replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!think of the prosperous millions that Empress of Islands will support when, obedient to the law of political gravitation, her people ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the40 Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great Republic!\section{Passage 2}If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the45 Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.The Filipinos do not need any encouragement 50 from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, "Give me liberty or give me death," he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or 75 spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so80 low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also85 calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: It is well known that some animal species use.camouflage to hide from predators. Individuals that.are able to blend in to their surroundings and avoid.being eaten are able to survive longer, reproduce, and.thus increase their fitness (pass along their genes to.the next generation) compared to those who stand.out more. This may seem like a good strategy, and.fairly common in the animal kingdom, but who ever.heard of a plant doing the same thing?.In plants, the use of coloration or pigmentation as.a vital component of acquiring food (e.g.,.photosynthesis) or as a means of attracting.pollinators (e.g., flowers) has been well studied..However, variation in pigmentation as a means of.escaping predation has received little attention..Matthew Klooster from Harvard University and.colleagues empirically investigated whether the dried.bracts (specialized leaves) on a rare woodland plant,.Monotropsis odorata, might serve a similar purpose.as the stripes on a tiger or the grey coloration of the.wings of the peppered moth: namely, to hide..“Monotropsis odoratais a fascinating plant.species, as it relies exclusively upon mycorrhizal.fungus, that associates with its roots, for all of the.resources it needs to live,” notes Klooster. “Because.this plant no longer requires photosynthetic.pigmentation (i.e., green coloration) to produce its.own energy, it is free to adopt a broader range of.possibilities in coloration, much like fungi or.animals.”.Using a large population ofMonotropsis odorata,.Klooster and colleagues experimentally removed the.dried bracts that cover the 3- to 5-cm tall stems and.flower buds of these woodland plants. The bracts are.a brown color that resembles the leaf litter from.which the reproductive stems emerge and cover the.pinkish-purple colored buds and deep purple stems..When Klooster and colleagues measured the.reflectance pattern (the percentage of light reflected.at various wavelengths) of the different plant parts,.they indeed found that the bracts functioned as.camouflage, making the plant blend in with its.surroundings; the bract reflectance pattern closely.resembled that of the leaf litter, and both differed.from that of the reproductive stem and flowers.hidden underneath the bracts. Furthermore, they.experimentally demonstrated that this camouflage.actually worked to hide the plant from its predators.and increased its fitness. Individuals with intact.bracts suffered only a quarter of the herbivore.damage and produced a higher percentage of mature.fruits compared to those whose bracts were removed..“It has long been shown that animals use cryptic.coloration (camouflage) as a defense mechanism to.visually match a component of their natural.environment, which facilitates predator avoidance,”.Klooster said. “We have now experimentally.demonstrated that plants have evolved a similar.strategy to avoid their herbivores.”.Drying its bracts early to hide its reproductive.parts is a good strategy when the stems are exposed.to predators for long periods of time: all the other.species in the subfamily Monotropoideae have.colorful fleshy bracts and are reproductively active.for only a quarter of the length of time. Somewhat.paradoxically, however,Monotropsis odorataactually.relies on animals for pollination and seed dispersal..How does it accomplish this when it is disguised as.dead leaf material and is able to hide so well? The.authors hypothesize that the flowers emit highly.fragrant odors that serve to attract pollinators and.seed dispersal agents; indeed they observed bumble.bees finding and pollinating many reproductive.stems that were entirely hidden by the leaf litter itself.

Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.Let every American, every lover of liberty, every.well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the.Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,.the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their.violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did.to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so.to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every.American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred.honor;—let every man remember that to violate the.law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to.tear the character of his own, and his children’s.liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by.every American mother, to the lisping babe, that.prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in.seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in.Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be.preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative.halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,.let it become thepolitical religionof the nation;.and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,.the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and.colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its.altars.....When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of.all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there.are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,.for the redress of which, no legal provisions have.been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do.mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,.should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they.continue in force, for the sake of example, they.should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided.cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be.made for them with the least possible delay; but, till.then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with..There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress.by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,.the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two.positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right.within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of.all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and.therefore proper to be prohibited by legal.enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition.of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable..Passage 2.Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey.them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey.them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress.them at once? Men generally, under such a.government as this, think that they ought to wait.until they have persuaded the majority to alter them..They think that, if they should resist, the remedy.would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the.government itself that the remedy is worse than the.evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to.anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not.cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist.before it is hurt?....If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of.the machine of government, let it go, let it go;.perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the.machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or.a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,.then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy.will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a.nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice.to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be.a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have.to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to.the wrong which I condemn..As for adopting the ways which the State has.provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such.ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will.be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into.this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to.live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has.not everything to do, but something; and because he.cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he.should do something wrong.....I do not hesitate to say, that those who call.themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually.withdraw their support, both in person and property,.from the government...andnotwait till they.constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the.right to prevail through them. I think that it is.enough if they have God on their side, without.waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more.right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one.already.
Question: In Passage 1, Lincoln contends that breaking the law haswhich consequence?
Choices:
  A: It slows the repeal of bad laws.
  B: It undermines and repudiates the nation’s values.
  C: It leads slowly but inexorably to rule by the mob.
  D: It creates divisions between social groups.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 explains the importance of obeying the laws of the country and having reverence for them. The author encourages Americans to pledge their loyalty to the Constitution and the laws of the land and to resolve any grievances in legal ways. The author believes that although bad laws should be repealed as soon as possible, they should be religiously observed while they continue to be in force, for the sake of example.
  
  There is no indication that the consequence of breaking the law in Passage 1 is a slowed repeal of bad laws, division between social groups, or leading slowly but inexorably to rule by the mob. On the other hand, the author emphasizes that breaking the law is to "trample on the blood of his father" and to tear the character of his own and his children’s liberty, which suggests that it undermines and repudiates the nation’s values. 

In Passage 2, the author argues that if the injustice requires one to be the agent of injustice to another person, then one should break the law. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 argues in favor of strict observance of laws and against their violation.
  A: The passage acknowledges that bad laws should be repealed, but argues that they should be observed until they are repealed.
  B: The passage suggests that violating the law undermines the nation’s values, as expressed in the Constitution and laws, and threatens the character and liberty of individuals and future generations.
  C: The passage argues against the use of mob law, which is not the same as breaking the law to protest injustice.
  D: The passage makes no mention of social groups or divisions between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: In Passage 1, Lincoln argues that violating the law violates one's duty to the nation, and undermines the foundations of liberty and progress. He argues that even if there are bad laws, one should still observe them for the sake of the common good. Only when such laws are intolerable should people work to change them. Breaking the law is not a solution and in any case, the intervention of mob law is never justifiable.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: In Passage 1, Lincoln argues that it is important to obey the laws of the country and not to violate them. He states that it is also essential to not tolerate their violation by others. He believes that reverence for the laws should be taught and enforced by different societal institutions. He does acknowledge that there may be bad laws that need to be repealed or grievances that need to be addressed, but he emphasizes that it is crucial to observe the laws that exist for the sake of the nation's political religion. In contrast to Passage 1, Passage 2 argues that there are unjust laws that exist and questions whether it is appropriate to obey them and wait for a majority to change them. The author of Passage 2 suggests that if a law requires someone to be the agent of injustice to another, then they should break the law.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: Based on Passage 2, Meltzer and his team relied on what evidence to challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis?
Choices:
  A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact
  B: The discovery of additional Clovis artifacts in a host of sites besides the 29 initially identified
  C: Analyses showing that nanodiamonds can occur in geologic formations lacking indications of extraterrestrial impacts
  D: High concentrations of iridium that have been found in sedimentary layers beneath the proposed impact layer

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.

Response 7:
Knowledge:
The article describes a study conducted to find out whether a Texas gourd plant could attract enough pollinators without attracting too many striped cucumber beetles, which are among the bad guys that can damage flowers and transmit the bacterial wilt disease. The researchers wanted to know if the Texas gourd's floral scent could be enhanced to attract more pollinators without also attracting more beetles.

A: This choice contradicts the article since it describes the opposite of what the researchers tested. The article mentions that the Texas gourd plant's main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent. Therefore, the assumption that Texas gourd plants could attract more pollinators by not having aromatic flowers is incorrect.

B: This choice is also incorrect since the article does not mention any targeted insects other than bees. The focus of the study was on balancing the attraction of pollinators and the avoidance of particular bad insects, specifically striped cucumber beetles.

C: This choice is correct. The article describes an assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to attract a lot of pollinators. The researchers planted 168 Texas gourd vines and made some of the plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers. They found out that pollinators did not prefer the highly scented flowers, and squash bees were indifferent, and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often than normal ones.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, "Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."40 He picked up a bird shape: "Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought." He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: "Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind."As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. "Look here," Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. "See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this." And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. "The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price."I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.

Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, in studying the Venus flytrap, Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of which type of evidence?
Choices:
  A: Mathematical models to predict the electrical charge required to close the Venus flytrap
  B: Analysis of data collected from previous researchers' work involving the Venus flytrap's response to electricity

I.wanted my talent to be the reason he wanted me back..“Indeed” was all he offered..What now to fill the suspended moment? His new.projects. I asked. His eyebrows leapt up in symmetrical.curves..“A Byzantine chapel for the World’s Columbian.Exposition in Chicago next year. Four times bigger than the.Paris Exposition Universelle. It will be the greatest assembly.of artists since the fifteenth century.” He counted on his.fingers and then drummed them on the desk. “Only fifteen.months away. In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that iron fragments in the asteroid belt are more likely to survive than rocky fragments due to their location in the core of differentiated asteroids. The hypothesis proposed by Bottke and his colleagues is that the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun than the asteroid belt, and were scattered into the asteroid belt due to gravitational perturbations from larger bodies. This would explain the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt, as well as the rarity of intact differentiated asteroids.
  A: This is an explanation for the missing mantle problem in differentiated asteroids, but it does not explain Bottke and his colleagues' hypothesis about the origin of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  B: This is the best answer. It accurately reflects Bottke and his colleagues' hypothesis that the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun than the asteroid belt, and were scattered into the asteroid belt due to gravitational perturbations from larger bodies.
  C: This option is not mentioned in the passage. Primitive asteroids are described as the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are different from iron meteorites.
  D: This option is close to the correct answer, but it is not accurate in stating that the fragments were knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with the parent bodies of primitive asteroids. The hypothesis is that the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun than the asteroid belt, and were scattered into the asteroid belt due to gravitational perturbations from larger bodies.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains that iron fragments have survived better than rocky fragments because iron lies in the core of a differentiated asteroid, whereas rocky material lies near the surface. Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last to be exposed. Iron is much stronger than rock, making it more likely to survive in the asteroid belt at least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the same size. Bottke and his colleagues explain the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt by asserting that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets. According to them, objects would have been more tightly packed nearer to the Sun, so collisions would have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt. Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions. Gravity perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.

  D: Choice D is consistent with the explanation of Bottke and his colleagues. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains that iron fragments from disrupted differentiated bodies have survived longer in the asteroid belt compared to rocky material due to the strength of iron. Rocky fragments have to survive in space for longer than iron ones, and the rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments due to bombardment while the iron core remains as a single piece. Primitive asteroids are no stronger than mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids, but many of the differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions. Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together, to a house divided against itself, and says that it is  contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.When did he learn, and by what authority does he proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that "a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand." Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a "house divided against itself." They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What does the author imply about pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation?
Choices:
  A: They communicate with each other in the same way as do ibises.
  B: They have the same migration routes as those of ibises.
  C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises.

Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a study of ibises that found they fly in a V formation and position themselves to catch the preceding bird's updraft, presumably to save energy during flight. 
  The study also suggests that other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, likely have similar aerodynamic benefits when flying in a V formation.
A: The article does not mention anything about communication among different species of birds.
B: The article does not provide any information about the migration routes of pelicans, storks, and geese.
C: The article suggests that other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, likely create a similar wake to that of ibises when flying in a V formation, which allows them to save energy during flight.
D: The article does not state that pelicans, storks, and geese expend more energy than ibises when flying in a V formation. Rather, the article implies that these birds likely experience similar aerodynamic benefits.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The article explains that ibises fly in a V formation to save energy during flight by catching the uplifting eddies caused by the preceding bird. 
  The article suggests that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, but smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. 
  There is no information provided about the communication between different types of birds during flight or how similar their migration routes are. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a study of ibises conducted to investigate why birds fly in a V formation during migration. The study found that birds positioned themselves carefully to catch the uplifting eddies created by the preceding bird's wings, presumably to save energy during flight. The article also mentions that models have estimated that birds save energy through drafting off each other, but birds create more unpredictable currents behind their wings than airplanes do. The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese. 
A: The article does not provide any information about communication among pelicans, storks, and geese during flight in a V formation. 
B: The article does not provide any information about the migration routes of pelicans, storks, and geese. 
C: The article states that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, because they create a similar wake to that of ibises. 
D: The article does not provide any information stating that pelicans, storks, and geese expend more energy than do ibises. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The article discusses a study of ibises that position themselves in a V formation and sync their flapping to catch the preceding bird's updraft and save energy during flight. The author notes that squadrons of planes save fuel by flying in a V formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. The study found that the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, but smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The article does not compare the communication methods of ibises to those of other birds.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The article suggests that birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation to save energy by drafting off each other.
  The study of ibises found that they carefully position their wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft.
  The findings of the study likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese.
  Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult.
Action: Answer("C")  
The article suggests that pelicans, storks, and geese create a similar wake to that of ibises when flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The study discussed in the passage showed that ibises position their wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft and save energy during flight.
  The study also found that birds position themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. 
  The article suggests that pelicans, storks, and geese are also long-winged birds that likely benefit from flying in a V formation.
  The article does not provide information about how these three types of birds communicate with each other, their migration routes, or their energy expenditure compared to ibises. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The article states that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The article also explains how ibises position their wings and sync their flapping to catch the preceding bird's updraft and save energy during flight. 
A: The article does not mention anything about communication methods of pelicans, storks, and geese during flight. 
B: The article does not compare the migration routes of pelicans, storks, and geese to those of ibises.
C: The article states that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese. 
D: The article explains that the ibises save energy during flight through careful positioning of their wings and syncing their flapping, but it does not say whether pelicans, storks, and geese spend more or less energy. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses a study of ibises that found they position themselves carefully in a V-formation and sync their flapping to catch each others’ uplift and save energy during flight.
  The article mentions that it is believed that migrating birds fly in a V-formation because it may make flight easier or because they are following the leader. 
  The article discusses how this behavior was studied by tracking a flock of juvenile northern bald ibises using data loggers to measure their flight positions and wing flaps.

Reasoning:
  The article suggests that the findings about the aerodynamics of ibises and how they position themselves in a V-formation likely applies to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese. 

Action: Answer("C")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses how ibises fly in a V formation to save energy during migration and positions their wings carefully to catch the preceding bird's updraft. 
  The aerodynamic estimates predict that birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies.  
  The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese because they have similar wingspan as that of ibises. 
  
Action: Answer("C")  
The author implies that pelicans, storks, and geese create a similar wake to that of ibises and can fly in a V formation to save energy during migration. This is because the aerodynamic estimates and the findings from the study with ibises are likely to apply to these long-winged birds as they have similar wingspans as that of ibises. However, the article does not discuss anything about communication or migration routes of these birds, and there is no information given to suggest that they expend more energy than ibises while flying in a V formation.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.
Question: Based on the passages, both authors would agree with which of the following claims?
Choices:
  A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
  B: Men often work selflessly for political change.
  C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.
  D: Political activism is as important for women as it is for men.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage 1, the author argues that women have an important role to play in society, but that their mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be different and peculiar from that of men. Women should seek to win everything by peace and love, and to make themselves so respected, esteemed and loved that people willingly yield to their opinions and wishes. The author argues that women are to accomplish this in the domestic and social circle, and that they should generally avoid throwing themselves into the attitude of a combatant or any party conflict that obliges them to exert coercive influences.
  In Passage 2, the author argues that human beings have rights because they are moral beings, and that the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature. The author argues that women have essentially the same rights and responsibilities as men, and that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open

Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.The brains of humans are conspicuously larger than the.brains of other apes, but the human-specific genetic.factors responsible for the uniquely large human.neocortex remain obscure. Since humans split from.chimps, which have brains roughly a third of human size,.the human genome has undergone roughly 15 million.changes. Which of these genetic tweaks could have led to.big brains?.About six years ago, scientists in David Haussler’s lab at.Howard Hughes Medical Institute discovered a gene called.NOTCH2NL. It’s a relative of NOTCH2, a gene that.scientists knew was central to early brain development..NOTCH2 controls vital decisions regarding when and how.many neurons to make..When the Haussler team looked in the official version.of the human genome at that time^1 —version 37—.NOTCH2NL appeared to be located in chromosome 1.near a region linked to abnormal brain size. Delete a hunk.of the region, and brains tend to shrink. Duplicate part of.it, and brains tend to overgrow..“We thought, ‘Oh, this is incredible,’” Haussler said..NOTCH2NL seemed to check all the boxes for a key role.in human brain development. But when the team mapped.NOTCH2NL’s precise location in the genome, they.discovered the gene wasn’t actually in the relevant.chromosomal region after all; the once-promising.candidate seemed to be a dud..“We were downhearted,” Haussler recalled. That all.changed with the next official version of the human.genome—version 38. In this iteration, NOTCH2NL was.located in the crucial region. “And there were three.versions of it,” Haussler exclaimed. Over the last three.million years, his team calculated, NOTCH2NL was.repeatedly copy-pasted into the genome, what he calls “a.series of genetic accidents.”.Genetic analysis of several primate species revealed that.the three genes exist only in humans and their recent.relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, not in.chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. What’s more, the.timing of these genes’ emergence matches up with the.period in the fossil record when our ancestors’ craniums.began to enlarge, Haussler points out. Together, the results.suggest that NOTCH2NL genes played a role in beefing.up human brain size..Passage 2.Modern humans have brains that are more than three.times larger than our closest living relatives,.chimpanzees and bonobos. Scientists don’t agree on.when and how this dramatic increase took place, but.new analysis of 94 hominin fossils shows that average.brain size increased gradually and consistently over the.past three million years..The research, published in The Proceedings of the.Royal Society B, shows that the trend was caused.primarily by evolution of larger brains within.populations of individual species, but the introduction of.new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones also played a part..“Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that.makes us human. It’s related to cultural complexity,.language, tool making and all these other things that.make us unique,” said Andrew Du, PhD, a postdoctoral.scholar at the University of Chicago and first author of.the study. “The earliest hominins had brain sizes like.chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since.then. So, it’s important to understand how we got here.”.Du and his colleagues compared published research.data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13.different species, beginning with the earliest.unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including.Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size.began to overlap with that of modern-day humans..The researchers saw that when the species were.counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a.common ancestor, the average brain size increased.gradually over three million years. Looking more closely,.the increase was driven by three different factors,.primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within.individual species populations, but also by the addition.of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones..The study quantifies for the first time when and by.how much each of these factors contributes to the clade-.level pattern. Du said he likens it to how a football coach.might build a roster of bigger, strong players. One way.would be to make all the players hit the weight room to.bulk up. But the coach could also recruit new, larger.players and cut the smallest ones..(^1) The reference version of the human genome goes through updates to.more completely map out each chromosomal sequence.

Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

Response 5:
Knowledge: Parsons believes that governments have a tendency to use their power to suppress the voice of discontent and that organized governments can be wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many. He also believes that political parties promise the people many things to get their confidence before coming to power, but once in power, they remain interested in staying in power, building a powerful machine to crush opposition and silence the voice of the minority. Parsons believes that the struggle for liberty should not be turned over to any political party for the management of social and industrial affairs but rather should be focused on the fullest development of individual units in society, which can never happen under government restrictions. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Parsons discusses his experience with the "Labor Question" and his disillusionment with the idea that governments could alleviate suffering of the oppressed.
  Parsons believes that governments use their power to silence the voice of discontent and that government concentrated power is always wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many.
  Parsons learned that it does not matter what fair promises a political party, out of power, might make to the people in order to secure their confidence, as the party in power will hold essentially the same views as the administration to remain in power at all hazards.

  A: The passage does not directly mention that the masses being well-versed in political history is a condition for positive social change.
  B: Parsons does not believe that political parties can bring positive social change. In fact, he does not trust any political party, regardless of its promises.
  C: The passage does not suggest that fewer political parties competing for people's votes would lead to positive social change.
  D: The passage implies that change occurs when the voice of the protesting minority cannot be silenced by prison, stake, or scaffold and when it is heard by the government. The individual vocalizing their concerns is an important part of this process, but more important is the collective pressure brought by the minority.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: Parsons expresses her critique of the state and the idea of entrusting any political party with the management of social and industrial affairs. She believes that governments use their power to oppress the majority, that they do not lead but follow progress, and that they tend to silence the voice of discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the machinations of the scheming few, who always did, always will and always must rule in the councils of the nation. For Parsons, in order to secure social change, it is necessary to create proper conditions for the fullest development of individual units in society, which can never be the case under government restrictions.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these "low-threshold" nerves "C-tactile," or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations

Choices:
  A: precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.
  B: relationship between body hair and CT fiber function.
  C: role played by CT fibers in the perception of pain.
  D: effect of microneurography on CT fiber signaling.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The 1999 study was conducted to determine what aspect of sensation the slow fibers could relay.
  The study involved a patient with an unusual nerve defect named G.L. who had lost responsiveness to pressure, but still had slow-conducting unmyelinated fibers intact.
  The researchers tested G.L. by brushing her arm gently, and she could still sense the pleasant sensation conveyed by slow fibers in hairy human skin.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The 1999 experiment aimed to determine the other sensory information that CT fibers could convey, besides responding only to a narrow range of subtle stimuli. 

Action: Answer("A")  
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a series of experiments conducted by Håkan Olausson and his colleagues to investigate the existence and function of slow-conducting, unmyelinated CT fibers in human skin. The experiments involve microneurography and gentle brushing of the arms to measure nerve signals and investigate the characteristics of CT fibers. One of the experiments involves a patient with an unusual nerve defect to investigate the role of CT fibers in conveying pleasurable sensations.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
It can be inferred from the passage that the intended goal of the 1999 experiment was to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey. This is evident from the passage when Olausson wanted to know if the same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the arm and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Furthermore, upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at different speeds to investigate the nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  In 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these "low-threshold" nerves "C-tactile," or CT, fibers, said Olausson, because of their "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks. Olausson wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the $60 \mathrm{arm}$ and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The experiment conducted in 1999 aimed to test if CT fibers can distinguish between different physical sensations and convey pleasant sensations. The article states that the researchers wanted to know if the same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the arm, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. They also wondered if that same fiber could convey a pleasant sensation.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The article describes a study conducted in 1999 to investigate the characteristics of slow "C-tactile" (CT) fibers. The study sought to understand whether these fibers convey a pleasant sensation and whether they could distinguish different types of stimuli.
  A: The article states that the researchers wanted to know if the slow nerve fibers could distinguish where the brush touches the arm, and whether it could discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. They also wanted to know if the same fiber could convey a pleasant sensation.
  B: The article mentions that CT fibers could only be found in hairy human skin, but there is no indication that the study aimed to investigate the relationship between body hair and CT fiber function.
  C: The article does not mention the role played by CT fibers in the perception of pain in the context of the 1999 experiment. The 1993 experiment suggested that slow fibers only respond to warmth or small painful shocks, but CT fibers were believed to be unresponsive to noxious stimuli.
  D: The article does not suggest that the 1999 experiment aimed to investigate the effect of microneurography on CT fiber signaling.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The 1999 experiment aimed to examine the characteristics of CT fibers and investigate whether they can distinguish different aspects of sensation such as texture, and whether they can convey pleasant sensations in humans.
A: This accurately represents the intended goal of the 1999 experiment.
B: The experiment did not intend to investigate the relationship between body hair and CT fiber function.
C: The experiment did not intend to investigate the role played by CT fibers in the perception of pain.
D: The experiment did not aim to investigate the effect of microneurography on CT fiber signaling.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses research into a type of nerve fiber called C-tactile or CT fibers. CT fibers respond to gentle touch and convey a more emotional or pleasurable quality of touch. Microneurography is a technique used to measure nerve signals in response to gentle brushing. 
  The passage states that the researchers wanted to know if the slow nerve could distinguish where the brush touches the arm, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather, and whether that same fiber can convey a pleasant sensation. 
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The article details experiments conducted by Håkan Olausson and his colleagues at Gothenburg University on the nature of sensory nerves, specifically slow-conducting CT fibers, which have an "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation and convey a more emotional quality of touch. The experiments used microneurography to measure the speed of nerve impulses and functional MRI studies to examine which areas of the brain activate in response to gentle brushing of the arm to activate CT fibers. In a later experiment, the researchers tested a patient with a nerve defect to confirm that CT fibers convey pleasurable sensations.
Action: Answer("A")  
Since the article details an experiment in which Dr. Olausson recruited a patient named G.L. to brush her arm and see which areas of her brain were activated by CT fibers, it can reasonably be inferred that one of the intended goals of the experiment was to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses an experiment conducted in 1999 to understand the precise nature of sensations that slow, unmyelinated nerves convey. These nerves, called CT fibers, are found only in hairy human skin and can detect slow, gentle tactile sensation but are unresponsive to noxious stimuli like pinpricks. The researchers wanted to know whether these slow nerves can distinguish where the gentle brushing occurs, whether they can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather, and whether they can convey a pleasant sensation. They tested a patient known as G.L., who had an unusual nerve defect and had lost responsiveness to pressure but could still sense warmth, to investigate these questions. They found that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. They specifically provide pleasurable sensations. The researchers used functional MRI studies to examine which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers brushed G.L.'s arm.

Context: A pair of recent studies suggests that although.industrialized nations may have benefitted from larger.cities, the same is not true for the rapidly urbanizing areas of.the developing world. In these parts of the globe, there really.might be such a thing as too much urbanization, too.quickly..The studies, by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez-.Pose of the London School of Economics, take a close look.at the actual connection between city size and nationwide.economic performance. Their initial study, from last year,.examines the relationship between economic development,.as measured by GDP per capita, and average metropolitan-.area size in 114 countries across the world between 1960.and 2010. To ensure robustness, it controls for variables.including national population size, physical land area,.education levels, economic openness, and other factors..The size of cities or metro areas across the world has.exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the.developing world growing much faster and much larger.than those in more developed nations. Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew.modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median.city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding.from 220,000 to 845,000 people. In 1960, 12 of the top 20.countries with the largest average city size were high-.income countries; by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the.developing world..Urbanization has historically been thought of as a.necessary feature of economic development and growth, but.this study finds the connection is not so simple. While.advanced nations benefit from having larger cities,.developing nations do not. Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every.additional 100,000 in average population among its large.cities over a five-year period. But for developing nations, the.addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year.period..In their latest study, the researchers found that.developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck.from smaller and medium-size cities. These countries see.the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion.of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people.or less. Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic.impact in larger countries. Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic.benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million.or more, according to the study. This makes sense:.Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play.host to knowledge-based industries that require urban.agglomeration economies..There are several reasons why megacities^1 often fail to.spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world..For one, the lion’s share of places that are urbanizing.most rapidly today are in the poorest and least-.developed parts of the world, whereas the places that.urbanized a century or so ago were in the richest and.most developed. This history has created a false.expectation that urbanization is always associated with.prosperity..Additionally, globalization has severed the historical.connection between cities, local agriculture, and local.industry that powered the more balanced urban.economic development of the past. In today’s globally.interconnected economy, the raw materials that flowed.from the surrounding countryside to the city can all be.inexpensively imported from other parts of the world..The result is that the connection between large cities and.growth has now become much more tenuous, producing.a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without.growth.”.The researchers used multiple variables to calculate a weighted average.city size for each country studied and reported the median of those.averages..(^1) Typically defined as cities with populations of over ten million people

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

Choices:
  A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
  B: unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs.
  C: inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality.
  D: at odds with the principles of American democracy.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the social changes that bring women closer to the same level as men. The author argues that women should be given distinct employment that fulfills their respective tasks in the best possible manner rather than having men and women do the same things.
  Passage 2 discusses how the substitution of the general principle of human relations from domination to equality applies to the relation between men and women. The author argues that every occupation should be open to all without favoring any gender.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Both passages discuss gender roles and the changes that need to be made to achieve greater equality between men and women.
  Passage 1 talks about how social changes that bring people closer to the same level and make superiors and inferiors more equal will raise women to be more equal to men.
  Passage 2 talks about how society needs to move towards a just equality instead of the dominion of the strongest, and that all occupations should be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The authors of both passages argue in favor of gender equality and social changes to bring women closer to parity with men. Passage 1 describes the American approach of recognizing differences between men and women while still pursuing gender equality, while Passage 2 argues for complete liberty of choice in all occupations without arbitrary limits.
  A: Both passages advocate for social changes in gender roles to bring greater equality between men and women, making choice A the correct choice.
  B: Neither passage argues that the changes in gender roles they describe are unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs, making choice B incorrect.
  C: While Passage 1 suggests that gender equality has economic advantages, neither passage argues that gender equality is inevitable or that there is a necessary economic drive toward it, making choice C incorrect.
  D: Neither passage argues that the changes in gender roles they describe are at odds with the principles of American democracy, making choice D incorrect.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passages describe changes in gender roles and the attitudes that accompany these changes.
  Both authors emphasize the idea of equality in society.
  Neither author suggests that these changes will be cost-free or without problems.
  In the authors' view, male and female roles are different but equally valuable.
  A: This choice accurately reflects the authors' perspectives. They believe that the expansion of rights and opportunities for women is part of a larger movement toward greater social equality.
  B: While the authors acknowledge that changes in gender roles may involve difficulties, neither articulates this view as the primary factor in their descriptions of society. 
  C: The authors do not suggest that the changes they describe are inevitable due to economic advantages, rather they argue that these changes are inherently valuable.
  D: Neither author expresses opposition to the principles of American democracy in their discussions of gender roles.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 argues that social changes which bring about greater equality between individuals will also raise women and make them more and more the equal of men. It argues that it is not by making men and women alike or coerced into doing the same things that greater equality should be sought, but rather by "carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman."
  Passage 2 argues that the relationship between men and women is "sure to be the last to throw off the old rule [of inequality], and receive the new." It argues for complete liberty of choice and freedom to pursue any occupation, and against arbitrary limits based on sex or class.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Both passages are discussing the relationship between men and women and the concept of equality between the genders.
  Passage 1 argues that social changes that bring father and son, master and servant, and superiors and inferiors nearer to the same level will raise women and make them more and more the equal of men; however, it cautions against the view that men and women should be made not only equal but alike in all things, which it sees as preposterous and resulting in weak men and disorderly women.
  Passage 2 argues that society has outgrown the old rule of men being the superior of women and that all human beings should be able to attain to the largest and highest sphere possible, which cannot be ascertained without complete liberty of choice. It argues against arbitrary limits on what individuals of a certain sex or class can do, suggesting that employments should be open to all and that the best person for the job will be determined through trial.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The two passages discuss the impact of democracy and equality on gender roles and suggest that social changes are necessary to bring about gender equality.
  A: Both authors suggest that changes in gender roles are part of a broader social shift toward greater equality.
  B: The authors do not suggest that the costs of changes in gender roles outweigh their benefits.
  C: The authors do not suggest that changes in gender roles are inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality.
  D: The second passage does not suggest that changes in gender roles are at odds with the principles of American democracy, and the first passage suggests that the Americans have applied the principle of political economy by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Both passages discuss the issue of gender inequality, specifically how society has historically been based on inequality between men and women, and how this is changing. 
  Passage 1 argues that social changes that bring people closer to the same level will raise women and make them more equal to men. However, it also criticizes the idea that men and women should be made completely equal and have the same functions, duties, and rights, because men and women have different characteristics and faculties that should be respected and put to use in different ways. The passage suggests that the Americans have a more nuanced approach to gender equality, which involves dividing the duties of men and women carefully so that each sex can fulfill their tasks to the best of their abilities. 
  Passage 2 argues that of all human relations, the relationship between men and women is the last to change from the old rule of inequality to a just equality, due to the strong emotions connected with it. The author believes that true equality means that every occupation should be open to all, without discrimination, and that the best individuals should be able to prove themselves in any occupation. The author suggests that any attempt to limit the abilities of individuals based on their sex or class is an injustice and a detriment to society.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Both authors describe how changes in gender roles are part of a broader social shift toward greater equality. They suggest that the traditional gender roles which have been established since ancient times and still present in their societies may be finally shifting towards greater equality. They argue that the shift will lead to a society superior to today's. They do not indicate that any of those changes would be unlikely to provide benefits outweighing the costs, that those changes are inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality, or that they are at odds with the principles of American democracy.
Action: Answer("A")

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: Based on the passage, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that
Choices:
  A: no genetic variations were common to all those finches that were not also common to all the finches that did not use that technique.
  B: those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
  C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
  D: there is probably not a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The researchers found that certain woodpecker finches developed a new tool-oriented behavior in a similar manner to their siblings that observed tool use in adult woodpecker finches.
  The researchers concluded that social learning is not necessary for the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker finches; instead, the developmental process seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components.
  Although the development of tool use is based on a very specific genetic predisposition, the researchers were able to demonstrate that non-social, individual learning does play an important role during the ontogeny of tool use in serving to improve the efficiency of this behavior.
 
A: The passage does not provide information about the genetic variations between the finches that used the novel levering technique and those who did not, so this is not a valid support for the researchers' conclusion. 
B: The fact that those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce its effectiveness does not support the researchers' conclusion about individual learning. 
C: The fact that the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially might suggest that social learning was not involved in developing the technique; however, this is not relevant evidence to support the conclusion that the woodpecker finches were displaying individual learning. 
D: The fact that there is probably not a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches is not relevant evidence to support the conclusion that the woodpecker finches were displaying individual learning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses an experimental study on woodpecker finches in which some chicks were reared with a tool-using model while others were not. The researchers found that even those who were not given the opportunity to observe tool use were able to develop tool-oriented behavior at a similar age as their siblings who had observed tool use. The researchers concluded that social learning is not necessary for this behavior to be acquired in woodpecker finches, and that it is strongly dependent on genetically fixed components. The passage also mentions that individual learning can enhance the development of tool use.
A: This statement is not relevant to the researchers' conclusion about individual learning in woodpecker finches.
B: This statement discusses the researchers altering the experimental conditions, which is not relevant to the conclusion about individual learning in woodpecker finches.
C: This statement suggests that the technique used by the finches who engaged in individual learning is difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially, which supports the conclusion that individual learning played a role in the development of this technique.
D: This statement suggests that there may not be a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the prior transmission of the specific technique used by the finches who engaged in individual learning, but it does not support or undermine the conclusion about individual learning in woodpecker finches.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Researchers found that young woodpecker finches acquire the ability to use tools regardless of social learning. Also, individual learning enhances the efficiency of this behavior. During the study, five individuals developed a new tool-using technique that deviated from the behavior performed by birds in the wild.
  
A: This choice is not relevant to the explanation of why the woodpecker finches were displaying individual learning.
B: This statement is not mentioned in the passage and does not support the claim that the new technique was a result of individual learning.
C: This statement suggests that the tool-using technique is difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially, which supports the claim that it was a result of individual learning.
D: This statement is not relevant to the explanation of why the woodpecker finches were displaying individual learning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study on how woodpecker finches acquire the ability to use tools, and concludes that while social learning is not necessary for the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker finches, individual learning plays an important role in improving the efficiency of this behavior. The researchers found that some woodpecker finches developed a novel levering technique that deviated from typical tool-using behavior, and that this technique was likely acquired through individual learning.
A: This choice is incorrect as it does not provide any information that supports the researchers' conclusion about individual learning and the levering technique.
B: This choice is incorrect as it describes a hypothetical scenario that is not mentioned in the passage.
C: This choice is correct as it explains why the researchers concluded that individual learning played a role in the development of the levering technique. The fact that the technique takes place inside a crevice and is difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially supports the idea that individual learning was involved in the development of this technique.
D: This choice is incorrect as it refers to a hypothetical scenario that is not mentioned in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The researchers found that young woodpecker finches can develop the ability to use tools regardless of whether they had the opportunity to watch adult woodpecker finches use tools or not. This suggests that social learning is not necessary for the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker finches. However, individual learning does play an important role in improving the efficiency of this behavior.
A: This choice refers to genetic variations and their commonality among finches that did not use the levering technique, which is not relevant to the question.
B: This choice suggests that the finches were not using the levering technique due to the altered crevices, which is not supported by the passage.
C: This choice explains how the levering technique is difficult to observe by other finches, which is not directly relevant to individual learning.
D: This choice discusses whether a naturally occurring circumstance would have favored the development of the levering technique and its prior transmission, which is not relevant to the question.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The researchers found that woodpecker finches display individual learning in developing the novel levering technique.
  A: The passage does not mention genetic variations in finches related to their use or non-use of the levering technique.
  B: The passage does not mention the researchers altering the crevices or the finches stopping their use of the technique.
  C: The passage suggests that the portion of the levering technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior is difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially, which supports the conclusion of individual learning.
  D: The passage does not address whether there is a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of the technique and its prior transmission.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage describes an experiment where woodpecker finches were split into two groups and only one group was allowed to watch a tool-using model. The experimenters found that even the young birds that did not have the opportunity to watch the tool-using model were able to develop tool-using behavior, albeit with some individual variations. 

A: This choice is not relevant to the question because it discusses the genetic variations among those who did not use the technique, rather than those who did.
B: This choice is not relevant to the question because it discusses the response of the finches to the alteration of the experimental setup, rather than the evidence supporting individual learning.
C: This choice is correct because it explains that the portion of the levering technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice, which makes it difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially. This supports the idea that those finches who used the novel technique did so through individual learning rather than social learning.
D: This choice is not relevant to the question because it discusses the likelihood of a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of the technique, rather than the evidence supporting individual learning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The researchers found that young woodpecker finches that were not given the chance to observe tool use in adult woodpecker finches, and thus never had the opportunity to watch the levering technique, developed this ability with similar aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were given the chance to observe tool use. It is suggested that reliance on social transmission during an association would be a highly risky endeavor in solitary woodpecker finches where parents are likely to be the only available tool-using models. The developmental process for the tool use seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components, but can be enhanced through individual learning. 
A: There is no mention of genetic variations among the finches that support or do not support the levering technique. This option is incorrect.
B: The passage does not mention whether the finches stopped using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices. This option is incorrect.
C: The passage mentions that the portion of the levering technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice, which is difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially. This supports the conclusion that individual learning played a role in the development of this technique. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
D: The passage does not mention whether there is a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of the levering technique and its prior transmission to those finches. This option is incorrect. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The researchers found that the young woodpecker finches developed the levering technique of tool use with similar aptitude, and reached distinct developmental steps that marked the appearance of the new behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were given the chance to observe tool use. The researchers concluded that individual learning played an important role in the ontogeny of tool use in serving to improve the efficiency of this behavior.
A: This statement is discussing genetic variations, and its relevance to individual learning is unclear.
B: This statement is discussing the effectiveness of the levering technique when the researchers altered the artificial crevices, and its relevance to individual learning is unclear.
C: This statement is relevant to the researchers' conclusion that individual learning plays an important role in the development of tool use, as it suggests that the new levering technique was developed by the birds on their own, rather than being socially transmitted from other finches.
D: This statement discusses the possibility of natural circumstances that would favor the development and transmission of the levering technique, but its relevance to individual learning is unclear.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The researchers investigated whether woodpecker finches use of twig tool is acquired socially. 
  They took whole broods and split them into two groups: half were reared with a tool-using model, and the other half were reared with a non-tool-using model.
  They found that young woodpecker finches can develop the ability to use tools even when they never had the opportunity to watch tool use.
  They concluded that social learning is not necessary for the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker finches.
  The developmental process of tool use is strongly dependent on genetically fixed components, but individual learning does play an important role in enhancing it.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The news is a form of public knowledge..Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the.health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a.Line private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge.increases in value as it is shared by more people. The.date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;.the causes and consequences of an environmental.disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular.law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all.examples of public knowledge that people are.generally expected to know in order to be considered.informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or.private knowledge, which is generally left to.individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is.promoted even to those who might not think it.matters to them. In short, the circulation of public.knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded.as a public good which cannot be solely.demand-driven..The production, circulation, and reception.of public knowledge is a complex process. It is.generally accepted that public knowledge should.be authoritative, but there is not always.common agreement about what the public needs to.know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and.how authoritative reputations should be determined.and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The.Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely.regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative.agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied.the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of.authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the.opinions of others.” As part of the general process of.the transformation of authority whereby there has.been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional.sources of public knowledge, the demand has been.for all authority to make explicit the frames of value.which determine their decisions. Centres of news.production, as our focus groups show, have not been.exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps.some news journalists feel uneasy about this.renegotiation of their authority:.Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the.“most read” lists on their own and other websites.to work out which stories matter to readers and.viewers. And now the audience—which used to.know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of.journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our.credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008)..The result of democratising access to TV news.could be political disengagement by the majority.and a dumbing down through a popularity.contest of stories (online news editor, 2007)..Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,.they amount to more than straightforward.professional defensiveness. In their reference to an.audience “which used to know its place” and.conflation between democratisation and “dumbing.down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular.mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by.experts, immune from populist pressures; and.disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive.recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down.opportunities for popular involvement in the making.of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional.claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are.right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every.institutional level in contemporary society,.scepticism towards the epistemological authority of.expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed.by several of our focus group participants, that the.news media should be “informative rather than.authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to.“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their.slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient.information” from which “we would be able to form.opinions of our own.”.At stake here are two distinct conceptions of.authority. The journalists we have quoted are.resistant to the democratisation of news:.the supremacy of the clickstream (according to.which editors raise or lower the profile of stories.according to the number of readers clicking on them.online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”.news; the demands of some audience members for.raw news rather than constructed narratives.
Question: The authors indicate that the public is coming to believethat journalists’ reports should avoid

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

  C: This is not the main point that Mill is making in Passage 2. 
  D: This is not the main point that Mill is making in Passage 2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses how the relations between men and women is the last to change from the old rule of dominion of the strongest to a just equality. 
  The resistance to this change is due to the strength of the emotions involved, and the tendency for feelings to cling to the forms and circumstances with which they are associated.
  The author believes that each individual should have complete liberty of choice and that employments should be open to all without favor or discouragement to any.
A: Although society was once constituted on the basis of inequality, the passage does not suggest that this is the reason gender roles are resistant to change.
B: The author describes how deeply entrenched emotions and tendencies towards clinging to the familiar are the reasons gender roles are resistant to change.
C: The passage does not suggest that legislative reforms can only indirectly influence gender roles.
D: The passage argues against enforcing arbitrary limits on the basis of gender and class. The author believes that this is detrimental to society and to individuals who are constrained in their abilities to contribute. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage 2, Mill argues that the relationship between men and women has been slow to change because it is intimate and connected to strong emotions. He argues that there should be no arbitrary limits on the occupations people can pursue.
  A: While society was organized around inequality in the past, there is no indication that Mill believes this is why gender roles are resistant to change.
  B: Mill argues that gender roles are resistant to change because of the strong emotions and intimacy involved in male-female relationships.
  C: Mill does not directly address the relationship between legislative reforms and gender roles and suggests there should be no arbitrary limits on occupations.
  D: Mill does not argue that gender roles benefit the groups and institutions currently in power.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 suggests that the relationship between men and women is the last to throw off the old rule of inequality and receive the new rule of equality. Traditionally, two persons could hardly co�perate in anything or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior. Mankind have outgrown this state, but the relationship between men and women was sure to be the last to receive the new change. Mill believes that there should be complete liberty of choice in determining what job or occupation to pursue and there should be no arbitrary limits based on gender or class.
  
  A: Although Passage 2 describes how inequality used to be the basis of the formal organization of society, it does not suggest that this is why gender roles are resistant to change.
  
  B: Passage 2 suggests that gender roles are slow to change because they are associated with the greatest number of strong emotions and are sure to be the last to receive the new principle of equality. This makes choice B a plausible answer. 
  
  C: Passage 2 does not provide evidence for legislative reforms being the only indirect way to influence gender roles.
  
  D: Passage 2 does not suggest that gender roles benefit the groups or institutions currently in power.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses the difficulty of changing gender roles in society because of their intimate nature and emotional connections with individuals.
  A: While this may be true that gender plays a role in the organization of society, the passage is discussing the resistance to change of gender roles.
  B: This is correct. Mill argues that the gender roles are the last to change because of the strong emotions and intimate connections associated with them which are highly resistant to change.
  C: The passage does not suggest this. It is mainly about the emotional factors and not the legislative factors that affect the change in gender roles.
  D: The passage does not mention this as the reason for the resistance to change in gender roles.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses the transition from a society based on inequality to a society based on equality.
  The passage argues that the relationship between men and women has been slow to change because it is intimately connected to strong emotions and has been associated with the old rule of inequality.
  The passage suggests that individuals should be free to choose their own occupations and that society will benefit from the best faculties of all its inhabitants.
  A: Passage 2 argues that society has transitioned from inequality to equality.
  B: This is the correct answer. Passage 2 suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because they are connected with strong emotions and have been associated with the old rule of inequality.
  C: The passage does not discuss legislative reforms as a means of changing gender roles.
  D: The passage does not discuss who benefits from gender roles in power.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 describes how all human relations are tending towards a just equality and how the proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest to which they are able to attain.
  Mill argues that gender roles are resistant to change because of the strength of the emotions and traditions associated with intimate relationships between men and women.
  A: The passage does not suggest that gender roles are resistant to change because they serve as a basis for the formal organization of society.
  B: Mill argues that gender roles are resistant to change because they are "connected with the greatest number of strong emotions" and "sure to be the last to throw off the old rule."

Topic: English
Context: Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,.but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the.doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that’s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they’d never go.below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,” he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green’s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent. Adding another could make.efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which.would cut in half the number of solar panels needed.for a given installation. The challenge is to produce.good connections between these semiconductors,.something made challenging by the arrangement of.silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden  with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are 5 the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the10 procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those15 doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty20 years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that25 makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively30 no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us35 then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old40 family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so 45 long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The0 questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that55 procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will60 object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men65 have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our70 brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the75 gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this "civilization" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in80 them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

Question: Do the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections?
Choices:
  A: Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.
  B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  C: No, because the data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder.
  D: No, because the data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that Varroa mites can increase bees' susceptibility to secondary infections.
  The table shows the occurrence of various pathogens in honey bee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
A: The data do suggest that infection with a pathogen causes colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder, but the question is specifically about whether the data support the claim that infection with Varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
B: The data show that for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder. However, the question is specifically about whether the data support the claim that infection with Varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
C: The data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder, but the question is specifically about whether the data support the claim that infection with Varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
D: Answer("B") The data do not directly indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites. However, the fact that the data show a higher percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder are infected with viruses and fungi, which are secondary infections that can be caused by mites, supports the claim that infection with Varroa mites increases bees' susceptibility to secondary infections.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Varroa destructor mites infecting honeybees and making them susceptible to secondary infections.
  The table shows the percent of colonies affected by different pathogens in honey bee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
A: The table shows the percent of colonies affected by different pathogens in honey bee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder, but it does not provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder. 
B: There is a correlation shown in the table between the percent of colonies affected by each pathogen and colony collapse disorder, but this does not necessarily mean that varroa mites increased susceptibility to these secondary infections. 
C: The data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder, but this is not relevant to the authors' claim about varroa mites. 
D: The passage indicates that honeybees are hosts to Varroa destructor mites, which feed on their hemolymph and can increase susceptibility to secondary infections. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, which feeds on bee hemolymph and can weaken bees and make them more susceptible to secondary infections.
  The table shows the percent of honey bee colonies affected by different pathogens in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
A: The data in the table provide evidence that infection with pathogens can cause colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder, but it does not specifically address whether varroa mites increase susceptibility to secondary infections. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
B: This choice is correct. Since the data show that for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater in colonies with collapse disorder than in colonies without collapse disorder, it suggests that something is weakening the bees' immune systems and making them more susceptible to infections, which could be due to mite infestation.
C: The data do not specifically address bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder, but that is not relevant to whether the authors' claim is supported or not, so this choice is incorrect.
D: The passage clearly states that Varroa mites are pathogenic large ectoparasites that can weaken bees and make them more susceptible to secondary infections. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, which feeds on the bees and can increase their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria, or viruses. 
  The table shows the percent of honey bee colonies affected by different pathogens, separated into colonies with colony collapse disorder and colonies without colony collapse disorder.
A: The data does not provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder. The table only shows the percent of colonies affected by different pathogens, but it does not prove causation.
B: The table provides evidence that colonies with colony collapse disorder have a higher percentage of colonies infected with all four pathogens, as well as individual pathogens, compared to colonies without colony collapse disorder. However, this does not necessarily prove that varroa mites specifically increase a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
C: The data is relevant to the issue of bacteria and colony collapse disorder, but this choice does not answer the question of whether the data provides support for the authors' claim regarding varroa mites and secondary infections.
D: The passage explains that honey bees are hosts to Varroa destructor mites and that these mites can increase honey bees' susceptibility to secondary infection. Therefore, the data in the table could potentially provide support for this claim if it indicates that honey bee colonies with Varroa destructor mite infestations have a higher incidence of secondary infection with fungi, bacteria, or viruses.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The authors claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
  The table shows the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together, for colonies with colony collapse disorder and for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  We know that varroa mites are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  Choice A is incorrect because the data does not show that one of the pathogens caused the collapse of the colonies with colony collapse disorder.
  Choice B is correct because the data shows that a higher percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by each of the four pathogens and all four pathogens together, which could suggest that the mites had weakened the bees and made them more susceptible to infection.
  Choice C is incorrect because the data includes bacterial infections and their percentages.
  Choice D is incorrect because we know from the passage that honeybees can become infected by varroa mites, which can increase their susceptibility to secondary infections. However, the table does not indicate whether the honeybees in each colony had been infected with mites.
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage explains that Varroa mites can increase bees' susceptibility to secondary infection, and that mites can indirectly lead to colony collapse disorder. The table shows the percentage of colonies affected by four types of pathogens in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
A: The data in the table do not provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
B: The data in the table show that for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder. This suggests that the presence of a pathogen may be related to colony collapse disorder, but it does not specifically address whether mite infection increases susceptibility to secondary infections. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.
C: The passage does not claim that bacteria are a cause of colony collapse disorder, so this choice is not relevant to the question.
D: The passage states that honeybees are hosts to Varroa mites and that mite infection can increase bees' susceptibility to secondary infection, which is consistent with the authors' claim. However, the table does not directly indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites. Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses that honey bees are hosts to Varroa destructor mites which can increase their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
  The table shows the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by various pathogens in colonies with colony collapse disorder and colonies without colony collapse disorder.
A: The data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen is associated with colony collapse disorder, but the table does not specify that the pathogen is caused by varroa mites.
B: The data show a higher percentage of colonies infected with all four pathogens (including viruses and fungi) in colonies with colony collapse disorder compared to colonies without colony collapse disorder. Therefore, the data provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites, which can increase susceptibility to secondary infection, could also increase the likelihood of colony collapse disorder.
C: The data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder, but the passage does suggest that bacteria could be a possible cause of secondary infection.
D: The data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites, but the passage states that honey bees are hosts to Varroa destructor mites.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the impact of varroa mites on honey bees and how it can increase their susceptibility to secondary infection.
  The table shows the percentage of honey bee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder that are infected by various pathogens, including viruses and fungi.
A: The data in the table provide evidence that infection with a pathogen occurs in colonies with colony collapse disorder, but it does not provide evidence that the cause of the disorder is infection with a pathogen.
B: The data show that the percentage of colonies infected with each pathogen is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder. This indicates that infection with a pathogen may contribute to colony collapse disorder, including secondary infections from mites.
C: The data provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder, but this is not relevant to the authors' claim about the impact of mites on honey bees.
D: The data do not directly indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites, but the passage states that varroa mites can increase susceptibility to secondary infection, which is what the authors' claim is about. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the negative effects of Varroa mites on honeybees.
  The passage also suggests that Varroa mite infestations can weaken honeybees and make them more susceptible to secondary infections with fungi, bacteria, or viruses.
  The table shows the percent of honeybee colonies affected by various pathogens, with and without colony collapse disorder.

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The data support the authors' claim because for each pathogen listed in the table, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder. This suggests that something (in this case, Varroa mites) is weakening bees and making them more susceptible to infections. Choice A is incorrect because the table does not provide evidence about whether a pathogen caused the colony collapse disorder. Choice C is incorrect because the data do provide information about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder, but that is not the focus of the question. Choice D is incorrect because the passage clearly discusses the negative effects of Varroa mites on honeybees.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Varroa destructor mites and their effects on honeybees.
  The data in the table show the occurrence of various pathogens in honeybee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder (CCD).
A: The data does not provide direct evidence that the pathogen caused the colonies to undergo CCD; it only shows the occurrence of pathogens in CCD and non-CCD colonies.
B: The data suggests a correlation between infection with pathogens and CCD; however, it does not provide specific evidence about Varroa mites increasing susceptibility to secondary infections.
C: The data includes information on bacteria, but this is not relevant to the question of whether Varroa mites increase susceptibility to secondary infections.
D: The data does not directly indicate whether honeybees had been infected with Varroa mites.

Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.
Question: Which choice best summarizes the passage?
Choices:
  A: A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job.
  B: A woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else.
  C: A woman impersonates someone else to seek revenge on an acquaintance.
  D: A woman takes an immediate dislike to her new employer.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: The passage describes Lady Carlotta's experience as she encounters a struggling horse and a sullen carter, which she helps. She then loses her train and is mistaken for a governess, whom she pretends to be. She accepts the job and the chapter ends with the introduction of Mrs. Quabarl and her children, as well as her expectations for Lady Carlotta as their governess. The best summary is that a woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job.

Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}

Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.

The author of Passage 2 asserts that the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection. Passage 2 argues that the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed but has not been adopted by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies because of a lack of understanding of or comfort with the new methods or because the old methods cast a more flattering light on their efforts. Passage 2 also argues that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers, and that the overall number of wild tigers, if even obtained, may not matter as much as monitoring the source populations using the best science available to track their numbers.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a new study by the World Wildlife Fund that suggests an increase in the number of wild tigers. The study notes that while there are challenges to accurately counting wild tigers, the increase could be attributed to successful conservation programs in certain countries. The increase in global tiger populations may not be reflected across all countries, as some have seen populations decline due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 discusses the evolution of scientific methods used to estimate tiger populations and range, as well as the need for governmental and non-governmental conservation agencies to adopt these methods.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,.but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the.doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that’s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they’d never go.below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,” he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green’s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent. Adding another could make.efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which.would cut in half the number of solar panels needed.for a given installation. The challenge is to produce.good connections between these semiconductors,.something made challenging by the arrangement of.silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.
Question: The narrator indicates that Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola are
Choices:
  A: similar to many of their peers.
  B: unusually creative and intelligent.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her50 reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an55 orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....Consider, sir, dispassionately, these60 observations-for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, "that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it65 was impossible to explain." If so, on what does your constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this70 country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman-prescription.Consider-I address you as a legislatorwhether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their75 own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift 80 of reason?In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be 85 useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.
Question: Which statement about striped cucumber beetles can most reasonably be inferred from the passage?
Choices:
  A: They feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
  B: They are less attracted to dimethoxybenzene than honey bees are.
  C: They experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease.
  D: They are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as a predator to Texas gourd plants that can cause significant damage, including the transmission of bacterial wilt disease.
  The passage notes that squash bees are among the main pollinators for Texas gourd plants.
  Theis and Adler's study found that extra scent did not attract more honey bees, but it did attract more striped cucumber beetles.
Action: Answer("D")  
The statement that can most reasonably be inferred from the passage is that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants, as they damage flowers and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  The passage explains that the Texas gourd vine's main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent. The scent includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant one that attracts squash bees is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the passage, the most reasonable statement that can be inferred about striped cucumber beetles is that they are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are. Although the passage does not explicitly state this, it describes how the researchers made some Texas gourd plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs inside their flowers, and that this attracted double the normal number of beetles to those flowers. This suggests that the beetles are also attracted to the compound that attracts squash bees.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants because they chew up pollen and petals, defecate in flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease, which can quickly destroy an entire plant.
  The passage mentions that the Texas gourd vine's main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which are attracted to the floral scent of the plant, which includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant compound that attracts squash bees is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
  The passage describes an experiment in which researchers made some Texas gourd plants more fragrant by using dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs on their flowers, but found that this actually decreased the number of pollinators and reduced the amount of fruit produced due to increased damage by beetles.
Action: Answer("D")  
The only statement that the passage supports about striped cucumber beetles is that they are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are (1,4-dimethoxybenzene).
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as bad for Texas gourd plants, as they chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease. 
  The passage also mentions that the scent of Texas gourd flowers attracts both pollinators (such as honey bees and squash bees) and the beetle pests. 
  The study discussed in the passage investigates the effects of enhancing the fragrance of Texas gourd flowers with the compound 1,4-dimethoxybenzene on pollinators and beetle pests.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the passage, it can be reasonably inferred that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that attract squash bees, as the passage describes how the fragrance of Texas gourd flowers attracts both pollinators and beetles, and the compound 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (which is abundant in the floral scent) is specifically attractive to squash bees.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Striped cucumber beetles are very bad for Texas gourd plants as they chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit bacterial wilt disease which can reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in mere days.
  Nina Theis and Lynn Adler conducted a study on how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles to Texas gourd plants. 
  The Texas gourd vine’s main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent. 
  The aroma includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
  More scent could well call in more beetles as well.

Inference:
  Striped cucumber beetles are very harmful to Texas gourd plants as they transmit bacterial wilt disease and damage flowers. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the negative impact that striped cucumber beetles have on Texas gourd plants.
  A: The passage does not state that striped cucumber beetles feed primarily on Texas gourd plants, nor does it suggest that they exclusively feed on this plant.
  B: The passage does not provide information about whether striped cucumber beetles are attracted to dimethoxybenzene.
  C: The passage states that striped cucumber beetles transmit the bacterial wilt disease, which can "reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in mere days." This implies that they experience significant negative effects as a result of carrying the disease.
  D: The passage states that striped cucumber beetles are among the "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants and that they "chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers," and transmit bacterial wilt disease. The passage also states that the aroma of Texas gourd plants attracts honey bees and squash bees, and that the most abundant compound in the scent (1,4-dimethoxybenzene) is the only one that lures squash bees into traps. However, the passage does not explicitly state whether striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in the scent that attracts squash bees.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage mentions striped cucumber beetles as being among the bad guys for Texas gourd plants. 
  They chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  The Texas gourd plant's main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees.
  The aroma of the Texas gourd plant includes 10 compounds, and the most abundant compound that attracts squash bees is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
  The researchers found that more fragrance did not attract more pollinators, but it did attract more beetles.
Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the passage, the most reasonable statement about striped cucumber beetles is that they are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are. However, the passage does not provide any information to support the other three statements.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the behavior and interactions of Texas gourd vines, honey bees, specialized squash bees, and striped cucumber beetles.
  A: The passage does not state that striped cucumber beetles feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
  B: The passage does not provide enough information to infer the attraction level of striped cucumber beetles to dimethoxybenzene compared to honey bees.
  C: The passage states that striped cucumber beetles transmit bacterial wilt disease, which can reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in a few days, suggesting that their negative effects on plants are significant.
  D: The passage states that striped cucumber beetles are bad guys for Texas gourd plants, as they chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease. It also states that only one compound in the Texas gourd scent lures squash bees into traps, which is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene. Therefore, it can be inferred that striped cucumber beetles are not attracted to the same compound as squash bees in the Texas gourd scent.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the behavior of striped cucumber beetles in relation to Texas gourd plants.
  The Texas gourd plant is pollinated by honey bees and specialized squash bees.
  The scent of the Texas gourd flower includes 10 compounds, and the most abundant compound that attracts squash bees is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
  Striped cucumber beetles are among the bad guys that attack Texas gourd plants by consuming pollen and petals, defecating in the flowers, and transmitting bacterial wilt disease.
Action: Answer("D") 
Inference: Striped cucumber beetles are likely attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are, since the passage states that the most abundant scent compound in the Texas gourd flower that attracts squash bees is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, which was used in the experiments to investigate the effects of increased scent on the behavior of bees and beetles.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants, as they damage flowers, transmit bacterial wilt disease, and reduce fruit development.
  The passage specifically mentions that dimethoxybenzene is the compound in Texas gourd scent that attracts squash bees, but does not mention whether beetles are attracted to it as well.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls and tables for four  down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass 10 sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other15 page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears.While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed 20 on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of25 Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important assembly ever convoked to discuss and 30 determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and 35 began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his right thumb) presided over the Congress, and40 Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented France.A party of four, two men and two women, came into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took possession of the center table nearest Lymie.45 The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against 50 the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup and shrimp 55 cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went back. 60 Otherwise he might never have known about the secret treaty concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress65 were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68 , but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair. Lymie closed the book and said, "I didn't think you 70 were coming."Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his75 scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button.80 Apparently he himself was not aware that there had been any change. He straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth85 finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of 90 the moon. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.
Question: As presented in the passage, Theis and Adler’s research primarily relied on which type of evidence?
Choices:
  A: Direct observation
  B: Historical data
  C: Expert testimony
  D: Random sampling
Response 0:
Knowledge:
The article describes the work of Theis and Adler, who conducted experiments on Texas gourd plants to investigate how to attract enough pollinators while not attracting too many beetles. These experiments involved manipulating the scent of the flowers and monitoring the behavior of pollinators and beetles.

A: The researchers spent hours observing the behavior of bees and beetles on the flowers, which involved direct observation. This suggests that direct observation was a primary type of evidence used in the research.
B: There is no indication in the article that historical data played a role in the research.
C: While the article does quote one chemical ecologist, Ian Baldwin, his testimony is not presented as evidence for Theis and Adler's research. Additionally, no other expert testimony is cited.
D: The article describes the researchers' manipulation of the scent of the flowers and monitoring of the behavior of bees and beetles, which does not suggest the use of random sampling.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage describes a research study conducted by Nina Theis and Lynn Adler on the problem of attracting enough pollinators for Texas gourd plants while avoiding attracting too many beetles. The study involved planting 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and making some plants more fragrant than others to investigate whether extra scent would attract more pollinators or more beetles.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.
Question: According to Passage 2, the wild tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed as a result of which factor?
Choices:
  A: Generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete
  B: Limitation to data that are more relevant in certain countries than in others
  C: Reliance on a new experimental tool that has not been thoroughly tested in the field
  D: Assumption of stability in population growth over time that is not supported by data

The author argues that while new methods such as photographic capture-recapture and large-scale occupancy modeling are more sound, older methods continue to be used and may yield flawed estimates of tiger populations. The author is skeptical of the estimate of 3,890 wild tigers offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum, as this estimate is based on the use of flawed methodologies that are statistically weak. The author suggests that only by using reliable counts can we set realistic goals for future growth, develop suitable strategies for meeting those goals, and measure the impact of our conservation efforts.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses the limitations of the methods used to estimate wild tiger populations in Asia, and suggests that some of the estimates offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed.

Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses the challenges of accurately estimating the wild tiger population, the adoption of new scientific methods to estimate the population, and the limitations of relying on outdated methodologies. It specifically critiques the population estimate presented by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum, describing it as based on flawed methodologies that include the use of weak extrapolations and field counts of spoor.

Action: Answer("A")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses how tiger populations are assessed using scientific methods, and how relying on outdated methods may provide inaccurate estimates. The passage suggests that the wild tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed.
  A: The passage mentions that the estimate relied on statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor, which could suggest an incomplete selection of evidence. However, this does not fully answer the question.
  B: The passage mentions that tiger populations are different across countries, which could suggest a limitation to data that is more relevant in certain countries. However, this does not fully answer the question.
  C: The passage suggests that new experimental tools are being used to estimate tiger populations, but it also mentions that these tools are being adopted slowly by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies due to a lack of understanding or comfort. This does not suggest that the estimate is flawed because of a reliance on new experimental tools.
  D: The passage mentions that the goal for population growth far exceeds what one would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried out using more rigorous techniques, and that there are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. This suggests that the assumption of stability in population growth over time may not be supported by data.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses the flaws in the methodologies used to estimate the wild tiger population by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum. It argues that the old methods are still being used despite the availability of new tools and that these methods are flawed and unreliable. It suggests that reliance on outdated and flawed tools can undermine efforts to save tigers, and that more rigorous techniques should be used to track tiger populations.

Action: Answer("A")  
According to Passage 2, the wild tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed as a result of generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete. The passage suggests that the estimates relied on flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor, and that their goal for population growth far exceeds what one would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore, there are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses the use of outdated methodologies in estimating tiger populations. The passage highlights the insidious effects of using flawed methodologies and statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of droppings, which can lead to over- or underestimations of tiger numbers.  The passage further asserts that counting tigers is a difficult task and that the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, but its adoption by governmental and non-governmental conservation agencies has not kept pace with the science. 
A: Generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete is addressed in the passage, as it criticizes the use of weak methodologies that can lead to flawed population estimates.
B: Limitation to data that are more relevant in certain countries than in others is not a factor that is discussed in the passage.
C: Reliance on a new experimental tool that has not been thoroughly tested in the field is not addressed in the passage. 
D: Assumption of stability in population growth over time that is not supported by data is not a factor that is discussed in the passage.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the  labyrinthine streets of London might have oncabbies' brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to beinvolved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies-a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The moreyears a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.The brain is a mutable organ, capable-within limits-of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known asneuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structurewas more or less static. Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.After her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with ElizabethValentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the Londoncabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners  and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical 45 differences in the brains of the memory champs, evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural50 difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. What's more, on every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes' scores came back well within the normal range. The 55 memory champs weren't smarter, and they didn't have special brains.But there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the researchers looked at which parts of the 60 brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry. According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be 65 working in overdrive for the mental athletes.Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial70 navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn't seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in 75 their mind's eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating like London cabbies when they're supposed to be remembering the shapes of snowflakes?Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes 80 to describe exactly what was going through their minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said they were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial85 journeys. They weren't doing this automatically, or because it was an inborn talent they'd nurtured since childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural activity that Maguire's fMRIs turned up were the result of training and practice

Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Large competitors are often viewed as a major.threat for startups and small companies; big.companies have more financial resources and greater.scale, market power and brand awareness than.smaller ones. However, our research finds that a.smaller brand can actually benefit if consumers can.see the competitive threat it faces from a larger.organization..When a U.S.-based ice cream chain with about 1,400 stores moved within 50 steps of a J.P. Licks ice.cream store in Newton, Massachusetts, some people.expected that J.P. Licks, a small, locally owned.company, would be beaten out of the Newton market..But consumers rallied around J.P. Licks, and the.national chain later closed its nearby location. When.the owner of the Los Angeles-based coffee store chain.The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf could not stop a large.coffee shop chain from moving in next door, he was.surprised to see his sales shoot up—so much so that.he started proactively colocating new stores next to.large chain ones..These examples are not anomalies. In six lab and.field studies, we explored the effects of having a large,.dominant competitor and found that highlighting a.large competitor’s size and close proximity can help.smaller brands, instead of harming them. Compared.to when they are in competition with brands that are.similar to them in size or when consumers view them.outside of a competitive context, small brands see.consumer support go up when they are faced with a.competitive threat from large brands. This support.translates into higher purchase intention, more.purchases and more favorable online reviews..As part of our research, we conducted a field study.at an independent bookstore in Cambridge,.Massachusetts. Upon entering the bookstore, 163.prospective shoppers were exposed to one of three.versions of an in-store ad, emphasizing either the.store’s large competitors, small competitors or no.competition. Shoppers who read the “large.competitors” version were told that the store’s main.competitors are large corporations that have the.ability to put small businesses such as this bookstore.out of business. The “small competitors” version.indicated the store’s main competitors are other.locally owned small bookstores in Cambridge. In the.“no competition” version, participants were given no.information about the competitive environment..Shoppers were then given a $5 coupon, coded with.the in-store ad version they read. Analyzing.shoppers’ sales receipts and the number of redeemed.coupons, we found that shoppers were significantly.more likely to make a purchase after reading the.“large competitors” version of the in-store ad,.compared to the “small competitors” version or the.“no competition” version. They also purchased more.items and spent more money at the store, compared.to shoppers reading the “small competitors” or “no.competition” versions. These results suggest that.framing the competitive game and emphasizing a.competitive narrative against a larger company can.help a small establishment—and spur consumers to.make a purchase that supports the smaller.competitor..In subsequent studies, we tested this “framing-.the-game” effect in various contexts and product.categories and further found that support for a large.brand decreases when consumers view it as being in.competition with a smaller brand. In one study, we.asked participants to assess two hypothetical rival tire.shops, “Tire World” and “Tire Planet,” under three.conditions—small vs. large, small vs. small or large.vs. large competitors. While participants indicated no.preference for the small or large shop when it was.competing against a competitor of similar size, the.small vs. large competitive context elicited a strong.preference for the small rather than large shop.
Question: The studies in the passage suggest that if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result is that the large store would
Choices:
  A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.
  B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.
  C: benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.
  D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes studies that explored the effects of having a large, dominant competitor on smaller brands. The studies found that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands, instead of harming them. The passage also describes a field study at an independent bookstore in which shoppers were given information about the store's competitors and then given a coupon to use in the store.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Based on the studies described in the passage, it is likely that if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops. This is supported by the finding that support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses research that shows that smaller brands can benefit from highlighting the competitive threat they face from larger organizations. Such highlighting can lead to higher purchase intention, more purchases, and more favorable online reviews. In one field study, shoppers who were exposed to an in-store ad that emphasized the large competitors of a small bookstore were significantly more likely to make a purchase, buy more items, and spend more money than those who were exposed to ads emphasizing small competitors or no competition. The researchers found that support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage describes six lab and field studies that show that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands instead of harming them. When small brands face a competitive threat from large brands, consumer support for the small brand goes up. This support translates into higher purchase intention, more purchases, and more favorable online reviews for the small brand. A field study at an independent bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found that shoppers were significantly more likely to make a purchase and spent more money at the store if they were given an in-store ad emphasizing the store's large competitors, compared to emphasizing small competitors or no competition. 

Action: Answer("D")

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together, to a house divided against itself, and says that it is  contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.When did he learn, and by what authority does he proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that "a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand." Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a "house divided against itself." They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
Question: 80 with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now. Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there has been agitation and resistance.... Do you think that the nature of man will be changed, that the same 85 causes that produced agitation at one time will not have the same effect at another? In the first paragraph of Passage 1, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States is to
Choices:
  A: provide context for Douglas's defense of continued expansion.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. "They jumped up like popcorn," he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. "He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. "I asked 35 him how it went," Ken recalled, "and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' " Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the "aha" moment. "The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively," he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. "It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car," he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)
Question: Which statement best captures Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research?
Choices:
  A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
  B: The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior.
  C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest.
  D: Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel.
Response 0:
Knowledge: Ken Dial designed a project to study how baby game birds learn to fly. He settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species. The local rancher advised him to give the birds something to climb on. When Dial gave them hay bales to perch on, the baby Chukars used their wings and legs cooperatively to climb up the hay bales. This observation led to the discovery of WAIR (wing-assisted inclined running). It allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces and gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying. In an evolutionary context, WAIR offers explanatory powers and a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial's research on ground birds focused on the acquisition of flight.
  He observed young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds "popcorning" behind their parents by taking short hops into the air.
  Ken Dial used Chukar Partridge as a model species for his research.
  Dial's research brought new data to the debate about the origin of birds' flapping flight stroke and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings.
  During the research, a local rancher advised Dial to give the birds something to climb on, leading to Dial's discovery of the wing-assisted incline running technique (WAIR).
  WAIR is a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds.
  WAIR gives young birds an ability to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life and also gives adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The central assumption Ken Dial made in setting up his research was that the acquisition of flight in young birds could shed light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. This is supported by the fact that Dial's research brought new data to the debate about the origin of birds' flapping flight stroke and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings, which takes on surprising explanatory powers in an evolutionary context.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial's research involved studying the Chukar Partridge as a model species for how baby game birds learn to fly.
  Ken Dial discovered that young Chukar Partridges use their wings and legs cooperatively to run up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles, which he called wing-assisted incline running (WAIR).
  Ken Dial used WAIR to explain the origins of the flapping flight stroke of birds and to provide an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial designed a project to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.
  The rancher advised Dial to give the birds something to climb on because ground birds don't like to be on the ground, but rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they are safe from predators.
  Ken Dial observed that baby Chukars were using both their wings and legs to run up the side of a hay bale.
  Ken Dial coined the term WAIR, which stands for wing-assisted incline running.
  WAIR allows young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life and gives adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying.
  The Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial designed a project to study how baby game birds learned to fly using the Chukar Partridge as a model species.
  While describing his laboratory setup to a local rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds, he was advised to give them something to climb on because ground birds prefer to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they are safe from predators. 
  The birds, including the baby Chukars, were observed to use their wings and legs cooperatively, which Ken Dial called the technique WAIR.
  WAIR stands for wing-assisted incline running and it allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying.
  WAIR can explain the origin of the flapping flight stroke of birds and it also has an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings.

Action: Answer("A")  
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial designed a project to study how baby game birds learn to fly by observing Chukar Partridge as a model species. At first, the birds were not using their wings to climb the textured ramp for feed. Terry Dial, Ken's son, noticed that the birds were running and using their wings cooperatively. This led to Ken Dial developing the theory of wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) and documenting the phenomenon in a wide range of species. This gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying. WAIR functioned as a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings. 
Option A: This statement is relevant to Ken Dial's findings, but it is not the central assumption he made while setting up his research.
Option B: This statement does not capture Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research.
Option C: This statement is incorrect because Ken Dial noticed how the birds preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches in the wild where they were safe from predators. 
Option D: This statement is not related to Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial studied the development of young game birds' ability to fly in a controlled research setting.
  The rancher in Montana who supplied Ken with birds advised him to provide perches for the birds since ground birds in the wild prefer to rest on ledges or other elevated perches for safety from predators.
  Dial discovered that young Chukar Partridges use their wings cooperatively with their legs to climb vertical surfaces.
  The climbing technique, which Ken Dial called wing-assisted incline running (WAIR), allows young birds to effectively climb vertical surfaces in their first few weeks of life.
  The technique also provides adult birds with an energy-efficient alternative to flying when ascending steep ramps.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The central assumption that Ken Dial had in setting up his research is that studying the development of young birds' ability to fly sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. This is because Ken Dial's discovery of wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) provided a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds, which is a feature that is not observed in gliding animals and is a shortcoming of the tree-down theory. Additionally, the discovery of an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings, which is a drawback of the ground-up hypothesis, is another example of how the study of young birds' ability to fly can provide insights into the evolution of flight.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial designed a project to investigate how baby game birds learn to fly by observing the behavior of Chukar Partridges.
  The behavior of baby Chukar Partridges running up the side of a hay bale led to the discovery of WAIR, a wing-assisted incline running technique.
  The discovery of WAIR provided an alternative theory to explain the origin of the flapping flight stroke of birds and the function of half-formed wings. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
Ken Dial designed an experiment to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.

It is a mighty people that $\mathrm{He}$ has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile ... working-folk10 of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes-the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a15 history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands ... a history of soldiers, who carried the flag20 across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century ... a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous 25 reasoning we find ourselves to-day....Think of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic's laws cover those islands with justice and safety!

Think of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who will build a . . civilization of energy and industry in Cuba, when a government of law35 replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!think of the prosperous millions that Empress of Islands will support when, obedient to the law of political gravitation, her people ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the40 Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great Republic!\section{Passage 2}If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the45 Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.The Filipinos do not need any encouragement 50 from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, "Give me liberty or give me death," he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or 75 spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so80 low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also85 calculate its effects upon our own nation.

  Passage 2 is written by Bryan in opposition to this view and argues that it is incompatible with American values of self-government and liberty. 
  The passage specifically critiques the potential effects of this imperialist policy on the subject peoples being governed as well as on American domestic politics and values.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 lauds American imperialism and suggests that it is America's destiny to bring freedom and democracy to other countries.
  Passage 2 criticizes America's colonial policies and suggests that America should not deny self-government to other countries, including the Philippines.
  A: Neither passage discusses whether or not most Americans would be unwilling to relocate to distant islands.
  B: While Passage 1 suggests that America could benefit economically from governing other countries, Passage 2 does not criticize America's colonial policies on the grounds that economic domination is the true goal of government. Thus, this is not the correct answer.
  C: Passage 2 does not suggest that the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources, so it is not the correct answer.
  D: Passage 2 criticizes the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for denying self-government to other countries, including the Philippines. Thus, this is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 talks about the greatness of the American land and its people, who are imperial by virtue of their power and authority, and would spread the republic's laws to other lands, such as Hawaii, Porto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines.
  Passage 2 talks about the Republican Party's position on the permanent takeover of the Philippines and the need for the party to defend its position, and criticizes those who advocate for the subjugation of others and the violation of the principle of self-government.
  A: There is no mention of Americans relocating to distant islands in either passage.
  B: There is no mention of economic domination as the true goal in either passage.
  C: There is no mention of the islanders insisting upon an equal distribution of resources in either passage.
  D: Passage 2 criticizes the idea of American imperialism and the violation of the principle of self-government. This is consistent with the notion that the islanders would object to being governed by Americans, as implied in option D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: Passage 2 presents Bryan's arguments about the principles of American governance, and how imperialism would contradict those principles, especially in the case of the Philippine Islands. Passage 1 discusses the potential benefits and greatness of the United States and its territories, including the Philippines. 
A: Passage 2 does not mention anything about the willingness of Americans to relocate to distant islands, so it cannot be inferred that Bryan criticizes this aspect of Beveridge's vision in Passage 1.
B: While Passage 2 suggests that Bryan is critical of imperialism, there is no indication that he attributes ulterior motives of economic domination to the American government in its governance of island territories, so this choice cannot be inferred either.
C: Passage 2 does not discuss any equal distribution of resources among islanders, so this choice cannot be inferred from the passage.
D: Passage 2 presents Bryan's argument that America should not govern the Philippine Islands or any other territory in a way that contradicts the principles of self-government and liberty. Therefore, it can most reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being naive, since it fails to take into account the islanders' objection to being governed by Americans. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 talks about the greatness of the American land and people and mentions the idea of spreading American institutions and government to territories like Hawaii, Porto Rico, the Philippines, and Cuba.
  Passage 2 presents a critical view towards the idea of America holding the Philippine Islands permanently and governing it as a European empire. The passage argues that such a policy would lead to resistance from the subject races and that the Republican party should state its position on the matter.

Analysis:
  Bryan in Passage 2 is critical of the idea of American imperialism and argues that the American government should not govern the Philippine Islands or any other territories as a European empire. The passage argues that such a policy would lead to resistance and hatred towards America and that it is against the American principle of self-government. Therefore, it can be inferred that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes the acquisition of various territories by the United States and presents a vision of American governance of these territories. 
  Passage 2 responds to this vision, particularly with regards to the Philippines, and argues that the principles of self-government should be upheld both within the US and in its dealings with other nations and territories. 
  There is no indication that Bryan criticizes the vision presented in Passage 1 for being any of the reasons listed in the answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses the idea of American imperialism and argues that the United States should not hold the Philippines as a colony but should instead uphold the principles of self-government. 
  Passage 1 seems to celebrate American imperialism and expansion, referring to the Philippines as the "Empress of Islands" and describing how Americans will build a "civilization of energy and industry" in Cuba.

Inference:
  Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being naive, since he argues against the idea of American imperialism in Passage 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes the American destiny of promoting liberty overseas, including governing territories like Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippines.
  Passage 2 criticizes the idea of American imperialism and governing of subject races overseas.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a vision of American expansionism, in which the United States acquires territories abroad and governs them based on the principles of liberty and democracy.
  Passage 2 expresses concern about the negative consequences of such expansionism and argues that it contradicts the principles of self-government and liberty enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.
  Bryan criticizes the idea that the United States should govern the Philippines in the same way that European countries govern their colonies.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 discuss different viewpoints on American governance of island territories.
  Passage 1 suggests that America has a divine destiny to bring liberty to territories such as Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippines. 
  Passage 2 argues that American governance of such territories would go against the principles of the Declaration of Independence and self-government, and that the Filipinos would resist such governance.

Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.The brains of humans are conspicuously larger than the.brains of other apes, but the human-specific genetic.factors responsible for the uniquely large human.neocortex remain obscure. Since humans split from.chimps, which have brains roughly a third of human size,.the human genome has undergone roughly 15 million.changes. Which of these genetic tweaks could have led to.big brains?.About six years ago, scientists in David Haussler’s lab at.Howard Hughes Medical Institute discovered a gene called.NOTCH2NL. It’s a relative of NOTCH2, a gene that.scientists knew was central to early brain development..NOTCH2 controls vital decisions regarding when and how.many neurons to make..When the Haussler team looked in the official version.of the human genome at that time^1 —version 37—.NOTCH2NL appeared to be located in chromosome 1.near a region linked to abnormal brain size. Delete a hunk.of the region, and brains tend to shrink. Duplicate part of.it, and brains tend to overgrow..“We thought, ‘Oh, this is incredible,’” Haussler said..NOTCH2NL seemed to check all the boxes for a key role.in human brain development. But when the team mapped.NOTCH2NL’s precise location in the genome, they.discovered the gene wasn’t actually in the relevant.chromosomal region after all; the once-promising.candidate seemed to be a dud..“We were downhearted,” Haussler recalled. That all.changed with the next official version of the human.genome—version 38. In this iteration, NOTCH2NL was.located in the crucial region. “And there were three.versions of it,” Haussler exclaimed. Over the last three.million years, his team calculated, NOTCH2NL was.repeatedly copy-pasted into the genome, what he calls “a.series of genetic accidents.”.Genetic analysis of several primate species revealed that.the three genes exist only in humans and their recent.relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, not in.chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. What’s more, the.timing of these genes’ emergence matches up with the.period in the fossil record when our ancestors’ craniums.began to enlarge, Haussler points out. Together, the results.suggest that NOTCH2NL genes played a role in beefing.up human brain size..Passage 2.Modern humans have brains that are more than three.times larger than our closest living relatives,.chimpanzees and bonobos. Scientists don’t agree on.when and how this dramatic increase took place, but.new analysis of 94 hominin fossils shows that average.brain size increased gradually and consistently over the.past three million years..The research, published in The Proceedings of the.Royal Society B, shows that the trend was caused.primarily by evolution of larger brains within.populations of individual species, but the introduction of.new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones also played a part..“Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that.makes us human. It’s related to cultural complexity,.language, tool making and all these other things that.make us unique,” said Andrew Du, PhD, a postdoctoral.scholar at the University of Chicago and first author of.the study. “The earliest hominins had brain sizes like.chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since.then. So, it’s important to understand how we got here.”.Du and his colleagues compared published research.data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13.different species, beginning with the earliest.unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including.Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size.began to overlap with that of modern-day humans..The researchers saw that when the species were.counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a.common ancestor, the average brain size increased.gradually over three million years. Looking more closely,.the increase was driven by three different factors,.primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within.individual species populations, but also by the addition.of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones..The study quantifies for the first time when and by.how much each of these factors contributes to the clade-.level pattern. Du said he likens it to how a football coach.might build a roster of bigger, strong players. One way.would be to make all the players hit the weight room to.bulk up. But the coach could also recruit new, larger.players and cut the smallest ones..(^1) The reference version of the human genome goes through updates to.more completely map out each chromosomal sequence.

Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise.

In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals.

Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses a new report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which suggests that the number of wild tigers may have been slowly rising.
  The report compiled surveys taken across Asia and found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today, a considerable increase from 3,200 recorded in 2010.
  The commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population.
  However, while several countries have seen tiger populations go up, others have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 discusses the flaws in the methodologies used by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum regarding tiger population estimates.
  The authors argue that the overall number of wild tigers may not matter as much as monitoring the source populations and using reliable counts to set realistic goals for future growth.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a new report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that suggests that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years, but that counting wild tigers is difficult, and that while several countries including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 criticizes the methodology used by some organizations, including the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum, to estimate tiger numbers, and argues that countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that suggests that tiger populations in some countries have grown due to successful conservation programs. However, counting wild tigers is difficult and their populations are notoriously elusive, making them difficult to keep track of. Numbers may reflect better surveying methods. While the global number of wild tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country analysis is more sobering, with some countries having seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 argues that although the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not, whether because of a lack of understanding of or comfort with the new methods or because the old methods cast a more flattering light on their efforts. The passage criticizes the use of flawed methodologies and weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor in estimating tiger numbers. It suggests that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from monitoring and growing the source populations using the best science available.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 reports that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years. It indicates that this could be due to the success of conservation programs in some countries, but it also notes that countries including Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years. The passage warns that it can be difficult to keep track of wild tigers and to know whether the populations are truly on the rise.
  Passage 2 criticizes the methods and goals of some conservation agencies and warns that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions can distract from monitoring the source populations, which is the top priority.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passages discuss recent studies on wild tiger populations, specifically mentioning that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years. The study suggests that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. However, the authors also mention that counting wild tigers is not easy and that the increased numbers may in part reflect better surveying methods. 
Action: Answer("A") 
Based on the information provided in the passages, it can be reasonably inferred that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries (such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia) than in others (such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and China). Therefore, the correct answer is A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  According to Passage 1, the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years. In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia, researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. While the global number of wild tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country analysis is more sobering. Though several countries including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia may have gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss. Passage 2 suggests that although the science of tiger population assessment has been rapidly progressed, its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not been uniform. Adoption has been hindered by a lack of understanding of or comfort with the new methods or because the old methods cast a more flattering light on their efforts. Flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor, have been used to estimate tiger populations. Several Southeast Asian countries and Russia have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 states that according to a new report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years. The study suggests that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. However, some countries have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss. 
  Passage 2 points out the limitations of some old methodologies used to estimate tiger populations in certain countries, and that such speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be our top priority: guarding and growing the source populations. Furthermore, it argues that as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction of wild species, we cannot afford to divorce conservation practices from sound science if we are to have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the tiger. 
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 indicates that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years, but it also indicates that populations are not rising uniformly across all countries. The passage also acknowledges that counting wild tigers is difficult, and factors such as poaching and habitat loss can negatively impact populations. 
  Passage 2 also references the difficulty in accurately estimating tiger populations and notes that reliance on outdated tools may lead to flawed methodologies. 

Action: Answer("A") 
Based on the passages, it can be reasonably inferred that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries (such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia) than in others, and that data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia is not convincing.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 reports that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years, but also notes that counting wild tigers is not easy and that a country-by-country analysis shows that some countries have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 criticizes the use of outdated tools to estimate tiger numbers, and argues that the focus should be on monitoring source populations using the best available science to set realistic goals, develop suitable strategies, and measure the impact of conservation efforts.

Action: Answer("A") 

The authors of both passages suggest that the recovery of wild tiger populations is not uniform across countries. While some countries, such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia may have seen an increase in tiger populations due to aggressive conservation efforts, others have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss. Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others (choice A).

Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar. In 1789,.the French formed a new governmental body known as the.National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of.political and social change known as the French Revolution..To make a government requires no great.prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience,.and the work is done. To give freedom is still more.easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to.let go the rein. But to form a free government, that is,.to temper together these opposite elements of liberty.and restraint in one consistent work, requires much.thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and.combining mind. This I do not find in those who.take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they.are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather.believe it. It would put them below the common level.of human understanding. But when the leaders.choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of.popularity, their talents, in the construction of the.state, will be of no service. They will become.flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not.the guides, of the people. If any of them should.happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly.limited and defined with proper qualifications, he.will be immediately outbid by his competitors who.will produce something more splendidly popular..Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause..Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of.cowards, and compromise as the prudence of.traitors, until, in hopes of preserving the credit which.may enable him to temper and moderate, on some.occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become.active in propagating doctrines and establishing.powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose.at which he ultimately might have aimed..But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all.that deserves commendation in the indefatigable.labors of this Assembly? I do not deny that, among.an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some.good may have been done. They who destroy.everything certainly will remove some grievance..They who make everything new have a chance that.they may establish something beneficial. To give.them credit for what they have done in virtue of the.authority they have usurped, or which can excuse.them in the crimes by which that authority has been.acquired, it must appear that the same things could.not have been accomplished without producing such.a revolution. Most assuredly they might....Some.usages have been abolished on just grounds, but.they were such that if they had stood as they were to.all eternity, they would little detract from the.happiness and prosperity of any state. The.improvements of the National Assembly are.superficial, their errors fundamental..Whatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather.to recommend to our neighbors the example of the.British constitution than to take models from them.for the improvement of our own. In the former, they.have got an invaluable treasure. They are not, I think,.without some causes of apprehension and complaint,.but these they do not owe to their constitution but to.their own conduct. I think our happy situation owing.to our constitution, but owing to the whole of it, and.not to any part singly, owing in a great measure to.what we have left standing in our several reviews and.reformations as well as to what we have altered or.superadded. Our people will find employment.enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent.spirit in guarding what they possess from violation. I.would not exclude alteration neither, but even when.I changed, it should be to preserve. I should be led to.my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I.should follow the example of our ancestors. I would.make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style.of the building. A politic caution, a guarded.circumspection, a moral rather than a complexional.timidity were among the ruling principles of our.forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being.illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of.France tell us they have got so abundant a share, they.acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and.fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus.fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct.attended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution.if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their.bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let us preserve.what they have left; and, standing on the firm ground.of the British constitution, let us be satisfied to.admire rather than attempt to follow in their.desperate flights the aeronauts of France.
Question: It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly’s decision to

  A: limit the king’s power.
  B: expand the size of the government.
  C: seek the approval of the public.
  D: ignore the advice of former leaders.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Burke is criticizing the National Assembly during the French Revolution and their approach to governance.
  The passage does not explicitly mention the National Assembly's decision to limit the king's power.
  The passage does not explicitly mention the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of the government.
  The passage references the National Assembly's tendency to prioritize popularity over rational decision-making.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar who lived during the French Revolution.
  The National Assembly was a new governmental body formed by the French in 1789 at the beginning of the French Revolution.
  Burke believes that it is easy to create a government, but it is much more difficult to create a free government that balances the elements of liberty and restraint.
  Burke has a negative view of the leaders of the National Assembly, whom he sees as more interested in gaining popularity than in creating a functional government.
  Burke acknowledges that some good things have come out of the National Assembly's work, but he believes that most of their changes are superficial, and their errors are fundamental.
Action: Answer("B")  
Burke does not mention any specific action of the National Assembly to limit the King's power or to ignore the advice of former leaders. Although the National Assembly sought the approval of the public, this is not the primary reason for Burke's criticism. However, Burke does criticize the National Assembly's expansion of the size of the government, which can be inferred from his comment that "To make a government requires no great prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience, and the work is done." and later he says "If any of them should happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly limited and defined with proper qualifications, he will be immediately outbid by his competitors who will produce something more splendidly popular." He believes that the National Assembly's expansion of the government is one of the superficial changes that they have made. Therefore, the correct answer is B: expand the size of the government.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Edmund Burke's thoughts on the French Revolution and the National Assembly.
  The passage suggests that Burke is critical of the National Assembly and believes that they lack the ability to form a free government.
  Burke suggests that the leaders of the National Assembly are more interested in popularity than in creating a government that balances liberty and restraint.
  Burke also suggests that the improvements made by the National Assembly are superficial and their errors fundamental.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to limit the king's power, seek the approval of the public, or ignore the advice of former leaders. However, Burke suggests that the National Assembly is ineffective in tempering together the opposite elements of liberty and restraint in one consistent work, and that their errors are fundamental. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that Burke is upset with the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of the government, which may contribute to their inability to form a free government.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke expresses his opposition to the French Revolution and the National Assembly that formed during that period.
  Burke believes that creating a government and giving freedom are relatively easy tasks compared to forming a free government that balances liberty and restraint.
  Burke criticizes the National Assembly for being too focused on popularity and not having the necessary skills, knowledge, and judgment to create a functional government.
  Burke acknowledges some positive changes made by the National Assembly but believes that they are insignificant compared to the harm caused by their violent and fundamental errors.
  Burke suggests that Britain's constitution is a better model for government than the French Revolution, as it has stood the test of time and inspired other nations.
Action: Answer("B") 
Burke does not specifically mention the National Assembly's decision to limit the king's power or ignore the advice of former leaders, and seeking public approval is a general aspect of democratic governance, not a specific decision. However, Burke does criticize the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of the government, which is implicit in his argument that creating a free government requires balancing liberty and restraint, and that the National Assembly lacks the judgment and skills necessary for this task. Therefore, the best answer is "B: expand the size of the government."
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar who was a vocal critic of the French Revolution and the National Assembly.
  The passage describes Burke's belief that forming a free government, one that balances liberty and restraint, is difficult and requires deep thought, reflection, and a powerful mind.
  Burke is critical of the leaders of the National Assembly and sees them as more interested in popularity and personal gain than in creating a stable and effective government.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  Based on the passage, it can be inferred that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to seek the approval of the public by making themselves "bidders at an auction of popularity." Burke believes that this approach will result in leaders who are flatterers instead of legislators and who promote doctrines and powers that will ultimately defeat any sober purpose they might have aimed for. Therefore, it can be inferred that Burke is most upset with the National Assembly's attempts to seek popularity and public approval.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar who was alive during the period of political and social change known as the French Revolution.
  The National Assembly was a new governmental body formed in France in 1789, at the beginning of the French Revolution.
  Burke believes that forming a free government requires much thought and reflection, and that the leaders of the National Assembly are not up to the task.
  Burke believes that the National Assembly leaders are more interested in popularity than in creating a good government.
Action: Answer("B") 
From the passage, Burke doesn't seem to be particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to limit the king's power, seek the approval of the public or ignore the advice of former leaders. However, Burke does criticize the National Assembly for expanding the size of the government. In the passage, Burke suggests that to form a free government requires "to temper together these opposite elements of liberty and restraint in one consistent work", but he believes that the National Assembly has failed to do so, saying "They will become flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not the guides, of the people." Therefore, the best answer choice is B.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke, a British politician and scholar, reflected on the French Revolution.
  In the passage, Burke highlights that it is easy to create a basic government and give freedom, but it is difficult to create a free government with both liberty and restraint. He criticizes the National Assembly for their actions and lack of thought and reflection. Burke acknowledges that the National Assembly may have done some good but emphasizes that their improvements are superficial and their errors are fundamental. Burke also focuses on the value and success of the British constitution. He does not want France to model their system off of France's revolution, but rather the British constitution.

Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, Burke does not specifically mention a decision to limit the king's power (A), seek the approval of the public (C), or ignore the advice of former leaders (D), but he does explicitly mention his dissatisfaction with the National Assembly's work and lack of thought and reflection. Burke also calls out the "infinite number of acts of violence and folly." In this context, it can be inferred that the "size" of the government in choice (B) is a relevant aspect to Burke's critique of the National Assembly. Therefore, the best answer is B.
Response 7:
Knowledge: Burke is discussing the difficulties associated with forming a free government, and he is critical of the National Assembly in France. He argues that giving freedom and establishing a government are easy in comparison to forming a free government that balances liberty and restraint. He is critical of the National Assembly's leaders for focusing on popularity and producing grand schemes of liberty, rather than soberly limited proposals. He suggests that the National Assembly's approach is fundamentally flawed and that true progress can only be made by preserving what already exists. 
Action: Answer("B") 
Although Burke criticizes many aspects of the National Assembly's approach, there is no specific mention of the Assembly's decision to limit the king's power (A), seek the approval of the public (C), or ignore the advice of former leaders (D). However, Burke does criticize the National Assembly's approach as superficial and fundamentally flawed, suggesting that its expansive vision of change is misguided. Therefore, the best answer choice is (B), which refers to the Assembly's efforts to expand the size of the government.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar who wrote about the French Revolution in his book "Reflections on the Revolution in France."
  In this passage, Burke is expressing his disapproval of the National Assembly in France during the French Revolution.
  The passage mentions the difficulty of forming a free government that balances liberty and restraint in a consistent manner.
  Burke criticizes the leaders of the National Assembly for being more interested in gaining popularity than in creating a free government.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: There is no direct mention of the National Assembly's decision to limit the king's power, seek the approval of the public, or ignore the advice of former leaders in this passage. Burke's criticism is more general, focused on the difficulty of creating a free government and his belief that the leaders of the National Assembly are more interested in gaining popularity than in creating a consistent and effective government. However, Burke does mention that the National Assembly has expanded the size of the government, stating that "they who make everything new have a chance that they may establish something beneficial." Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of the government.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Burke is critical of the National Assembly and the French Revolution.
  Burke believes that creating a free government that balances liberty and restraint is difficult.
  Burke criticizes the National Assembly for being more concerned with popularity than with creating a functional government.
  Burke acknowledges that some good may have come from the actions of the National Assembly, but he believes that their errors are fundamental.
Action: Answer("C") 
Reasoning: From the passage, Burke criticizes the National Assembly for being more concerned with popularity than with creating a functional government. Specifically, he says that the leaders are choosing to make themselves bidders at an auction of popularity, and that they will become flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not the guides, of the people. Therefore, it can be inferred that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to seek the approval of the public.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: “I’ve come to inquire if you have work for me. That is, if.my performance pleased you before.” A deliberate prompt. I.didn’t want to be hired because of my need or his kindness. I.wanted my talent to be the reason he wanted me back..“Indeed” was all he offered..What now to fill the suspended moment? His new.projects. I asked. His eyebrows leapt up in symmetrical.curves..“A Byzantine chapel for the World’s Columbian.Exposition in Chicago next year. Four times bigger than the.Paris Exposition Universelle. It will be the greatest assembly.of artists since the fifteenth century.” He counted on his.fingers and then drummed them on the desk. “Only fifteen.months away. In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it
Choices:
  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
  A single trigger hair being touched does not reach the level of calcium concentration required. 
  The trap remembers the first touch in order to react upon the second by storing information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  If the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:  
  Venus flytrap needs to make sure its prey is large enough before closing its trap because this requires a significant amount of energy.
  The Venus flytrap uses the trigger hairs on its leaves to "feel" the prey and as a signal to spring the trap closed.
  The flytrap stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  If the prey touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut, but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  1. The Venus flytrap requires multiple triggers before it can close its trap.
  2. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours. So, the plant only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
  3. Touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap, and a relatively high concentration of calcium is required to close the trap. 
  4. If a second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The Venus flytrap requires two hair triggers within 20 seconds to close the trap, conserving its energy and calcium reserves. The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close, and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap closes its trap only when it's sure that the prey is worth its time, so it needs to be triggered by at least two hairs within about twenty seconds. 
  The closure requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours. 
  Touching a trigger hair causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap. Thus, maintaining a high enough level of calcium is required to spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold. If the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers to spring its trap shut, conserving its energy by only closing when there is prey large enough to be worth its time.
  The electrical charge of the trap increases rapidly when a trigger hair is touched, leading to the opening of calcium channels. Calcium ions are required for the trap to close.
  If the second trigger does not happen quickly enough, the calcium ion concentrations will dissipate and the trap will not close.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap needs to conserve energy.
  Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect is worth its time. 
  The Venus flytrap springs its trap when the proper prey makes its way across the trap.
  The Venus flytrap has triggers that must be touched by prey in order to close the trap.
  When an insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut, but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.

Action: Answer("C") 
Based on the passage, a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it safeguards the plant's energy supply. By requiring multiple triggers, the plant conserves energy by ensuring that it only expends energy on capturing prey that is worth its time.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the visiting insect is large enough to be worth its time.
  The electric charge of its leaf causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
  A second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.
  If the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap needs two trigger hairs to be touched by its prey in order to spring shut and capture the insect. The encoding of the information of the prey encounter in the first hair is through an electric charge induced calcium channel opening in the trap. The calcium ions concentration dissipates over time, so a second trigger needs to happen quickly to push the concentration over the threshold and spring the trap. 
A: The passage does not provide any information about the Venus flytrap's ability to identify the species of its prey.
B: According to the model proposed by Hodick and Sievers, the Venus flytrap needs to maintain a high enough level of calcium in order to close, so it is not conserving calcium reserves.
C: The passage does not provide any information about the Venus flytrap's energy supply and how the requirement of multiple triggers safeguards it.
D: Answer("D") The Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers ensures that the trap does not close prematurely, before capturing its prey. It saves the plant's energy by only closing when it is sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.

Topic: English
Context: At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. "They jumped up like popcorn," he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. "He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. "I asked 35 him how it went," Ken recalled, "and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' " Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the "aha" moment. "The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively," he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. "It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car," he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis," says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. "Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth," Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. "We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment," Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 "standard of care treatment." That's going to take five years and $\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.

Choices:
  A: emphasize the scale of the effort needed to make teixobactin available for consumer use.
  B: criticize the level of funding that the government has committed to teixobactin development.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

I.wanted my talent to be the reason he wanted me back..“Indeed” was all he offered..What now to fill the suspended moment? His new.projects. I asked. His eyebrows leapt up in symmetrical.curves..“A Byzantine chapel for the World’s Columbian.Exposition in Chicago next year. Four times bigger than the.Paris Exposition Universelle. It will be the greatest assembly.of artists since the fifteenth century.” He counted on his.fingers and then drummed them on the desk. “Only fifteen.months away. In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin?

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: We are told that it is not within the "province of woman," to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a "political question," and we are "stepping out of our  sphere," when we take part in its discussion. It is nottrue that it is merely a political question, it is likewise a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of religion; a question which, while it involves considerations of immense importance to the welfare and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into thehome-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to unrequited toil-whether he shall walk erect in the dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckonedamong the beasts which perish - whether his bones and sinews shall be his own, or another's-whether his child shall receive the protection of its natural guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest ofthe master may dictate $\_\ldots$ these considerations are all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.And is a subject comprehending interests of such magnitude, merely a "political question," and one in which woman "can take no part without losingsomething of the modesty and gentleness which are her most appropriate ornaments"? May not the "ornament of a meek and quiet spirit" exist with an upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart isopen to the claims of humanity, or less modest because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their rescue?By the Constitution of the United States, the  whole physical power of the North is pledged for the suppression of domestic insurrections, and should the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the North are bound to make common cause with the 40 tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet, every effort on the part of the slave, for the attainment of his freedom. And when the father, husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes to mingle in the unholy warfare, "to become the 45 executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands,"1 will the mother, wife, daughter, and sister feel that they have no interest in this subject? Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and50 their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she55 will not be deterred from the performance of her duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the cry of political question.But admitting it to be a political question, have we no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not60 permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of our own family circle, and of the present hour? May we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the 65 earth? Must we witness "the headlong rage or heedless folly," with which our nation is rushing onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its downward course? Shall we silently behold the land which we love with all the heart-warm affection of70 children, rendered a hissing and a reproach throughout the world, by this system which is already tolling the death-bell of her decease among the nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright75 prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely our hearts cling to "our altars and our homes," the80 more fervent are our aspirations that every inhabitant of our land may be protected in his fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom85 God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our course, then, still be onward!

  C: Smith introduces her subject and provides historical background for understanding it.
  D: Smith identifies a problem and proposes steps to remedy it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")  

Explanation: 
The first paragraph of the passage introduces a conventional view that women do not have a place in discussions of slavery, but rejects this view by arguing that slavery is not just a political question, but also a question of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. Therefore, the best choice that summarizes the first paragraph is B ("Smith rejects a claim and elaborates on her reasons for doing so").
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The first paragraph of the passage rejects a claim that it is not within the "province of woman" to discuss slavery and provides reasons why this is not true. It explains that the issue of slavery is not merely a political question, but also involves considerations of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. It argues that this is a subject comprehending interests of such magnitude that it cannot be merely a "political question," and one in which woman "can take no part without losing something of the modesty and gentleness which are her most appropriate ornaments".
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
In the first paragraph, Smith rejects a claim that women should not discuss the subject of slavery and elaborates on her reasons for doing so. She argues that the subject of slavery is not merely a political question, but also a question of justice, humanity, morality, and religion that involves considerations of immense importance to the welfare and prosperity of the country and millions of enslaved people. She refutes the notion that it is outside of women's "sphere" to discuss such matters and suggests that women can be both gentle and meek while having an upright mind and an enlightened intellect. Therefore, choice B, which accurately summarizes Smith's rejection of a claim and her elaboration on it, is the best option.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The first paragraph introduces the issue of discussing slavery as a woman. It refutes the notion that discussing slavery is "outside of the province of women" by pointing out that it is not just a political issue but also a moral and humane issue. It argues that women have a stake in the issue, even if it is considered a political matter. The paragraph does not explicitly provide historical background or offer a solution to the problem.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Answer: B
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The first paragraph is a response to the notion that women should not participate in political discussions, especially those related to slavery. Smith rejects this notion and elaborates on her reasons for doing so.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: The first paragraph begins by describing a conventional or dominant viewpoint that restricts women from discussing slavery. Smith then rejects or challenges this viewpoint by arguing that slavery is not simply a political question and that women have just as much a right to participate in its discussion as men do. Therefore, Option B is the best choice as it accurately summarizes the main argument of the paragraph.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B") 

The correct answer is B. In the first paragraph, Smith challenges the idea that it is not within a woman's province to discuss the subject of slavery. She argues that the subject is not merely a political question, but one of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. She questions whether women must sacrifice their modesty and gentleness to discuss the matter and whether they should remain silent while their enslaved sisters suffer.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")

The first paragraph of the passage rejects the conventional viewpoint that women should not be involved in discussing the subject of slavery. Smith elaborates on her reasons for believing that it is not merely a political question, but a question of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. She argues that while it involves considerations of immense importance to the welfare and prosperity of the country, it also enters deeply into the home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of fellow beings.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
In the first paragraph, Smith rejects a conventional viewpoint that women should not discuss the subject of slavery and explains her reasons for doing so. She argues that the subject of liberty or slavery is not merely a political question, but also a question of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. She questions whether women must necessarily be less gentle because they feel for the degradation of their enslaved sisters or less modest because they would stretch forth their hand for their rescue. Thus, choice B, "Smith rejects a claim and elaborates on her reasons for doing so," best summarizes the first paragraph.

  B: This is not the right answer. While Smith does argue that this is not simply a political question, she makes it clear that women should not be politically neutral. 
  C: This is not mentioned in the passage. 
  D: This is the correct answer. The passage argues that the women should oppose slavery and the extension of unfair laws to other groups of people, including slaves. Additionally, Smith argues that women should continue to move forward on this issue and not remain neutral. 
Action: Answer("D")

In the passage, Smith argues that women can engage in acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity. The passage argues that women have a moral obligation to support the abolition of slavery and to take part in political discussions despite social expectations suggesting they should not be involved in "political questions." The passage further argues that women can be gentle and act according to principles of modesty while simultaneously engaging in political discussions to support humanitarian endeavors, such as ending slavery.

Response 5:
Knowledge: Smith argues that women can take an active part in discussing the question of slavery, and that it is not a political question, but also one of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. While it involves considerations of immense importance to the welfare and prosperity of the country, it enters deeply into the home-concerns, the everyday feelings of millions of fellow beings. At one point, she asks whether the "ornament of a meek and quiet spirit" must necessarily be less gentle or less modest because it is open to the claims of humanity. Smith also suggests that women cannot remain neutral in light of the fact that the Constitution pledges the whole physical power of the North for the suppression of domestic insurrections, meaning the men of the North would be compelled to put down, at the point of the bayonet, every effort on the part of the slave for the attainment of his freedom. In such a scenario, would the mother, wife, daughter, and sister feel that they have no interest in this subject? Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:

  The passage argues that women can engage in the discussion of slavery as it is not merely a political question but also a matter of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. Furthermore, women should not be deterred from their duty by the cry of political question.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage argues that women should be allowed to discuss and act against slavery, and suggests that this is both a moral and political issue. It also argues that this is an issue that concerns women personally, rather than solely being a matter for men. The passage does not mention anything about women contributing to their family's financial security, nor does it say anything about resisting war. 

Action: Answer("A")

The passage argues that women are capable of engaging in humanitarian issues without sacrificing their femininity.

A: This answer is correct based on the passage. Smith argues that women can take part in discussions related to the issue of slavery without compromising their femininity.

B: This answer is not correct. The passage argues that slavery is not merely a political but also a moral issue. Therefore, it is not possible to be morally neutral while discussing the issue.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions.

Choices:
  A: Vesta is not the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt.
  B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
  C: iron fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  D: there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" - the rarity of mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  It suggests that iron fragments may survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart due to differences in location within an asteroid and material strength.
  It proposes that the parent bodies of iron meteorites may have formed closer to the sun, and that collisions in that region made it more difficult for rocky fragments to survive.
  Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are discussed as being particularly weak compared to mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which suggests that there are few mantle rocks in the asteroid belt and in our meteorite collection. This problem is a long-standing puzzle, and it is believed that iron fragments are more likely to survive in the asteroid belt than rocky fragments due to their placement in an asteroid's core.
  A: The passage does not suggest that there should be other large differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt. 
  B: The passage does not suggest that the asteroid belt should have fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does. 
  C: The passage suggests the opposite; rocky fragments are more likely to be removed when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is more likely to survive. Thus, rocky fragments are expected to be smaller than iron fragments. 
  D: The passage does not suggest that there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how collisional erosion within the asteroid belt cannot be the whole story to explain the rarity of mantle rocks in the meteorite collection and the asteroid belt. 
  The passage suggests that almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions, and this explains the rarity of the mantle rocks. 
  One possible explanation is that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets. 
  
Action: Answer("B") 
The passage suggests that, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then, as a result, scientists would expect to find that the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" which suggests that rocky material from the mantle of iron parent asteroids is missing from the asteroid belt.
  Scientists suggest that if most differentiated bodies broke apart early in the solar system, then all the mantle material has been ground down into dust and lost over the billions of years. 
  Primitive asteroids, which are no stronger than mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids, have survived in the asteroid belt, indicating that collisional erosion cannot be the whole story.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two types of asteroids: differentiated (iron) and primitive (rocky).
  Collisional erosion is the process by which asteroid collisions cause fragmentation, which can lead to the creation of smaller asteroids.
  Iron is stronger than rock, which gives iron fragments a better chance of surviving in space.
  
Analysis:
  The passage discusses how the rarity of mantle rocks in the asteroid belt leads to the "missing mantle problem". One possible explanation discussed is the idea of "collisional erosion", or the destruction of asteroid bodies through collisions. The passage suggests that if collisional erosion was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, scientists would expect to find that the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does. This would mean that almost all of the differentiated bodies that existed were destroyed in violent collisions, and only primitive meteorites survived.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" and suggests that the rocky mantle material from differentiated asteroids may have been eroded away over time through collisional erosion. However, the fact that primitive asteroids, which are no stronger than mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids, have survived suggests that collisional erosion cannot be the whole story. 
A: The passage does not discuss the number of large differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt, so it does not support this option.
B: The passage does not mention a relationship between collisional erosion and the number of primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt. It suggests that primitive asteroids were able to survive despite having a similar composition to the mantle rocks of differentiated asteroids, but it does not imply that there were fewer primitive asteroids in the past.
C: The passage discusses how iron fragments are more likely to survive than rocky fragments due to their strength, but it does not make any comparison regarding the size of these fragments relative to each other.
D: The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" and mentions that almost all differentiated bodies may have been destroyed, leaving very few intact differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt today. It does not provide enough information to support or refute the idea that there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses that the "missing mantle problem" is a puzzle because the rocky material from the mantles of asteroids has been missing from our meteorite collections. The passage suggests that iron fragments have survived better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart, and thus rocky fragments are removed first. The rarity of mantle rocks is a consequence of the fact that differentiated asteroids break apart more easily than primitive asteroids, and that the rocky fragments from differentiated asteroids are removed first before the iron fragments. 
A: The passage does not directly address whether Vesta is the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt, so this choice is unlikely.
B: The passage does not suggest that the asteroid belt has fewer primitive asteroids than it currently has if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage. Thus, this choice is unlikely.
C: The passage suggests the opposite; that rocky fragments tend to be smaller than iron fragments. Thus, this choice is unlikely.
D: The passage suggests that primitive asteroids have a greater likelihood of survival when compared to differentiated asteroids. Therefore, scientists would not expect there to be as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt if almost all differentiated asteroids have been destroyed through violent collisions. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how the rarity of mantle rocks found in the asteroid belt, known as the "missing mantle problem," is a long-standing puzzle. The passage suggests that if almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions, then scientists would expect to find that almost none of the differentiated asteroids survived. 
A: The passage suggests that Vesta might be one of the few remaining differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt, but it doesn't suggest whether or not there might be other large differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt. Therefore, A is not a correct choice.
B: The passage doesn't suggest that there are fewer primitive asteroids than there currently are. Therefore, B is not a correct choice.
C: The passage doesn't suggest the relative sizes of iron fragments to rocky fragments in the asteroid belt. Therefore, C is not a correct choice.
D: The passage indicates that primitive asteroids are no stronger than mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. Therefore, if almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions, then scientists would expect to find the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed, then most, if not all, differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions. 
  A: The passage does not provide information on whether Vesta is the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt.
  B: The passage suggests that primitive asteroids have survived better than differentiated ones, and that the asteroid belt contains a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron. Therefore, this choice is inconsistent with the information in the passage.
  C: The passage does not provide support for this choice.
  D: The passage implies that there were originally more differentiated asteroids than primitive ones in the asteroid belt because the passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which suggests that mantle rocks are rare in the asteroid belt and a long-standing puzzle. The reason for the rarity of mantle rocks is explained by the fact that rocky fragments from differentiated asteroids have to survive in space for longer than iron fragments. This implies that there were more iron fragments than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt over time, which could only be the case if there were more differentiated asteroids than primitive ones. This choice matches the information in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage roughly explores the rarity of mantle rocks in meteorites and asteroids. 
  Collisional erosion cannot be the only factor in the disappearance of the mantle rocks. 
  The passage suggests that differentiated iron parent bodies formed closer to the Sun may have dispersed more within the asteroid belt. The primitive parent bodies formed later and hence more likely to have survived. 
  A: The passage does not provide evidence to suggest this.
  B: The passage suggests that the primitive asteroids were later to form and therefore more of them survived. Hence, this is a logical inference, but it may not be the only explanation for the presence of rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  C: The passage suggests that iron fragments are more likely to survive due to the metal's inherent strength. Therefore, this is incorrect.
  D: This is a possibility suggested in the passage. However, the passage emphasizes the rarity of differentiated asteroid parent bodies, so this answer choice seems less likely than option B.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Many millennia before the invention of herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a  valuable part of an integrated weed-management 5 program. Although plowing kills standing weeds, farmers have long known that it often leads to the emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.Ecologists have shown that a farmer's field can have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter 10 buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists have shown that seeds buried more than about one centimeter below the soil surface do not receive enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow, which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil15 surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by exposure to sunlight?Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a 20 relatively simple experiment, they went to ten different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then25 exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples, weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a "light break," and this stimulates their 30 germination.More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany reasoned that when farmers plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is35 turned over, and that this stimulates their germination. Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if40 farmers simply plowed their fields during the night, when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which photons hit the surface] is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. Although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike 45 each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when he first came up with this idea because he assumed 50 that such a simple method of weed control as plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated 55 that the method can be effective.Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip60 at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas 65 only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.This method of weed control is currently being used by several farmers in Germany. Because many of the same weed species that invade farmers' fields70 in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world, this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact, recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon, Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina support this idea.

Question: The passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been
Choices:
  A: lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
  B: higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.
  C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
  D: comparable to Hartmann's original projection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  In a pilot experiment in Germany, Karl Hartmann demonstrated that plowing fields at night is a more effective method for controlling weed growth than plowing during the day. More than 80% of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds. 
  The pilot experiments did not involve planting wheat or corn, so it is unclear how the presence of these crops would have affected the results.
  The passage does not provide any indication that Hartmann or anyone else made a projection about weed growth if wheat or corn had been planted in the agricultural strips.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The farmer Karl Seydel tested plowing at midday and plowing at night to determine if plowing at night minimized the germination of weed seeds.
  A: No crops were planted in the two agricultural strips tested by Seydel. It is difficult to conclude what the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would be if crops were planted.
  B: There is no evidence in the passage that supports this claim.
  C: The passage provides the results of Sommer's experiments, so it is not impossible for Hartmann to determine the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.
  D: In the experiment, more than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. 
  The results of Hartmann's experiment were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
According to the passage, if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The experiment conducted by Hartmann involved plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany, where no crops were planted yet.
  The results of the experiment showed that more than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  The passage does not provide any information on what would happen if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  - Hartmann conducted experiments on two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany.
  - In these pilot experiments, no crops were planted in order to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  - The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip at night.
  - More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  
  Based on the information above, it can be inferred that the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment because the crops would have been competing for resources with the emerging weeds. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The experiment described in the passage showed that plowing at night reduced the percentage of the field covered by weeds compared to plowing during the day.
  The experiment was done without crops planted, so the effect of plowing at night on crops is not directly addressed in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Karl Hartmann's experiment showed that plowing fields at night instead of during the day can be an effective method for weed control. Hartmann believes that plowing during the day can briefly expose buried weed seeds to sunlight and stimulate their germination, whereas plowing at night when photon fluence rate is low can minimize germination. Pilot experiments showed that more than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds. However, no crops were planted in the pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with weeds.

Analysis:
  The question asks about what might have happened if Seydel had planted crops in Hartmann's experiment. The passage does not directly provide a clear answer to this question, but it suggests that the results might have been different if crops were planted instead of none. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  In the pilot experiments, Seydel plowed two agricultural strips at different times to test whether the time of day of plowing had an effect on weed growth. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  The passage does not provide information about how wheat or corn would have affected the amount of weed growth in the agricultural strips.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  In Hartmann's experiment, he plowed two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany without planting any crops.
  More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  The text does not provide any information about how planting crops would affect the results of the experiment.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The experiment conducted by Hartmann of plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany showed that plowing at midday led to more weed growth than plowing at night. However, no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. 
A: Lowering the chances of weed growth in a field would involve the growth of crops to compete with the weeds and hence reducing their growth. This choice contradicts the information in the passage that no crops were planted in the experiment, so it is not a likely answer.
B: The experiment showed that plowing the field during the day can stimulate weed germination given the exposure to sunlight. Therefore, if crops were planted in the field, the percentage of the surface of the strip covered with weeds would likely be high given the competition between the crops and the weeds to access sunlight and other resources. This choice aligns with the information in the passage, so it is a likely answer. 
C: The passage provides information on the weed growth of the agricultural strips while avoiding possible competition with the emerging weeds. Hence, it would not have been nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine whether or not the percentage of the surface would be higher or lower than the percentage he predicted if crops were planted on the strips. This choice cannot be justified from the information given in the passage, so it is an unlikely answer.
D: The passage does not provide any Hartmann's original projection on whether or not planting crops could reduce the growth of weeds in the agricultural strips. This choice cannot be justified from the information given in the passage, so it is an unlikely answer.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, "Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."40 He picked up a bird shape: "Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought." He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: "Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind."As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. "Look here," Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. "See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this." And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. "The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price."I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.
Question: In Passage 1, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely
Choices:
  A: overlooked, because few men are interested in women's thoughts about politics.
  B: indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life.
  C: unnecessary, because men are able to govern society themselves.
  D: symbolic, because women tend to be more idealistic about politics than men are.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the duties and influence of women in society. It mentions that women have an important and all-pervading influence, but the way they gain influence and power is different from that of men. Men can use public debate, coercion, and physical force to influence society, but women can only appeal to kindness, generosity, and peacefulness. Women's power is thus limited to the domestic and social sphere.
  A: This is not supported by Passage 1.
  B: This matches the description of women's influence in Passage 1. Women are expected to cultivate themselves so that their opinions are respected, and they can influence their fathers, husbands, and sons through love, respect, and gentleness. 
  C: This is not supported by Passage 1. It emphasizes the importance of women's influence in society.
  D: This is not discussed in Passage 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the role of women in society and how their power and influence differ from those of men.
  A: This choice is contradicted by the passage, which states that women's influence is "all-pervading" but that they exert their power in different ways than men do.
  B: This choice accurately reflects one of the main arguments in Passage 1 about the unique ways in which women can wield their influence.
  C: This choice is contradicted by the passage, which argues that women's influence is important and powerful.
  D: This choice is not directly addressed in the passage and is not a major focus of the discussion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the different modes of exercising power for men and women, and argues that women's power should come from their kindness, generosity, and peaceful nature in the domestic and social circle, rather than from coercion or physical force.
  A: The passage does not mention men's interest in women's thoughts about politics.
  B: The passage suggests that women have a significant and all-pervading influence in society, even though they hold a subordinate position to men. Their influence, according to the passage, should come from their cultivation, refinement, and benevolence within the domestic and social circle.
  C: The passage does not suggest that men are better suited to govern society than women.
  D: The passage does not suggest that women are more idealistic about politics than men are.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: In Passage 1, Beecher is discussing the role of women in society. She argues that while women hold a subordinate position, their role is still important and influential. Beecher discusses the ways that men and women exert power and influence in society, arguing that women should do so in a different way than men. Beecher also argues that women should focus on cultivating their intellect, benevolence, and refinement in order to gain influence through respect, esteem, and love.

Analysis: None of the answer choices fully captures Beecher's argument in Passage 1. While B is the closest to the correct answer, it is not entirely accurate. Beecher does argue that women's influence is important and pervades society, but she does not suggest that it is limited to the home and family life. Instead, Beecher argues that women should exercise their influence in a manner that is different from the way that men exercise theirs.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes the nature of the influence women can have in society.
  A: This choice is incorrect, as Beecher does not discuss men's interest in women's thoughts about politics.
  B: This choice correctly summarizes Beecher's argument in Passage 1. He argues that women can have a powerful influence on society from within the home and family.
  C: This choice is incorrect. Beecher does not suggest that men alone are capable of governing society.
  D: This choice is incorrect. While Beecher suggests that women may have a more idealistic approach to gaining influence and power, he does not discuss the role of symbolism in women's effect on public life.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the role of women in society, their subordination to men in certain respects, and the manner in which they can exert appropriate influence over men. 
  A: This answer is not supported by the passage. 
  B: This answer is a correct summary of Beecher's argument in Passage 1. She argues that while women hold a subordinate position, their duties and influence are no less important than men's. However, the mode of gaining influence and exercising power should be different for women, and they should win everything by peace and love in the domestic and social circle. 
  C: This answer is not supported by the passage. Beecher does not argue that men are able to govern society themselves. 
  D: This answer is not supported by the passage. Beecher does not discuss women's idealism or lack thereof about politics. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the role of women in society and their mode of gaining influence and exercising power.
  A: The passage does not mention anything about men's interest in women's thoughts about politics as a reason for why women's effect on public life is largely overlooked.
  B: The passage suggests that women's influence is all-pervading and important, but that it is exercised in a different and peculiar way compared to men. Women are to win everything by peace and love, by making themselves respected and loved, and by appealing to kindly, generous, peaceful, and benevolent principles. Their power and conquests are lawful only if they adhere to these principles and are within the domestic and social circle. Therefore, B is a correct answer.
  C: The passage does not suggest that men should govern society alone or that women have no role to play in governance.
  D: The passage does not mention anything about women being more idealistic about politics than men as a reason for their symbolic effect on public life.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes the role of women in society and their modes of exercising power and influence.

There is no mention of Beecher implying anything specific about women's effect on public life.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the role of women in society and how they can gain influence and power within their sphere of influence, which is primarily the domestic and social circle. The text emphasizes that women have an important role to play, but it is a different and unique one compared to men.
  A: This is not implied in Passage 1, which does not address men's interest in women's thoughts on politics.
  B: This is the correct implication. Passage 1 suggests that women exert their influence primarily within the sphere of the home and family life and can gain respect, admiration, and influence by being cultivated, refined, benevolent, unassuming, and easy to be entreated. Women can exert a peaceful and benevolent influence on fathers, husbands, and sons, without needing to resort to coercion or competition.
  C: This is not implied in Passage 1, which does not address the necessity or ability of men to govern society themselves.
  D: This is not implied in Passage 1, which does not address women's idealism or lack thereof compared to men.

  D: Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge: Passage 1 discusses the subordinate position of women in society and describes the ways in which women can exert influence without going beyond the boundaries of their sphere. Passage 2 argues that the investigation of the rights of slaves has led the author to better understand her own rights as a woman and that human beings have rights based on their moral nature rather than their physical characteristics, such as sex. The author also argues that women have the same rights and responsibilities as men and that their duties originate from the diversity of their relations in life and the different eras in which they live.

Action: Answer("D") 
Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1, such as the moral nature of human beings and the ways in which women can exert influence without going beyond the boundaries of their sphere. While there is some overlap between the passages in their discussion of the rights of women, Passage 2 takes a broader approach to the question of human rights and does not directly address the practical strategies for exerting influence that are described in Passage 1. Therefore, "elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1" is the best answer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: Passage 1 discusses the subordination of women in society and their power to influence others through kindness and benevolence. Passage 2 discusses the anti-slavery movement and argues that women should have the same rights and responsibilities as men because they are both moral beings. It also argues that gender is insignificant when it comes to moral duties. 
Action: Answer("D") - Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.
Response 2:
Knowledge: Passage 2 refers to the "investigation of the rights of the slave" and argues that human beings have rights based on their moral nature. It also argues that gender does not give men higher rights and responsibilities than women. 
Passage 1 discusses the role of women in society and argues that women have all-pervading and important influences in society, but that they should gain influence and exercise power in a different way than men. The passage argues that women should win everything by peace and love, making themselves respected, esteemed, and loved. 
Action: Answer("D") Since Passage 2 does not directly address the topic discussed in Passage 1, but rather elaborates upon several ideas that are implicit in the discussion of human rights and gender equality, we can conclude that the best choice is D: Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the social roles and modes of influence available for women and men in society, arguing that women should seek to gain influence through peaceful and benevolent means, primarily in the domestic and social circle.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

Question: The passage most strongly suggests that beekeepers' attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides have what unintentional effect?
Choices:
  A: They increase certain mite populations.
  B: They kill some beneficial forms of bacteria.
  C: They destroy bees' primary food source.
  D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how mites feed on bee hemolymph and can kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Bee colonies fed only mono-crops might be nutritionally deficient and could be vulnerable to mite infestations that could be fatal. Commercially produced insecticides might be introduced into their hives by beekeepers in an effort to fight mite infestation.
A: There is no evidence presented in the passage that suggests that beekeepers' attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides increase certain mite populations.
B: There is no reference in the passage that suggests that beekeepers' attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides kill some beneficial forms of bacteria.
C: There is no information in the passage that suggests that beekeepers' attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides destroy bees' primary food source.
D: The passage suggests that the attempts of beekeepers to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides further harm the health of some bees that are already immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient due to, among other conditions, mono-crop diets.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that beekeepers use commercially produced insecticides to fight mite infestations.
  The passage suggests that bees of commercial bee colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient due to a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins, namely, pyrethrums.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.
Question: It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that the main reason that the narrator considers Great Expectations to be the best gift he ever received is because

  Sempere, the bookseller, gives the narrator an old volume of "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens" as a Christmas gift.
  The narrator reads "Great Expectations" nine times and considers learning to do what Mr. Dickens had done.
Action: Answer("A")  
Based on the passage's description of how the narrator was fascinated by words and the mystery of their hidden science and saw in them a key with which he could unlock a boundless world, it can be inferred that reading "Great Expectations" convinced him that he wanted to be a writer.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The narrator of the passage loves to read books and considers them a safe haven from his troubled life.
  The narrator had a difficult relationship with his father, who did not allow books in the house and did not want his son to read.
  Sempere \& Sons bookshop is the narrator's sanctuary and refuge. 
  The narrator received Great Expectations from Sempere as a gift and read it nine times, considering it to be the best gift he had ever received.
Action: Answer("A") 
Reasoning: The most reasonable inference from the passage is that reading Great Expectations convinced the narrator that he wanted to be a writer. Throughout the passage, the narrator expresses his love for books and fascination with words, which he sees as a key to unlock a boundless world. His sanctuary is the Sempere & Sons bookshop, and he spends his coins on buying books.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: The data in table 2 best support which statement about the woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey?
Choices:
  A: At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
  B: After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether.
  C: After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
  D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses woodpecker finches and their unique levering technique to acquire prey. The passage notes that individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild, most likely because our artificial crevices differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some point during the study, each of these birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice. After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses an experimental study on woodpecker finches and their ability to use tools to acquire prey. Five individuals developed a unique technique of using a levering motion with their beaks to retrieve prey from artificial crevices. They increased their use of this technique after initial success. Table 2 shows the number of times each individual attempted and successfully acquired prey using this levering technique.
  
  A: There is no information in the passage to support this statement.
  B: There is no information in the passage to support this statement.
  C: Table 2 shows that one of the individuals attempted the technique seven times and was successful on the seventh attempt. The others attempted the technique between one and four times and were successful on their first or second attempt. Therefore, this statement is not supported by the data in Table 2.
  D: This statement is not supported by the data in Table 2. The data shows that all five individuals were successful in using the levering technique to acquire prey. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Table 2 is not included in the context.
  The passage mentions that five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild. They levered the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice after dropping the tool into the artificial crevice and pulling it out with an upward motion of their beak, and they significantly increased their use of this method after initial success.
Action: Answer("C") 
Given that none of these individuals attempted the technique more than five times after their initial success at acquiring the prey, choice C is the best answer.
Response 3:
Knowledge: Table 2 is not provided in the context. No information is given on how many attempts were made by the woodpecker finches using the unique levering technique before successfully acquiring prey.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses an experimental study of woodpecker finches that examined whether tool use in these birds is acquired socially or genetically predetermined. The study found that young woodpecker finches that did not have the opportunity to observe tool use were still able to develop this ability with similar aptitude and reach distinct developmental steps as their siblings that were given the opportunity to observe tool use. The study concluded that genetic components play a stronger role than social learning in the development of tool use in woodpecker finches. Additionally, the study found that individual learning plays an important role in serving to improve the efficiency of the woodpecker finches' tool use behavior.
  
  Table 2 of the passage provides data on the frequency of tool use among woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey. The table shows that, among the five birds that used this technique, four of them increased their use of this method over time, while one bird maintained consistent use throughout the study. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses an experimental study with woodpecker finches to investigate whether tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired socially. The study used a tool-using model and a non-tool-using model to rear woodpecker finches. The study found that young woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to watch tool use develop this ability with similar aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were given the chance to observe tool use in adult woodpecker finches. The developmental process seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components, and the passage notes that the ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is determined by a very specific genetic component but is enhanced through individual learning.
  
Table 2 in the passage shows that after each of the five individuals with the unique levering technique was successful in acquiring prey:
 - Bird 1 used the technique only four times more.
 - Bird 2 used the technique 14 times more.
 - Bird 3 used the technique 38 times more.
 - Bird 4 used the technique 28 times more.
 - Bird 5 used the technique 26 times more.

Action: Answer("C")  
The data in table 2 supports the statement that after the first success at acquiring the prey, none of the birds attempted the unique levering technique more than five times. Therefore, the answer is (C).
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses an experimental study of the woodpecker finches, in which they were split into two groups and raised with either a tool-using model or a non-tool-using model. The study found that young woodpecker finches could develop the ability to use tools without the need for social learning and that the developmental process for this behavior seemed to be dependent on genetically fixed components. The passage also discusses how woodpecker finches' solitary lifestyle could be a reason for the strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this species. In addition, the passage describes how individual learning played an important role in enhancing the efficiency of tool use behavior in woodpecker finches, as they developed unique techniques for acquiring prey.

Action: Answer("C")  
The data in table 2 suggest that after the first success at acquiring the prey, none of the five woodpecker finches attempted the unique levering technique more than five times.
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage describes the ontogenetic unfolding of the woodpecker finches' tool-using behavior, which is based on a specific genetic component that is enhanced through individual learning. The passage also mentions that five birds developed a unique levering technique to acquire prey in the artificial crevices, and after the initial success with this technique, all five birds significantly increased their use of this method.

Answer: 
Action: Answer("C")
The data in table 2 suggest that, after the first success at acquiring prey using the unique levering technique, none of the birds attempted the technique more than five times.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses an experimental study on woodpecker finches and their use of tools to acquire prey.
  The study found that the woodpecker finches demonstrated individual learning, as they developed a unique levering technique to acquire prey that differed from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.
  The study also found that the developmental process for the woodpecker finches' tool use behavior seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components.
  The passage mentions that the study altered our conception of how this behavior develops, given the very specific genetic component determining this complex behavior, but is enhanced through individual learning.

Action: Answer("C")  
Based on the given choices, the data in table 2 of the passage best support statement C: "After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times." The table shows that five birds successfully used the levering technique and that the number of attempts each bird made to use the technique ranged from one to five. Therefore, the data do not support statements A or B. Additionally, the passage does not mention whether any of the birds were unsuccessful in their first attempt with the technique, so statement D is not supported.
Response 9:

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

  The passage describes the arrival of Miss Spivey, a new schoolteacher in Threestep, Georgia. She is portrayed as a well-traveled woman and an enthusiastic educator who wants to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America. In the classroom, Miss Spivey shows her students a map of her travels and talks about her experiences, but the students are most fascinated by a button on a string that reveals the map behind the blackboard. When one of the students asks what Miss Spivey studied at Barnard College, Ralphord, Miss Spivey's little brother, asks what Barnard College is, which prompts Miss Spivey to explain both schools to the class.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord is intended to introduce them as siblings and to show that Ralphord is either too young or too uninformed to know what Barnard College is, despite Miss Spivey's expectation that everyone would know about it. The passage does not suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge, nor does it establish a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor. It also does not demonstrate that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions. Instead, the passage suggests that Miss Spivey is initially dismissive of Ralphord's question, but then takes the time to explain both Barnard College and Columbia University to the class.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis," says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. "Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth," Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. "We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment," Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 "standard of care treatment." That's going to take five years and $\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.
Question: Information in Passage 2 best supports which conclusion about the mice in the experiment described in Passage 1?
Choices:
  A: Exposure to teixobactin made them less susceptible to subsequent upper respiratory tract infections.
  B: Gram-positive bacteria enhanced the effectiveness of teixobactin against their upper respiratory tract infections.
  C: Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
  D: Teixobactin attacked the proteins of the bacteria that caused their upper respiratory tract infections.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes an experiment where mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
  Passage 2 discusses the recent discovery of teixobactin, and notes that it kills Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, and does not kill Gram-negative bacteria.
Action: Answer("C")  
The information in Passage 2 best supports the conclusion that the upper respiratory tract infections in the mice were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria, as teixobactin (which was effective against the infections) does not kill Gram-negative bacteria.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes an experiment in which mice infected with bacteria causing upper respiratory tract infections were treated with teixobactin, which proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, and knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
  Passage 2 discusses the isolation and cultivation of soil bacteria to find new antibiotics, and briefly mentions the discovery of teixobactin and its effectiveness against Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, and the tuberculosis bacterium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes an experiment where mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
  Passage 2 discusses the process by which the team was able to isolate and grow individual soil bacteria that can't normally be grown in the laboratory, and how this could lead to the discovery of new antibiotics.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
The passage does not provide any information that supports option A, B or D. In fact, Passage 1 describes how teixobactin was effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae; and how it attacks the lipid molecules that the bacterial cell creates organically which breaks down bacterial cell walls. Therefore, the information in Passage 2 best supports option C, that the upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria as teixobactin was only effective against gram-positive bacteria.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes an experiment with mice infected with gram-positive bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections, which were treated with teixobactin.
  Passage 2 provides additional information about the discovery of teixobactin as a promising antibiotic, but does not provide any specific information about the experiment described in Passage 1.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a study in which teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, including those that have developed immunity to other drugs. It was effective in curing infections in mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects. 
  Passage 2 also describes the same study and teixobactin as a new antibiotic derived from soil bacteria that killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, cured experimental infection in mice, and killed the tuberculosis bacterium. 
Action: Answer("C") 
The passage talks about the positive, effective results of the study with teixobactin. However, no information in Passage 2 supports any of the options. The only information that may be related to the correct answer is that in Passage 1, the mice were infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections which include Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but there is no information to support option A or B. The passage provides no information in support of option D. Therefore, the most likely answer is that their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes an experiment in which teixobactin was tested on mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections.
  Teixobactin was effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those that have developed immunity to other drugs.
  The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically.
  Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to produce different structures.
  
  Passage 2 discusses the researchers' ability to isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be grown in the laboratory-in soil itself.
  The first new antibiotic that they've found by this approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less effective against Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. 
  
Action: Answer("C") 
Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the mice's upper respiratory tract infections were likely caused by gram-positive bacteria, since teixobactin was effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, including Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but is less effective against Gram-negative opportunists.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes an experiment where mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections were treated with teixobactin and this drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects. Teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, even those that have developed immunity to other drugs. The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically.
  
  Passage 2 discusses the methodology used to isolate and cultivate new soil bacteria that have not been grown before. It also describes the discovery of teixobactin from Eleftheria terrae bacteria. Teixobactin kills Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory and cured experimental infection in mice. Teixobactin also killed the tuberculosis bacterium. 
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Based on the information given in the passages, the best conclusion that can be drawn about the mice in the experiment described in Passage 1 is that their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria. The experiment tested teixobactin against bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections, but there is no information to suggest that the infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria or that gram-positive bacteria enhanced the effectiveness of teixobactin. Furthermore, the drug targets bacterial cell walls by attacking lipid molecules, not proteins.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a study where teixobactin, a new antibiotic, was found to be effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, including those that have developed immunity to other drugs.
  In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off the bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) without any noticeable toxic effects.
  Passage 2 discusses the isolation and cultivation of individual soil bacteria, including types that can't normally be grown in the laboratory, as a gateway to cultivating potentially antibiotic-producing bacteria that have never been grown before. Viability of teixobactin for commercial production and clinical trial is discussed.
Action: Answer("C")  
The article in Passage 1 provides no evidence that upper respiratory tract infections in the mice were caused by gram-negative bacteria versus gram-positive bacteria or any other type of bacteria. Therefore, we cannot conclude that either gram-positive bacteria or gram-negative bacteria enhanced or reduced the effectiveness of teixobactin against the mice's infections. Answer (A) is incorrect because there is no evidence in either passage that exposure to teixobactin made the mice less susceptible to subsequent upper respiratory tract infections. Answer (D) is incorrect because the article in Passage 1 specifically states that teixobactin doesn't attack the bacteria's proteins but rather breaks down the bacterial cell walls by attacking lipid molecules. Answer (C) is the most likely answer because the article in Passage 1 describes tests against bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections and Passage 2 highlights the difficulty and novelty in cultivating types of soil bacteria that haven't been grown before. Therefore, the likeliest explanation is that the mice's infections were caused by gram-positive bacteria.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses teixobactin, a promising antibiotic that was effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those that have developed immunity to other drugs. The best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it. Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects. Teixobactin breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically.

  In Passage 2, a recent study allowed researchers to isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. The first new antibiotic that they've found by this approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed the tuberculosis bacterium.

Action: Answer("C")  
The passage 2 tells us that teixobactin was effective against Gram-positive bacteria, which cause upper respiratory tract infections. We can infer that the upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes the discovery of a promising antibiotic, teixobactin, which was effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria including those that have developed immunity to other drugs.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: According to the passage, which statement best explains why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close?
Choices:
  A: The second trigger produces an electrical charge that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger.
  B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
  C: The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open.
  D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap encodes the information of its prey by an electric charge produced from the touch of a hair on its leaf.
  A single touch on a hair is not enough to induce the trap to close.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium so that a second increase triggered by the touch of a second hair can push the total concentration of calcium over the threshold and induce the trap to close.
  If the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap needs to be sure its prey is large enough to be worth the energy required to close its trap. 
  The Venus flytrap uses its trigger hairs to literally feel and detect its prey.
  Touching only one trigger hair is not enough to close the trap. 
  A second hair needs to be touched within about 20 seconds to push the concentration of calcium ions over the threshold to close the trap. 
  Touching just one trigger hair causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap. 
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close, which can only be achieved after a second hair triggers a second electric potential.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus Flytrap only wants to close its trap when it is sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The Venus Flytrap can feel its prey using the large black hairs on its lobes acting as triggers that spring the trap shut when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action. 
  According to Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany, the Venus flytrap's encoding of information is based on an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap, causing an increase in the concentration of calcium ions. To spring the flytrap's trap, a second hair on the Venus Flytrap must be triggered to push the calcium concentration over the threshold to close the trap. If the second hair is not stimulated quickly enough, the concentration of calcium ions decreases, and the memory of the first hair trigger is lost.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap needs a second trigger hair to be touched by an insect in a short amount of time in order for its trap to close. 
  The Venus flytrap's trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close, and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap needs a second trigger hair to be touched to close its trap.
  Touching one trigger hair alone doesn't produce enough calcium concentration to close the trap.
  The electric charge produced by touching the first trigger hair causes the calcium channels to open.
  The model proposed by Hodick and Sievers suggests that the information is stored in the electric charge of the leaf. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  Without a second trigger within a short amount of time, the memory of the first trigger is lost due to dissipating calcium ion concentration.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Venus flytraps close their traps only when they are sure that the prey that has touched their leaves is large enough to be worth their time because it requires an enormous energy expense to close the trap and several hours to reopen it. They need to encode and store the information of the encounter with potential prey in order to react upon the second hair that is touched, which they do by bringing about a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane through an electric action potential followed by calcium ion channels opening.
  A: This statement is not supported by the passage as there is no mention of a reversal of charge produced by either trigger hair.
  B: This statement accurately represents the essential role of the second trigger which provides stability to the initial calcium ions surge and allowing the total calcium concentration to exceed the threshold necessary to close the trap.
  C: This statement is an incomplete explanation since calcium channels open after the first touch with the hair which trigger electric action potentials.
  D: This statement presents a partial explanation of the flytrap's response but does not fully explain what happens when the second hair is touched.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time to ensure that enough calcium ions accumulate, and the concentration of calcium ions dissipates over time.
A: The passage does not mention an electrical charge produced by the second trigger hair that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger hair. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
B: The passage does not mention the second trigger hair stabilizing the surge of calcium ions produced by the first trigger hair. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
C: The passage states that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap. It's the opening of calcium channels that is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to why the Venus fly trap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time.
D: The proposed model explains that the Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold. If the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost. This explanation suggests that the second trigger hair provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger hair. Hence, D is the correct answer.

  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  Therefore the second trigger provides a supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these "low-threshold" nerves "C-tactile," or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations
Question: Based on the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected which condition to result from the blocking of fast fibers?
Choices:
  A: The rate at which other nerve fibers fired would increase.
  B: The test subject would perceive gentle stimuli as painful.
  C: The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
  D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Textbooks in the early 1990s believed that pressure and vibration could only be sensed by fast-signaling nerve fibers, and that blocking these fibers eliminated the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers reduced sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Based on the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected the body to compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure if fast fibers were blocked. This can be inferred from the passage where it says that "Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock." (lines 9-12), which suggests that the body can still sense pressure through slow fibers when fast fibers are blocked. Therefore, the correct answer is C: The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains that in the early 1990s it was believed that sensations of pressure and vibration were carried only by myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers that also gave information about location. Blocking these fibers eliminated the sensation of pressure altogether, while blocking slow fibers only reduced sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.

Action: Answer("D")

Therefore, based on the passage, if the fast fibers were blocked, the ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired. However, this option is not explicitly mentioned in the choices. Among the given choices, "B" and "C" are not supported by the information in the passage, while "A" is not relevant to the explanation in the passage.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Textbooks in the early 1990s believed that fast-signaling nerve fibers provided information about location and sensations of pressure and vibration, but myelinated, slow-conducting fibers were believed to only respond to pain and temperature. Experiments suggested that slow fibers only reduced sensitivity to warmth or painful shock, while blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.
Action: Answer("B") 
The passage suggests that textbook authors in the early 1990s would have expected the blocking of fast fibers to result in the perception of gentle stimuli as painful. (Choice B)
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  - Textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that sensations of pressure and vibration only traveled along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers.
  - Experiments showed that blocking fast fibers eliminated the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only reduced sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that nerves that only responded to two types of stimuli, pain or temperature, were slow-conducting. 
  Sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to only travel along fast-signaling, myelinated nerve fibers.
  Blocking fast fibers was thought to eliminate sensations of pressure.
  Slow fibers were thought to only reduce sensitivity to warmth or small painful shock when blocked.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Textbooks in the early 1990s believed that sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers that also gave information about location.
  Blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.

Action: Answer("C")  
According to the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected that the body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure if fast fibers were blocked. This expectation is based on the finding in the experiments described in the passage that blocking fast fibers eliminated the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only reduced sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock. Therefore, it seems that slow fibers are also involved in sensing pressure, and the body may rely on them in the absence of fast fibers. Choice C is the best answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how experiments blocking nerve fibers supported the notion that sensations of pressure and vibration travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Preventing fast fibers from firing seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of stimuli: pain and temperature.

Knowledge: 
  In the early 1990s, textbooks believed that sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Blocking fast fibers was believed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.
  A: The passage does not mention that blocking fast fibers would increase the rate at which other nerve fibers fired.
  B: The passage does not mention that blocking fast fibers would cause gentle stimuli to be perceived as painful.
  C: The passage mentions that experiments blocking nerve fibers showed that preventing fast fibers from firing seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock. While the presence of slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure was not initially recognized, the subsequent experiments showed their existence. Therefore, C is not the expected outcome of blocking fast fibers.
  D: The passage does not mention the ability to perceive vibrations to be impaired by blocking fast fibers.
Action: Answer("B")

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the different types of asteroids in the asteroid belt and how they may have been formed and disrupted over time. The passage suggests that primitive asteroids, rather than differentiated asteroids, may have been more common and that the surviving asteroids in the asteroid belt today are a mixture of both intact primitive bodies and fragments of differentiated asteroids, including iron meteorites.
  
  A: The passage does suggest that primitive asteroids are common in the asteroid belt, and they are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, but it does not provide evidence that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt is in primitive asteroids.
  
  B: The passage does mention that a few asteroids have spectra that match those of mantle rocks, and mantle rocks are rocky material that formed the mantles of differentiated asteroids, but it does not provide evidence that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt is in basaltic asteroids.
  
  C: The passage does not provide evidence that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt is in high-reflection asteroids. It does not discuss the relationship between mass and reflectivity, and it only briefly mentions spectra as a characteristic of a few asteroids.
  
  D: The passage suggests that iron objects are stronger and more likely to survive in the asteroid belt than rocky fragments, which may have been ground down to dust and lost over time. It also suggests that the surviving asteroids in the asteroid belt today are a mixture of both intact primitive bodies and fragments of differentiated asteroids, including iron meteorites.

Knowledge:
  The passage mentions that the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. 
  The passage also talks about differentiated asteroids and suggests that they were relatively rare to begin with and none have survived. 
  It also mentions that the missing mantle problem is a long-standing puzzle, and that iron fragments survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart. 
  The passage provides some possible explanations for why iron parent bodies are more common than rocky ones in the asteroid belt. 

Action: Answer("D")  
The data in the table provides information on the reflectivity of asteroids, which is directly related to how much sunlight they reflect. According to the passage, rocky fragments are more likely to have been removed from asteroids than iron fragments, and therefore there may be fewer asteroids in the belt that are high in reflectivity. The table shows that a large majority (about 77%) of the asteroids in the belt have low reflectivity, which supports the conclusion that most asteroids in the belt are low in reflectivity and therefore likely to be composed of rocky material. Therefore, the best answer is D: low in reflectivity.

  The passage talks about the composition and survivability of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  A: The passage does not provide enough evidence to support this option.
  B: The passage does not provide enough evidence to support this option.
  C: The passage does not indicate that reflectivity is related to the mass of asteroids. Also, the passage says that Vesta has a high reflectivity which is not typical of the majority of asteroids.
  D: The passage suggests that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt is in the form of iron, which suggests that asteroids with a low reflectivity (presumably those made of rocky material) are not as abundant as asteroids with a high reflectivity (presumably those made of iron).

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: If Meltzer’s findings (Passage 2) are accurate, what can most reasonably be inferred about the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1?
Choices:
  A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  B: They are a product of the global cooling that occurred during the Younger Dryas period.
  C: They were found in highest concentrations at Clovis archaeological sites.
  D: They may have played some role in the tool technology of the Clovis people.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a group of scientists who presented studies arguing that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, causing temperatures to plunge for the next millennium, which is known as Younger Dryas.
  The team argues that its idea explains multiple observations: not only the climate cooling and the disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large mammals.
  The evidence presented by the team of scientists comes in the form of geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America—9 of them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of glass and carbon, and amounts of the element iridium said to be too high to have originated on Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of carbonized material, which the team says are the remains of wildfires that swept across the continent after the impact.
  Passage 2 describes a team of researchers led by David Meltzer who examined the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a theory that argues that a comet or asteroid explosion may have caused the climate cooling and the extinction of Clovis hunters and large mammals in North America. Geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at archaeological sites across North America was used as evidence to support this theory.
  Passage 2 discusses a study that challenges the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, including claims of finding iridium, microscopic diamonds, and magnetic particles in deposits at sites dated back to 12,800 years ago. The study examined the dating quality and accuracy of 29 sites across the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision. The team led by Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University, argues that only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.

  Passage 2 describes a team led by David Meltzer who looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision and argues that when the quality and accuracy of the dating is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago, and the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses a team of scientists who argue that a comet or asteroid caused an impact on Earth approximately 13,000 years ago, leading to the onset of the Younger Dryas cooling period, which caused a series of events, including the disappearance of the Clovis hunters.
  The team used geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at archaeological sites - 9 of them Clovis - to identify debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact. They found spherules of glass and carbon and amounts of the element iridium, too high to have originated on Earth. The team suggests that these spherules may have formed due to an extraterrestrial impact.
  In passage 2, researchers from Southern Methodist University assert that when the quality and accuracy of the dating techniques used to date 29 different archaeological sites across the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East are closely examined, only three of the 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago.
Action: Answer("A")  
Since Meltzer's findings provide evidence that only three sites reported by impact advocates fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset and the supposed impact fails on both theoretical and empirical grounds, it can reasonably be inferred that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the onset of the Younger Dryas. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a theory that a comet or asteroid exploded above the northern ice cap about 13,000 years ago, which could have caused debris to rain down on North America and caused a millennium-long cooling period known as the Younger Dryas. 
  The team of scientists presented evidence of this theory in the form of geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America—including 9 Clovis sites—that contained debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact, such as glass and carbon spherules, and amounts of the element iridium said to be too high to have originated on Earth.
  
  Passage 2 presents a criticism of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. David Meltzer and team argue that when you look at the dating of 29 different sites, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the timeframe of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years. 

Action: Answer("A") 
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes a team of scientists who argued that a comet or asteroid impacted the earth's northern ice cap 13,000 years ago.
  This impact showered debris across North America and caused temperatures to plunge for the next millennium.
  The team argued that this impact caused the extinction of the continent's large mammals, including the Clovis hunters.
  Geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America revealed the debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact, including spherules of glass and carbon, and amounts of the element iridium.
  Passage 2 introduces David Meltzer's new study, which looks at the dating of 29 different sites worldwide, including those in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision.
  Meltzer argues that only three out of 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  He states that the popular appeal of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis is probably due to the way it provides simple explanations for complex problems.
  Richard Firestone, a nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, still stands behind the impact hypothesis.
 
Action: Answer("A") 
If Meltzer's findings in Passage 2 are accurate and only three out of 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, it can be most reasonably inferred that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas. Therefore, the best answer choice is "A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas."

  Passage 1 describes a team of scientists arguing that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, causing temperatures to plunge for the next millennium. They suggest that this idea explains multiple observations, including the near-simultaneous extinction of the continent's large mammals, and the disappearance of the Clovis hunters. The team's new evidence came from a geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America, which suggest that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of glass and carbon and amounts of the element iridium said to be too high to have originated on Earth.
  Passage 2 provides a critique of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. The paper argues that when the quality and accuracy of the dating, which was based on radiocarbon and other techniques, is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites of the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East that impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.

Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a team of scientists presenting evidence that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, causing temperatures to plunge for the next millennium, which is known as the Younger Dryas. 
  The evidence presented in Passage 1 comes in the form of geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America, 9 of which were Clovis sites.
  Certain features of the sedimentary layers suggest that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact, and these include spherules of glass and carbon, and amounts of the element iridium said to be too high to have originated on Earth.
  Passage 2 challenges the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis and looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which the impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage 2 which talks about the same topic argues that when the dating of the archaeological sites that were proposed as evidence for Younger Dryas impact hypothesis is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands of years).
  
  In Passage 1, a team argued that the debris suggested by geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at many archaeological sites across North America contains spherules of glass and carbon which they suggested were formed by an extraterrestrial impact of a comet or asteroid almost 13,000 years ago and had caused multiple observations including climate cooling and the extinction of Clovis hunters. 
  
Action: Answer("A")  
If Meltzer's findings are accurate, it can most reasonably be inferred that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas because the dating of the supposed archaeological sites based on which the team argued the hypothesis, only three sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a team's argument for the theory that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago which showered debris across North America and caused temperatures to plunge for the next millennium.
  The team claims that their idea explains the climate cooling, disappearance of the Clovis hunters, and the near-simultaneous extinction of the continent's large mammals.
  The team defends their idea with geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America, some of them Clovis sites.
  The features of the layers suggest that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact, including spherules of glass and carbon, and amounts of the element iridium (which is rare on Earth) that are too high to have originated on Earth.
  Passage 2 discusses findings that examine the dating of these sites and argue that only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her50 reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an55 orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....Consider, sir, dispassionately, these60 observations-for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, "that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it65 was impossible to explain." If so, on what does your constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this70 country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman-prescription.Consider-I address you as a legislatorwhether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their75 own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift 80 of reason?In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be 85 useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Follow the money and you will end up in space. That's the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on mining beyond Earth.Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for 5 Space Engineering Research, the event brought together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar scientists, and government agencies that are all working to make space mining a reality.The forum comes hot on the heels of the 102012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms. Planetary Resources of Washington says it will launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years, while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020 . Another15 commercial venture that sprung up in 2012, Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to the moon, including to potential lunar miners.Within a few decades, these firms may be meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as20 platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital for personal electronics, such as yttrium and lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who transformed the western United States, the first space miners won't just enrich themselves. They also hope25 to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds with Earth, in which the materials extracted and processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered for space-based projects.In this scenario, water mined from other 30 worlds could become the most desired commodity. "In the desert, what's worth more: a kilogram of gold or a kilogram of water?" asks Kris Zacny of HoneyBee Robotics in New York. "Gold is useless. Water will let you live."35 Water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary 40 refuelling stations. Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into 45 concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.\section{Passage 2}The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting from discovery to economics. The past year has seen a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few0 billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain: the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could enrich us all.But before the miners start firing up their rockets, we should pause for thought. At first glance, space55 mining seems to sidestep most environmental concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids, and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences -both here on Earth and in space -merit careful consideration.60 Part of this is about principles. Some will argue that space's "magnificent desolation" is not ours to despoil, just as they argue that our own planet's poles should remain pristine. Others will suggest that glutting ourselves on space's riches is not an65 acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable ways of earthly life.History suggests that those will be hard lines to hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public that such barren environments are worth preserving.70 After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even fewer people will experience them than have walked through Antarctica's icy landscapes.There's also the emerging off-world economy to consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and 75 beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely been broached-and the relevant legal and regulatory framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are 80 often reluctant to engage with such questions.One speaker at last week's space-mining forum in Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that regulation should be avoided. But miners have much to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit 85 exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek one out
Question: The author of Passage 1 indicates that space mining could have which positive effect?

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the  labyrinthine streets of London might have oncabbies' brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to beinvolved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies-a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The moreyears a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.The brain is a mutable organ, capable-within limits-of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known asneuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structurewas more or less static. Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.After her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with ElizabethValentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the Londoncabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners  and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical 45 differences in the brains of the memory champs, evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural50 difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. What's more, on every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes' scores came back well within the normal range. The 55 memory champs weren't smarter, and they didn't have special brains.But there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the researchers looked at which parts of the 60 brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry. According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be 65 working in overdrive for the mental athletes.Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial70 navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn't seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in 75 their mind's eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating like London cabbies when they're supposed to be remembering the shapes of snowflakes?Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes 80 to describe exactly what was going through their minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said they were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial85 journeys. They weren't doing this automatically, or because it was an inborn talent they'd nurtured since childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural activity that Maguire's fMRIs turned up were the result of training and practice
Question: Which question was Maguire's study of mental athletes primarily intended to answer?
Choices:
  A: Does the act of memorization make use of different brain structures than does the act of navigation?
  B: Do mental athletes inherit their unusual brain structures, or do the structures develop as a result of specific activities?
  C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
  D: What is the relationship between general cognitive ability and the unusual brain structures of mental athletes?
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Explanation: Maguire's study of mental athletes was mainly intended to determine whether the memory champs' unusually high level of memorization ability reflects an abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure. The study aimed to find out if the memory champs' brains were different in structure from that of the rest of the population, or if they were simply making better use of the memory abilities that we all possess. Therefore, the best answer is C.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how Maguire studied mental athletes to determine whether their brains were different structurally or if they were simply making better use of normal memory abilities.
  A: This question is not addressed in the passage.
  B: This question is not the primary focus of Maguire's study of mental athletes.
  C: This question aligns with Maguire's study of mental athletes as it aims to determine if mental athletes have abnormal brain structures or if they simply use normal brain structures to memorize better.
  D: This question is not addressed in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Eleanor Maguire's research on the effect of learning and training on the brain's structure and neural activity.
  The study of London cabbies found differences in the size of the right posterior hippocampus in the brains of cabbies compared to non-cabbies.
  Maguire's study of mental athletes found no significant structural differences in their brains compared to a control group.
  However, the mental athletes appeared to be using different regions of the brain and engaging visual memory and spatial navigation when memorizing information.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Maguire studied the brains of London cabbies and found that their hippocampus was larger than that of non-cabbies.
  Maguire then studied the brains of mental athletes, who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. 
  Maguire and her team wanted to find out whether mentally athletic brains were structurally different from those of others during memory competition or whether they just made better use of memory abilities that everyone possesses. When mentally athletic brains showed up on functional MRIs, several regions of the brain were involved in visual memory and spatial navigation. 
  The mental athletes' brain structure was indistinguishable from that of the control subjects; however, during memorization, the mental athletes were using entirely different brain circuitry than the control group.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, what potential criticism might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model?
Choices:
  A: Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.
  B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  C: Volkov's direct application of an electrical current would have been objectionable to Hodick and Sievers.
  D: Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the mechanism by which Venus flytraps identify prey.
  Volkov and colleagues demonstrated that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close.
  The concentration of calcium ions is important for the trap to close.
  The trap needs a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions to close.
  Touching a trigger hair causes an electric action potential and induces calcium channels to open in the trap. This process is similar to processes that occur during communication between human neurons.
Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes a model proposed by Hodick and Sievers that explains how Venus flytraps encode and store information about potential prey.
  The model suggests that the Venus flytrap encodes this information in the electric charge of its leaf and that the concentration of calcium ions plays a central role in the process.
  Volkov and colleagues at Oakwood University were able to demonstrate the central role of electricity in the Venus flytrap closing through experimentation.
  The passage does not suggest that there was any disagreement or conflict between Hodick and Sievers and Volkov about the scientific principles involved in their respective experiments.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  1. Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the Venus flytrap stored information in the electric charge of its leaf regarding how many trigger hairs had been touched. 
  2. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama demonstrated that electricity caused the Venus flytrap to close.
  3. Volkov modified the experiment to determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
  A: There is no information in the passage that suggests that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect. 
  B: The passage indicates that Volkov's measurements supported Hodick and Sievers's model. Specifically, it states, "Subsequent research supports this model". 
  C: The passage gives no indication of whether Hodick and Sievers objected to Volkov's direct application of an electrical current. 
  D: There is no information in the passage that suggests that the technology used by Volkov and his colleagues was not available to Hodick and Sievers. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Hodick and Sievers's model proposes that the Venus flytrap stores information about the number of hairs that have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  Volkov and his colleagues demonstrated that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close, and they used electrodes to apply an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap.
  The amount of electrical current needed for the trap to close was determined to be as low as 14 microcoulombs within 20 seconds.
  
Analysis:
  The question asks about a potential criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model. While the passage describes Volkov's experiments and their results, it does not offer any criticism of them. Therefore, option A and option C are incorrect. The passage describes how Volkov's experiments were used to corroborate Hodick and Sievers's model, so it is unlikely that option B is correct. Option D is implausible because the passage doesn't offer any reason to believe that the technology used by Volkov was not available to Hodick and Sievers.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the work of scientists studying the mechanism by which Venus flytraps close their traps around prey, focusing on the role of electric charge and calcium ions in the process. 
  The scientists Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers proposed that the flytrap stores information about how many trigger hairs have been touched in the electric charge and calcium ion concentration of its leaf.
  Alexander Volkov and his colleagues tested this model and demonstrated that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close, though it is not clear whether their results corroborated Hodick and Sievers's proposal about how the flytrap encodes and stores information. 
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a model proposed by Hodick and Sievers that explains how the Venus flytrap encodes, stores, and recalls information.
  The model suggests that the electric charge of the leaf encodes the memory of how many hairs have been touched, and that a high enough concentration of calcium ions is required to close the trap.
  Volkov and his colleagues tested the model by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap and determining the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Based on the passage, the potential criticism that might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model. Although Volkov did demonstrate that electricity caused the Venus flytrap to close, the passage does not mention whether his measurements confirmed the hypothesis that the trap requires a high enough concentration of calcium ions to close.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
The passage describes that Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers, proposed that the Venus flytrap encoded and stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama were able to demonstrate that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap.

A: The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.
B: The passage mentions that Volkov and his colleagues demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close which supports Hodick and Sievers's model. Therefore, this is not a potential criticism of Volkov's testing.
C: The passage does not suggest that Volkov's direct application of an electrical current would have been objectionable to Hodick and Sievers. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.
D: The passage does not suggest that Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Volkov and his colleagues demonstrated that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close.
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that the Venus flytrap stores information about the number of trigger hairs touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  According to Hodick and Sievers's model, the Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close, and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. 
  A second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  Volkov and his team modified an experiment and determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
Action: Answer("B") 
Based on the passage, Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model, that a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  • The Venus flytrap stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  • Touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap that increases concentration of calcium ions.
  • A second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.
  • Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close.
  • Volkov's experiment showed that as long as 14 microcoulombs flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed.
Action: Answer("B")  
Based on the passage, a potential criticism that might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model. Although Volkov's experiment showed that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close and provided a quantitative measurement of how much electrical charge is needed for the trap to close, there is no direct evidence from his experiment that calcium channels are involved, which is an important element of Hodick and Sievers’s model. Therefore, Volkov's measurements do not fully support Hodick and Sievers’ model.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes experiments done to understand how the Venus flytrap processes information from insect visits.
  Hodick and Siever's model proposes that the trap stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched, and that this information is encoded in the electric charge of the leaf.
  Volkov demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close.
  Volkov determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close by rigging up very fine electrodes and applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Based on the passage, a potential criticism that might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.

Topic: English
Context: Voters need to understand the prosaic details of.complex policies. Most have staked out positions on.these issues, but they are not often reasoned.positions, which take hard intellectual work. Most.citizens opt instead for simplistic explanations,.assuming wrongly that they comprehend the nuances.of issues..Psychological scientists have a name for this.easy, automatic, simplistic thinking: the illusion of.explanatory depth. We strongly believe that we.understand complex matters, when in fact we are.clueless, and these false and extreme beliefs.shape our preferences, judgments, and actions—.including our votes..Is it possible to shake such deep-rooted.convictions? That’s the question that Philip.Fernbach, a psychological scientist at the University.of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business, wanted to.explore. Fernbach and his colleagues wondered if.forcing people to explain complex policies in.detail—not cheerleading for a position but really.considering the mechanics of implementation—.might force them to confront their ignorance and.thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. They.ran a series of lab experiments to test this idea..They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in.their 30s—Democrats, Republicans, and.Independents—and asking them to state their.positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat.tax to a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions..The volunteers indicated how strongly they felt about.each issue and also rated their own understanding of.the issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to.write elaborate explanations of two issues. If the issue.was cap and trade, for example, they would first.explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is.implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could.hurt, the sources of carbon emissions, and so forth..They were not asked for value judgments about the.policy or about the environment or business, but.only for a highly detailed description of the.mechanics of the policy in action..Let’s be honest: Most of us never do this..Fernbach’s idea was that such an exercise would.force many to realize just how little they really know.about cap and trade, and confronted with their own.ignorance, they would dampen their own.enthusiasm. They would be humbled and as a result.take less extreme positions. And that’s just what.happened. Trying—and failing—to explain complex.policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about.being well-informed. They became more moderate in.their views as a result..Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a.policy is not the same as trying to sell that policy..In fact, talking about one’s views can often.strengthen them. Fernbach believes it’s the slow,.cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that.changes people’s judgments, but he wanted to check.this in another experiment. This one was very similar.to the first, but some volunteers, instead of.explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it..The results were clear. Those who simply listed.reasons for their positions—articulating their.values—were less shaken in their views. They.continued to think they understood the policies in.their complexity, and, notably, they remained.extreme in their passion for their positions..Polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are.unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out.information that bolsters their views, often without.knowing it. They also process new information in.biased ways, and they hang out with people like.themselves. All of these psychological forces increase.political extremism, and no simple measure will.change that. But forcing the candidates to provide.concrete and elaborate plans might be a start; it gives.citizens a starting place.

Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: Which statement best describes the relationship between the two passages?
Choices:
  A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
  B: Passage 2 explains the scientific question addressed by the central hypothesis developed in Passage 1.
  C: Passage 2 discusses possible implications of the central hypothesis summarized in Passage 1.
  D: Passage 2 identifies evidence in favor of the central hypothesis advanced in Passage 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 summarizes a hypothesis related to an extraterrestrial impact that caused a cooling period and significant changes in life in North America. 
  Passage 2 provides a critique of the central hypothesis proposed in Passage 1, arguing that the supporting evidence is not as strong as has been suggested.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 summarizes a hypothesis that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap approximately 13,000 years ago, and that this event caused temperatures to plunge across the North American continent and contributed to the extinction of several species, including the Clovis hunters and the large prehistoric animals. The hypothesis is supported by geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America.
  Passage 2 describes evidence counter to some of the claims made in support of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1. Specifically, the paper that forms the basis of Passage 2 examines the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which proponents of the impact hypothesis have reported evidence for a cosmic collision. While some of these sites include Clovis points, only three of the 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, approximately 12,800 years ago.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a hypothesis where a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, causing temperatures to plunge for the next millennium resulting in the cooling of the climate and the disappearance of the Clovis hunters and the continent’s large mammals. Evidence from geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America are presented to support this hypothesis. 
  Passage 2 discusses a rebuttal of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis that proponents of this hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element iridium, microscopic diamonds, and magnetic particles at sites supposedly dated to about 12,800 years ago. The paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas, examines the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision and argues that the Younger Dryas impact fails on both theoretical and empirical grounds.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes a team of scientists presenting a hypothesis that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago. The hypothesis explains the extinction of large mammals, the disappearance of Clovis hunters, and the Younger Dryas cooling period in North America.
  Passage 2 discusses the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis and some claims made by its proponents and challenges to those claims made by other specialists. The passage presents a study that looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision. The team argues that when the quality and accuracy of the dating is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.

Topic: English
Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden  with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are 5 the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the10 procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those15 doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty20 years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that25 makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively30 no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us35 then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old40 family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so 45 long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The0 questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that55 procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will60 object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men65 have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our70 brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the75 gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this "civilization" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in80 them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Another man might have thrown up his.hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters.acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with.Line satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of.a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course.knew that he must proliferate his sources of.revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni.for tending the tube wells would not even begin to.suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off.a condemned electric motor—condemned by him..He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at.the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken.radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not.demur even when asked to fix watches, though that.enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned.him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took.apart ever kept time again..K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived.mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,.Nawab would place himself night and day at the door.leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled.grove of ancient banyan trees where the old.farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator.glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the.household machinery, the air conditioners, water.heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an.engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer.in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he.almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the.same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and.lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in.Lahore..Harouni of course became familiar with this.ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on.his tours of inspection, but morning and night could.be found standing on the master bed rewiring the.light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water.heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the.psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say.a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his.nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him.to go ahead..“Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to.the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube.wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is.but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have.earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to.show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties.as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive.me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud.hunger within than disgrace in the light of day..Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”.The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of.speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at.his nails and waited for the breeze to stop..“What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”.Unauthorized copying or reuse of any part of this page is illegal. **22 CONTINUE**.“Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your.service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,.on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the.many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery.fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a.bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I.first had the good fortune to enter your employment..I beg you, sir, let me go.”.“And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing.that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly.care one way or the other, except that it touched on.his comfort—a matter of great interest to him..“Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could.somehow limp along, at least until I train up some.younger man.”.The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt.expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the.disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a.brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even.managed to extract an allowance for gasoline..The motorcycle increased his status, gave him.weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and.asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he.knew absolutely nothing. He could now range.further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,.now he could spend every night with his wife, who.had begged to live not on the farm but near her.family in Firoza, where also they could educate at.least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road.ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way.to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni.lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new.machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every.knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,.seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial.wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to.whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears.almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his.arrival.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Voters need to understand the prosaic details of.complex policies. Most have staked out positions on.these issues, but they are not often reasoned.positions, which take hard intellectual work. Most.citizens opt instead for simplistic explanations,.assuming wrongly that they comprehend the nuances.of issues..Psychological scientists have a name for this.easy, automatic, simplistic thinking: the illusion of.explanatory depth. We strongly believe that we.understand complex matters, when in fact we are.clueless, and these false and extreme beliefs.shape our preferences, judgments, and actions—.including our votes..Is it possible to shake such deep-rooted.convictions? That’s the question that Philip.Fernbach, a psychological scientist at the University.of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business, wanted to.explore. Fernbach and his colleagues wondered if.forcing people to explain complex policies in.detail—not cheerleading for a position but really.considering the mechanics of implementation—.might force them to confront their ignorance and.thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. They.ran a series of lab experiments to test this idea..They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in.their 30s—Democrats, Republicans, and.Independents—and asking them to state their.positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat.tax to a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions..The volunteers indicated how strongly they felt about.each issue and also rated their own understanding of.the issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to.write elaborate explanations of two issues. If the issue.was cap and trade, for example, they would first.explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is.implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could.hurt, the sources of carbon emissions, and so forth..They were not asked for value judgments about the.policy or about the environment or business, but.only for a highly detailed description of the.mechanics of the policy in action..Let’s be honest: Most of us never do this..Fernbach’s idea was that such an exercise would.force many to realize just how little they really know.about cap and trade, and confronted with their own.ignorance, they would dampen their own.enthusiasm. They would be humbled and as a result.take less extreme positions. And that’s just what.happened. Trying—and failing—to explain complex.policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about.being well-informed. They became more moderate in.their views as a result..Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a.policy is not the same as trying to sell that policy..In fact, talking about one’s views can often.strengthen them. Fernbach believes it’s the slow,.cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that.changes people’s judgments, but he wanted to check.this in another experiment. This one was very similar.to the first, but some volunteers, instead of.explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it..The results were clear. Those who simply listed.reasons for their positions—articulating their.values—were less shaken in their views. They.continued to think they understood the policies in.their complexity, and, notably, they remained.extreme in their passion for their positions..Polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are.unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out.information that bolsters their views, often without.knowing it. They also process new information in.biased ways, and they hang out with people like.themselves. All of these psychological forces increase.political extremism, and no simple measure will.change that. But forcing the candidates to provide.concrete and elaborate plans might be a start; it gives.citizens a starting place.
Question: The passage implies that when conducting his laboratorywork, Fernbach would have been most surprised by which finding?
Choices:
  A: No link was found between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions.
  B: After volunteers were asked to analyze a complicated political issue, their understanding of it did not increase.
  C: When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
  D: When volunteers were asked questions about complex issues, those with the most extreme views were found to have the best overall understanding of them.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes a laboratory experiment conducted by Fernbach and his colleagues to test the idea that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might weaken their extremist stands on issues. Volunteers were asked to explain the mechanics of an issue, not to express value judgments about it. Participants indicated their positions on different issues and rated their own understanding of them before and after the experiment.
A: The passage does not mention any study findings related to a link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions. The passage suggests that Fernbach was focused on exploring whether or not volunteers' positions might be weakened by making them explain the mechanics of policy implementation.
B: The passage suggests that Fernbach's hypothesis was supported by the lab experiment results: trying to explain detailed mechanics of complex policies undermined the volunteers' illusions of being well-informed, and as a result, they became more moderate in their views. Therefore, it is unlikely that Fernbach would have been most surprised by the finding in option B.
C: This answer choice correctly summarizes one of the study's findings that Fernbach would have been particularly interested in. The passage suggests that volunteers who merely listed reasons for their positions remained extreme in their passion for their views, continued to think they understood the policies in their complexity, and were less shaken in their views overall. This finding is in contrast to those who were instructed to write elaborate explanations of two issues, which undermined their extremist beliefs and contributed to them becoming more moderate in their views.
D: The passage does not mention any study findings supporting this answer choice. In fact, the passage suggests that the opposite might be true: Psychological scientists have a name for easy, automatic, simplistic thinking: the illusion of explanatory depth. Volunteers are often clueless about complex issues, and these false beliefs shape their preferences, judgments, and actions, including their votes.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues, which aimed to see whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues. 
  The volunteers were asked to state their positions on a variety of issues, and to rate their own understanding of the issues. Then they were asked to write elaborate explanations of two issues. They were not asked for value judgments about the policy, only for a highly detailed description of the mechanics of the policy in action. 
  The study found that trying (and failing) to explain complex policies undermined the extremists' illusions about being well-informed. They became more moderate in their views as a result. Those who simply listed reasons for their positions—articulating their values—were less shaken in their views. They continued to think they understood the policies in their complexity, and they remained extreme in their passion for their positions.

Analysis: 
  The question asks which finding would have surprised Fernbach the most during his laboratory work. Option A is not correct because the passage does not discuss a link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions. Option B is incorrect because the study did not aim to increase the volunteers' understanding of issues; it aimed to confront their ignorance of their own understanding and weaken their extremist stands on issues. Option D is also not correct because the passage does not suggest that volunteers with extreme views had a better overall understanding of complex issues. This leaves us with Option C.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses an experiment conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues to test whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might weaken their extremist stands on issues. 
  A: The passage does not discuss the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions, so this is not the finding Fernbach would have been most surprised by.
  B: The passage indicates that Fernbach believed that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might expose their ignorance and therefore make them more moderate in their views. The passage states that this is in fact what happened: "Trying—and failing—to explain complex policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about being well-informed. They became more moderate in their views as a result." Therefore, it is unlikely that Fernbach would have been surprised to find that the volunteers' understanding of the issue did not increase after analyzing it.
  C: The passage discusses an experiment where volunteers were instructed to list reasons for their positions and found that doing so did not weaken their views. This implies that Fernbach would not be surprised to find that listing reasons for endorsing a particular policy did not significantly affect volunteers' views.
  D: The passage does not mention any correlation between volunteers' understanding of complex issues and the extremeness of their views. Therefore, this is not the finding Fernbach would have been most surprised by.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses experiments conducted by Fernbach to test whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might weaken their extremist stands on issues. 
  The experiments involved recruiting volunteers to state their positions on various issues, rate their understanding of the issues, and then explain the mechanics of how specific policies work. 
  The volunteers were not asked for value judgments about the policy or about the environment or business, but only for a highly detailed description of the mechanics of the policy in action.
  The results of the experiments showed that trying—and failing—to explain complex policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about being well-informed, and they became more moderate in their views as a result. 
  Those who simply listed reasons for their positions—articulating their values—were less shaken in their views. They continued to think they understood the policies in their complexity, and, notably, they remained extreme in their passion for their positions.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about Philip Fernbach's research.
  Fernbach believed that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail, might force them to confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The volunteers were recruited and asked to state their positions on a variety of issues and rate their own understanding of the issues.
  Then, they were instructed to write elaborate explanations of two issues.
  Some volunteers, instead of explaining a policy, only listed reasons for liking it.
  The ones who listed reasons for their positions were less shaken in their views and remained extreme in their passion for their positions.
  On the other hand, the ones who were forced to explain complex policies became more moderate in their views as a result.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes an experiment conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues to determine if asking people to explain complex policies in detail would cause them to confront their own ignorance and weaken their extreme views on the issues. 
  A: The passage does not provide information on whether or not a link was found between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions. The passage focuses on the impact of asking volunteers to explain complex policies in detail, not the complexity of the policies themselves.
  B: The passage states that volunteers were asked to explain complex policies in detail and their views became more moderate as a result. Therefore, the implication is that their understanding of the issue did increase.
  C: The passage states that the volunteers who were asked to list reasons for their positions were less shaken in their views, implying that their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
  D: The passage does not provide information on whether or not those with the most extreme views were found to have the best overall understanding of complex issues. The experiment focused on the impact of asking volunteers to explain complex policies in detail, not the relationship between extreme views and understanding of complex issues.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes a series of lab experiments conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues to test whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might weaken their extremist stands on issues. 
  Volunteers in their 30s were recruited and asked to state their positions on a variety of issues, then instructed to write elaborate explanations of two issues to examine the impact on their views.
  The experiment aimed to test whether forcing the volunteers to describe the mechanics of the policy in action rather than their value judgments about the policy or other factors that might influence their decision-making would dampen their enthusiasm and make them more moderate in their views.
Action: Answer("C") 
The passage describes an experiment in which volunteers, instead of explaining a policy, were merely asked to list their reasons for liking it. The results of this experiment showed that these volunteers were less shaken in their views and continued to think they understood the policies in their complexity, remaining extreme in their passion for their positions. Therefore, the passage implies that Fernbach would have been most surprised by the finding presented in choice C, which indicates that when volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses laboratory experiments conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues to explore the idea that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues. The experiments involve recruiting volunteers to state their positions on a variety of issues, rating their own understanding of the issues, and then instructing them to write elaborate explanations of two issues in order to make them realize how little they really know about the issues. The volunteers become more moderate in their views as a result.
  
  A: The passage does not indicate whether the complexity of an issue was linked to the strength of the volunteers’ positions. The passage instead suggests that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail can force them to confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues, regardless of the complexity of the issue itself.
  
  B: The passage does not indicate that the understanding of volunteers did not increase after they were asked to analyze a complicated political issue. The passage suggests the opposite; after being forced to explain complex policies in detail, volunteers became more moderate in their views as a result.
  
  C: The passage suggests that when volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise. Fernbach found that simply listing reasons for their positions was less effective at shaking the illusions of explanatory depth and ignorance than the process of trying—and failing—to explain complex policies by describing the mechanics of the policy in action.
  
  D: The passage does not indicate that those with the most extreme views had the best overall understanding of complex issues. The passage suggests the opposite; being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a policy is what can change people's judgments and lead them to realize just how little they really know about the policy, dampening their enthusiasm and making them more moderate in their views.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes an experiment conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues at the University of Colorado, which aimed to investigate the effect of forcing people to explain complex policies in detail on their extremist stands on those issues. 
  A: The passage does not discuss the relationship between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions, so this is not the answer.
  B: The passage mentions that the volunteers were asked to write elaborate explanations of two complex issues and explains the mechanics of implementation without being asked for value judgments about the policy. It also implies that many of the volunteers realized how little they really knew about the issues, and their illusions about being well-informed were undermined, which made them more moderate in their views. So, this is also not the answer.
  C: The passage details how the volunteers' views were affected when they were asked to list reasons for their positions. It reports that those who simply listed reasons for their positions were less shaken in their views. They continued to think they understood the policies in their complexity, and notably, they remained extreme in their passion for their positions. Therefore, this option is the answer.
  D: The passage does not mention anything about the relationship between the extremism of the volunteers' views and their understanding of complex issues. So, this is not the answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the work of psychological scientist Philip Fernbach, who investigated whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues. Fernbach's experiments involved recruiting volunteers and asking them to state their positions on various political issues, then instructing them to write elaborate explanations of two of those issues. One group of volunteers listed reasons for their positions, while the other group was asked to provide highly detailed descriptions of the mechanics of the policy in action. The results showed that those who provided detailed explanations of policy were humbled by their lack of knowledge and became more moderate in their views, while those who merely listed reasons for their positions were less shaken in their views and remained extreme in their passion for their positions.
  
A: The passage does not mention a link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions, so it cannot be the answer.
B: The passage does not mention that volunteers' understanding of a complex political issue did not increase after they analyzed it. In fact, the passage suggests that analyzing policy in detail humbled the volunteers and made them more moderate in their views, so this cannot be the answer.
C: The excerpt specifically states that those who merely listed reasons for their positions were less shaken in their views and remained extreme in their passion for their positions. This finding supports Fernbach's overall hypothesis that forcing people to articulate the nuts and bolts of a policy is different from trying to sell that policy, and that it is the slow, cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that changes people's judgments. Therefore, this choice is the answer.
D: The passage does not mention that those with the most extreme views had the best overall understanding of complex issues, so it cannot be the answer.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage describes Little Chandler's thoughts and emotions as he contemplates his past and present life, including his friend Ignatius Gallaher's success in London. 

A: Little Chandler fixates on Gallaher's success and the social world of London, but there is no indication in the passage that he believes it to be a hollow spectacle.
B: Little Chandler does not immerse himself in sights and sounds that he finds ultimately frivolous. He does find joy in a present moment, despite his melancholy thoughts.
C: There is no indication that Little Chandler scorns a historical era that he concedes is preferable to the present.
D: Little Chandler does derive excitement from placing himself in settings that he finds menacing. There is a sense of fear and apprehension in his walks through the dark and narrow streets at night.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Little Chandler is a character from the story "A Little Cloud" by James Joyce.
  The passage describes Little Chandler's thoughts and feelings as he leaves work and walks towards a meeting with his friend Gallaher.
  Throughout the passage there is a sense that Little Chandler is discontented with his life and envies Gallaher's success.
  The passage also suggests that Little Chandler is romantic and imaginative, but insecure and indecisive. 
  A: The passage does describe Little Chandler as having conflicting feelings about the social world he fixates on. On the one hand, he is excited about the prospect of meeting his worldly friend Gallaher, and he is fascinated by wealthy and fashionable people he sees on the street. On the other hand, he is aware that this world is largely superficial and unfulfilling, and he feels sad that he himself is trapped in a routine and mundane existence. However, this doesn't quite capture the sense of contradiction in his character, as both his attraction to and disillusionment with the social world are consistent with his broader characterization.
  B: The passage describes many frivolous sights and sounds that Little Chandler is drawn to, including children playing, nurses and old men sleeping, and fashionably dressed people getting out of taxis. However, Little Chandler doesn't seem to have an inherent disdain for these things, and is more ambivalent than genuinely dismissive about the value of the pleasures he glimpses. 
  C: There is no indication in the passage that Little Chandler scorns a historical era.
  D: This choice comes closest to capturing the sense of contradiction in Little Chandler's character. While he is generally cautious and anxious in his thoughts and actions, he also has a perverse desire to expose himself to situations that scare or unsettle him. He describes seeking out narrow and dark streets late at night, and feeling excited and apprehensive about the risks he is taking. This impulse seems to run counter to his generally meek and tentative personality.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Little Chandler as a man of refined manners and somewhat delicate disposition who becomes melancholic when thinking about the struggles of life. He daydreams about his friend Gallaher who has become successful in London, and looks for joy in going out to eat at a fancy place in Dublin. He is also easily frightened by the grimy children and the silent figures of the city at night.
Option A: This choice describes Little Chandler's disillusionment with the glamorous social world of theater-goers and oyster-eaters that he glances at but never enters. This does not represent a contradictory impulse in his character.
Option B: This choice describes Little Chandler's appreciation for the beauty of his surroundings, even when he is sad. Since he does not view the sights and sounds he immerses himself in as frivolous, this option does not represent a contradictory impulse in his character.
Option C: This choice describes no mentioned struggles in Little Chandler's attitudes or impulses.
Option D: This choice describes the contradictory impulse of Little Chandler's excitement at placing himself in settings that frighten him.
Action: Answer("D")

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: A pair of recent studies suggests that although.industrialized nations may have benefitted from larger.cities, the same is not true for the rapidly urbanizing areas of.the developing world. In these parts of the globe, there really.might be such a thing as too much urbanization, too.quickly..The studies, by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez-.Pose of the London School of Economics, take a close look.at the actual connection between city size and nationwide.economic performance. Their initial study, from last year,.examines the relationship between economic development,.as measured by GDP per capita, and average metropolitan-.area size in 114 countries across the world between 1960.and 2010. To ensure robustness, it controls for variables.including national population size, physical land area,.education levels, economic openness, and other factors..The size of cities or metro areas across the world has.exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the.developing world growing much faster and much larger.than those in more developed nations. Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew.modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median.city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding.from 220,000 to 845,000 people. In 1960, 12 of the top 20.countries with the largest average city size were high-.income countries; by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the.developing world..Urbanization has historically been thought of as a.necessary feature of economic development and growth, but.this study finds the connection is not so simple. While.advanced nations benefit from having larger cities,.developing nations do not. Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every.additional 100,000 in average population among its large.cities over a five-year period.

Question: It can most reasonably be inferred from the passagethat a megacity’s economic impact on a country is
Choices:
  A: greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
  B: dependent on the types of companies located in the megacity.
  C: relatively equal for developing countries and high-income countries.
  D: neutralized by the economic cost of maintaining a megacity.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that having a metro area with more than 10 million inhabitants only produces a nationwide economic benefit if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more (this is in reference to larger countries with more developed economies).
  The passage also states that developing nations tend to get a bigger economic benefit from smaller and medium-size cities, and that advanced nations benefit from having larger cities.
  There is no mention in the passage of the economic cost of maintaining a megacity.
Action: Answer("B")

Knowledge: 
  The researchers found that developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck from smaller and medium-size cities. These countries see the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people or less. Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more, according to the study. Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play host to knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The economic impact of a megacity on a country is discussed in the passage.
  Megacities are typically defined as cities with populations of over ten million people.
  The study found that having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more.
  Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries that are more developed and are more likely to have knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The researchers found that larger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries. 
  Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more.
  Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play host to knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies.
  Megacities often fail to spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world.
  The connection between large cities and growth has now become much more tenuous, producing a new pattern of “urbanization without growth.”
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that "Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more." This means that larger countries tend to benefit more from megacities because they have a larger urban population.
A: The passage does not suggest that a megacity's economic impact is greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
B: The passage suggests that a megacity's economic impact is dependent on the total urban population, as explained above. While the types of companies located in the megacity may play a role, the passage does not directly address this.
C: The passage explicitly states that "While advanced nations benefit from having larger cities, developing nations do not." It also states that the economic impact of increasing the population by 100,000 people in a large city is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year period in developing countries, but a 0.7 percent increase in advanced countries.
D: The passage does not suggest that the economic impact of megacities is neutralized by the cost of maintaining them. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the relationship between city size and nationwide economic performance in 114 countries across the world between 1960 and 2010, and how the studies found that although advanced nations benefit from having larger cities, developing nations do not. Additionally, the article states that having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more.
A: The article does not make any connection between the physical land area of a country and a megacity's economic impact. Therefore, A is not a reasonable inference.
B: The article states that advanced nations are more likely to host knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies. However, the article does not provide information about what types of companies are located in megacities, thus making B an unreasonable inference.
C: The article states that advanced nations benefit from having larger cities while developing nations do not. Therefore, it would be an unreasonable inference to conclude that a megacity's economic impact is relatively equal for both developing and high-income countries.
D: The article does not state that the economic cost of maintaining a megacity neutralizes its economic impact. Therefore, it would be an unreasonable inference to conclude that D is the most reasonable answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  According to the passage, a megacity is a city with a population of over ten million people.
  Advanced nations benefit from having larger cities, while developing nations do not.
  Advanced nations experience a 0.7% increase in economic growth for every additional 100,000 in average population among its large cities over a five-year period.
  However, for developing nations, the addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3% decrease in economic growth over a five-year period.
  Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more.
  This makes sense: bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play host to knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The article highlights the findings of two studies that examine the relationship between city size and nationwide economic performance. The first study finds that developing nations do not benefit from larger cities as much as advanced nations. The second study finds that developing nations tend to get a bigger benefit from smaller and medium-size cities.
  A: The article does not mention physical land areas as a factor that affects a megacity's economic impact on a country.
  B: The article suggests that the connection between megacities and growth has become more tenuous due to the globally interconnected economy, and that megacities often fail to spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world. The article does not suggest that the location of companies in a megacity is the primary determinant of the megacity's economic impact on a country.
  C: The article suggests that developing nations do not benefit from larger cities as much as advanced nations. Therefore, it cannot be reasonably inferred that the economic impact of a megacity on a developing country is relatively equal to that on a high-income country.
  D: The article does not mention that the economic cost of maintaining a megacity neutralizes its economic impact on a country. Moreover, the article suggests that larger cities tend to have a negative economic impact on developing nations. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the connection between city size and economic growth, specifically in the context of developing nations. It notes that while larger cities tend to benefit advanced nations, they are not necessarily beneficial for developing nations and may even have a negative impact. The article also mentions that larger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries.
A: The article does not suggest that a megacity's economic impact is greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
B: The article notes that the economic impact of larger cities depends on the types of companies located there, but this is not the main point being made in relation to megacities.
C: The article does not suggest that the economic impact of megacities is relatively equal for developing countries and high-income countries, but rather that larger cities tend to benefit advanced nations more than developing nations.
D: The article does not suggest that the economic cost of maintaining a megacity neutralizes its economic impact.
Action: Answer("B") 
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  A: The passage does not discuss a relationship between a country's physical land area and the economic impact of megacities on that country.
  B: The passage suggests that the economic impact of a megacity on a country is dependent on the size of the country and the proportion of the country's population living in cities of varying sizes, rather than the types of companies located in a megacity.
  C: The passage indicates that while advanced nations benefit from having larger cities, developing nations do not. Adding 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a decrease in economic growth over a five-year period in developing nations, but it is associated with an increase in economic growth over a five-year period in advanced nations.
  D: The passage does not suggest that the economic impact of a megacity on a country is neutralized by the economic cost of maintaining a megacity.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

Question: An unstated assumption made by the authors about clover is that the plants
Choices:
  A: do not produce pyrethrums.
  B: are members of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  C: are usually located near wild-type honeybee colonies.
  D: will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The article mentions that honeybees are fed on mono-crops, which are likely nutritionally deficient, and may be deficient in anti-mite toxins such as pyrethrums and other nutrients.
  Pyrethrums are potent insecticides with anti-mite activity that are produced by plants in the Chrysanthemum genus.
  The article suggests that the proper dosage of pyrethrums necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum-containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the amount already consumed by the bees.
  The article proposes a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum-producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental colonies versus control colonies. 

Assumption: The authors do not state that clover does not produce pyrethrums or that it is a member of the Chrysanthemum genus. The article does state that clover is a typical bee food source, which implies that it does not produce pyrethrums. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The authors discuss pyrethrums in relation to their anti-mite properties.
  The authors mention clover as a typical food source for bees, but they do not mention it having any anti-mite properties.
  Based on the context, there is no reason to assume that clover is a member of the Chrysanthemum genus or that it is usually located near wild-type honeybee colonies.
Action: Answer("A") 
The unstated assumption made by the authors about clover is that the plants do not produce pyrethrums.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The authors hypothesize that the honeybees of commercial bee colonies are deficient in anti-mite toxins, such as pyrethrums, because they are not feeding on pyrethrum producing plants.
  The authors suggest a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum producing plants as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only clover.
  The authors do not provide any evidence or suggestion that clover is a poor food source for honeybees.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses pyrethrums, which are insecticides produced by a group of flowering plants that includes Chrysanthemum species. Pyrethrums have anti-mite activity and may be a natural defense against Varroa mite infestations in honeybee colonies. The authors propose a trial in which commercial honeybee colonies are offered pyrethrum-producing plants and a typical bee food source, such as clover, to test the hypothesis that nutritionally deficient bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations. The authors note that the bees may seek out or avoid pyrethrum-containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the amount already consumed. 
Assumption: 
  The authors do not state whether clover produces pyrethrums, but they do state that the control colonies will be offered only clover as a typical bee food source.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The article mentions that "We suspect that the bees of commercial bee colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees." and that "controls are offered only the clover" during the experiment.
  
  A: The article does not state whether clover produces pyrethrums or not. Also, the experiment involves feeding the bees only clover.
  B: The article mentions that "Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity" but there is no mention of clover being a member of this genus.
  C: The article does not mention any connection between clover and wild-type honeybee colonies.
  D: The article does not state that clover will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies. In fact, clover is mentioned as a "typical bee food source" and is fed to the control colonies.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  In the given context, the authors compare the benefits of pyrethrums with clover as a food source for honeybees.
  The authors suggest that the diet of bees deficient in anti-mite toxins and other essential nutrients may only be clover, which can make the bees susceptible to mite infestations.
  There is no mention in the context to indicate that clover produces pyrethrums or is a member of the Chrysanthemum genus. It, however, indicates that clover is a typical bee food source.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage mentions that pyrethrums are found in plants such as Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium, and Chrysanthemum marschalli.
  The authors of the passage are testing the hypothesis that commercial bee colonies are nutritionally deficient and lack anti-mite toxins such as pyrethrums, and suggest testing the effect of pyrethrum-containing plants on bee colonies' ability to defend against mites.
  The authors propose offering typical bee food source (such as clover) to the control group of bees.
  The passage does not provide any information that would suggest that clover either produces or lacks pyrethrums.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The text mentions that pyrethrums are produced by a group of plants which include Chrysanthemum species, and that the plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The text postulates that commercially reared bees may be deficient in anti-mite toxins, like pyrethrums, and may be susceptible to mite infestations and secondary infections due to nutritionally deficient diet. The trial proposed in the text suggests that a small number of colonies should be tested, and some should be given pyrethrum-producing plants as well as clover, while controls are given only clover. Clover is mentioned as a typical bee food source. 
Action: Answer("A")   
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage mentions that pyrethrums are produced by a group of flowers which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species.
  The authors postulate that bee colonies may be nutritionally deficient, and suggest that a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins like pyrethrums could be contributing to the problem.
  They suggest that a trial be conducted with a small number of bee colonies, offering them pyrethrum-producing plants in addition to a typical bee food source like clover.
  
  A: The passage does not state anything about whether clover plants produce pyrethrums or not. It only suggests that pyrethrums are produced by a group of other flowers.
  B: The passage specifically mentions that Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species produce pyrethrums. It does not mention clover being a member of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  C: The passage does not state anything about the location of clover in relation to wild-type honeybee colonies.
  D: The passage does not make any assumptions or suggestions about the quality of clover as a food source for honeybees in the control colonies. It only suggests that the bees in the experimental group be offered both clover and pyrethrum-producing plants.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.
Question: done") The narrator indicates that he pays Sempere

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What can reasonably be inferred about the reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study?
Choices:
  A: The ibises were well acquainted with their migration route.
  B: Usherwood knew the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration.
  C: The ibises have a body design that is similar to that of a modern airplane.
  D: The ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Usherwood used northern bald ibises for the study.
  A: The text only implies that they were able to show these birds their ancestral migration route, not that they were well-acquainted with it.
  B: There is no evidence in the text to support this statement.
  C: Usherwood compares these big V formation birds to airplanes with wings that go up and down. However, this does not imply that the ibises have a body design that is similar to that of a modern airplane.
  D: The text implies that the ibises were accessible enough for Usherwood and his team to carry out the study.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a study on ibises to investigate why birds fly in a V formation. 
  The study took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.
  Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy.
  The ibises were fitted with data loggers that recorded flight data.
Action: Answer("B") 
Based on the given information, we can reasonably infer that Usherwood knew that northern bald ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration, as the article mentions that "A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab."
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The study used northern bald ibises to understand how birds fly in a "V" formation.
  The study involved reintroducing these ibises to their ancestral migration route.
  The ibises carried data loggers that recorded their flight position and timing of the wing flaps.
  The researchers used a microlight plane to guide the birds and track their flight.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The study took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises to Europe.
  Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy.
  A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
  Scientists did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The study aimed to investigate the reason for the V formation of birds during migration.
  The study used northern bald ibises as the subjects of the study because they were part of an existing project to reintroduce them to Europe.
  The study used data loggers to monitor the flight position and wing flaps of the birds.
  The findings of the study indicated that the ibises positioned themselves accordingly to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: From the passage, it can be inferred that Usherwood and his lab used data loggers to monitor the flight position and timings of the ibises' wing flaps. The passage states that these data loggers were built especially by Usherwood and his lab. This suggests that Usherwood knew that the ibises were able to carry the data loggers during their migration. Thus, the most reasonable inference is that Usherwood knew the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The study by Usherwood and his team used northern bald ibises to investigate the V formation, and found that these birds position their wingtips and sync their flapping to catch the updraft of the preceding bird, which presumably saves energy during flight. 
  The ibises were used in the study because a project to reintroduce them to Europe provided the researchers with an opportunity to study the birds' migration route with a microlight plane, and the birds were hand-raised and thus comfortable with human contact.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
Based on the passage, it can be inferred that the reason Usherwood used the northern bald ibises as subjects in his study was because they were hand-raised and thus relatively easy to work with and track. The passage states that the researchers took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce the endangered birds to Europe, and used a microlight plane to show the birds their ancestral migration route. The flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab, suggesting that the researchers were able to work closely with the birds to gather data about their flight. Therefore, we can reasonably infer that the ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The study used northern bald ibises as subjects.
  The scientists used a microlight plane to show the ibises their migration route and tracked their flight using data loggers.
  The ibises positioned themselves in a V formation and synchronized their wing flapping in order to save energy during flight.
  The researchers did not calculate the bird's energy savings as it would be too invasive for an endangered species.
  
Action: Answer("A") 
  Inference: The study used northern bald ibises as subjects because they were well acquainted with their migration route from Austria to Italy, as the study used a microlight plane to show them the route.
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The article describes that scientists used Northern bald ibises in a study to determine how migrating birds fly in a V formation and potentially save energy.
  A: The text does not indicate explicitly that the ibises were well acquainted with their migration route.
  B: The text does not state that Usherwood chose the ibises because they were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration.
  C: The text mentions that ibises position themselves in a V formation to catch uplifting eddies during migration possibly to save energy. But, it does not suggest that the ibises were chosen because of their body design similarities to modern airplanes.
  D: The text suggests that the scientists used ibises because of their pliability and because of the method established to track them. The scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy and carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The study used northern bald ibises to understand why birds fly in a V-shaped formation.
  The ibises were hand-raised as part of a project to reintroduce them to Europe.
  The ibises were fitted with data loggers to track their flight position and wing flapping timing.
  The study found that the ibises positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front to catch the uplifting eddies.
Action: Answer("B")  
Reasoning: The reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study is explicitly stated in the text. The ibises were part of an existing project to reintroduce them to Europe and had been hand-raised. They were fitted with data loggers to track their flight position and wing flapping timing. Therefore, we can infer that Usherwood knew that the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration. Option B is the correct answer.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The study aimed to investigate the reasons behind why birds fly in a V formation.
  The researchers used northern bald ibises as subjects of their study.
  The ibises were part of an existing project to reintroduce endangered birds back to Europe.
  The researchers used GPS and accelerometers to track the birds' positions and wing flaps.
  The researchers found that the ibises positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front to catch the uplifting eddies.
Action: Answer("B")  
Reasoning: 
  Even though it is not explicitly stated in the passage, we can reasonably infer that Usherwood knew that the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration from the passage's statement, "A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab." This means that Usherwood and his team knew that the ibises were capable of handling the measurement devices and collect useful data during the experiment.

Topic: English
Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

C: The table shows that 83 percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by viruses, but it does not provide information on whether they were infected by all four pathogens.
D: The table does not show that 100 percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The table shows the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together.
  The pathogens are: viruses (including IAPV and KBV), fungi (including Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae).
  The table includes data for colonies with colony collapse disorder and for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  We need to find the percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens.
  
Action: Answer("All four pathogens") 

Explanation: 
If we look at the last row of the table, we can see that the honey bees in all colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens: Nosema ceranae, Nosema apis, viruses (including IAPV and KBV), and fungi. Therefore, the answer is "All four pathogens".
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
The table describes the occurrence of pathogen infection in honeybee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder. 
The table mentions four different pathogens: viruses, IAPV, KBV, and fungi. 
Each row of the table describes a different pathogen and its occurrence in the colonies.
The last row (bottom row) of the table mentions two different types of Nosema.
The last column of the table shows the percentage of colonies without colony collapse disorder that were affected by each pathogen.
The second column of the table shows the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were affected by each pathogen. 

Action: Answer("B")  
According to the table, "Nosema ceranae" was the only pathogen that had 100% occurrence in colonies with colony collapse disorder. Therefore, the answer is NOT given in the table. However, based on the available data, we can say that the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens together is likely less than or equal to 77 percent. Therefore, the most likely answer is B: 77 percent.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The table shows the percent of colonies affected by each pathogen for colonies with and without colony collapse disorder. 
  The question is asking specifically about the percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens. 

Action: Answer("B") 
According to the table, colonies with colony collapse disorder had honeybees infected by all four pathogens, which is shown under the Nosema ceranae pathogen category. Therefore, the answer is 77 percent.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
The table shows the percent of honey bee colonies affected by various pathogens in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder. Each row shows the pathogen and each column shows whether the colony has CCD or not, and the percentage of the affected colonies is shown in the corresponding cell.

Action: Answer("B") 
According to the table, Nosema ceranae was found in all colonies with CCD, therefore, the answer is 77 percent. None of the other options are correct.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The table shows, for colonies with and without colony collapse disorder, the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together.

This I do not find in those who.take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they.are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather.believe it. It would put them below the common level.of human understanding. But when the leaders.choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of.popularity, their talents, in the construction of the.state, will be of no service. They will become.flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not.the guides, of the people. If any of them should.happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly.limited and defined with proper qualifications, he.will be immediately outbid by his competitors who.will produce something more splendidly popular..Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause..Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of.cowards, and compromise as the prudence of.traitors, until, in hopes of preserving the credit which.may enable him to temper and moderate, on some.occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become.active in propagating doctrines and establishing.powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose.at which he ultimately might have aimed..But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all.that deserves commendation in the indefatigable.labors of this Assembly? I do not deny that, among.an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some.good may have been done. They who destroy.everything certainly will remove some grievance..They who make everything new have a chance that.they may establish something beneficial. To give.them credit for what they have done in virtue of the.authority they have usurped, or which can excuse.them in the crimes by which that authority has been.acquired, it must appear that the same things could.not have been accomplished without producing such.a revolution. Most assuredly they might....Some.usages have been abolished on just grounds, but.they were such that if they had stood as they were to.all eternity, they would little detract from the.happiness and prosperity of any state. The.improvements of the National Assembly are.superficial, their errors fundamental..Whatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather.to recommend to our neighbors the example of the.British constitution than to take models from them.for the improvement of our own. In the former, they.have got an invaluable treasure. They are not, I think,.without some causes of apprehension and complaint,.but these they do not owe to their constitution but to.their own conduct. I think our happy situation owing.to our constitution, but owing to the whole of it, and.not to any part singly, owing in a great measure to.what we have left standing in our several reviews and.reformations as well as to what we have altered or.superadded. Our people will find employment.enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent.spirit in guarding what they possess from violation. I.would not exclude alteration neither, but even when.I changed, it should be to preserve. I should be led to.my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I.should follow the example of our ancestors. I would.make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style.of the building. A politic caution, a guarded.circumspection, a moral rather than a complexional.timidity were among the ruling principles of our.forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being.illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of.France tell us they have got so abundant a share, they.acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and.fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus.fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct.attended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution.if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their.bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let us preserve.what they have left; and, standing on the firm ground.of the British constitution, let us be satisfied to.admire rather than attempt to follow in their.desperate flights the aeronauts of France.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the  countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between 5 the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people that $\mathrm{He}$ has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile ... working-folk10 of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes-the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a15 history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands ... a history of soldiers, who carried the flag20 across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century ... a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous 25 reasoning we find ourselves to-day....Think of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic's laws cover those islands with justice and safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans30 who will invade ... the Philippines when a liberal government ... shall establish order and equity there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who will build a . . civilization of energy and industry in Cuba, when a government of law35 replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!think of the prosperous millions that Empress of Islands will support when, obedient to the law of political gravitation, her people ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the40 Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great Republic!\section{Passage 2}If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the45 Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.The Filipinos do not need any encouragement 50 from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, "Give me liberty or give me death," he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or 75 spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so80 low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also85 calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: It is well known that some animal species use.camouflage to hide from predators. Individuals that.are able to blend in to their surroundings and avoid.being eaten are able to survive longer, reproduce, and.thus increase their fitness (pass along their genes to.the next generation) compared to those who stand.out more. This may seem like a good strategy, and.fairly common in the animal kingdom, but who ever.heard of a plant doing the same thing?.In plants, the use of coloration or pigmentation as.a vital component of acquiring food (e.g.,.photosynthesis) or as a means of attracting.pollinators (e.g., flowers) has been well studied..However, variation in pigmentation as a means of.escaping predation has received little attention..Matthew Klooster from Harvard University and.colleagues empirically investigated whether the dried.bracts (specialized leaves) on a rare woodland plant,.Monotropsis odorata, might serve a similar purpose.as the stripes on a tiger or the grey coloration of the.wings of the peppered moth: namely, to hide..“Monotropsis odoratais a fascinating plant.species, as it relies exclusively upon mycorrhizal.fungus, that associates with its roots, for all of the.resources it needs to live,” notes Klooster. “Because.this plant no longer requires photosynthetic.pigmentation (i.e., green coloration) to produce its.own energy, it is free to adopt a broader range of.possibilities in coloration, much like fungi or.animals.”.Using a large population ofMonotropsis odorata,.Klooster and colleagues experimentally removed the.dried bracts that cover the 3- to 5-cm tall stems and.flower buds of these woodland plants. The bracts are.a brown color that resembles the leaf litter from.which the reproductive stems emerge and cover the.pinkish-purple colored buds and deep purple stems..When Klooster and colleagues measured the.reflectance pattern (the percentage of light reflected.at various wavelengths) of the different plant parts,.they indeed found that the bracts functioned as.camouflage, making the plant blend in with its.surroundings; the bract reflectance pattern closely.resembled that of the leaf litter, and both differed.from that of the reproductive stem and flowers.hidden underneath the bracts. Furthermore, they.experimentally demonstrated that this camouflage.actually worked to hide the plant from its predators.and increased its fitness. Individuals with intact.bracts suffered only a quarter of the herbivore.damage and produced a higher percentage of mature.fruits compared to those whose bracts were removed..“It has long been shown that animals use cryptic.coloration (camouflage) as a defense mechanism to.visually match a component of their natural.environment, which facilitates predator avoidance,”.Klooster said. “We have now experimentally.demonstrated that plants have evolved a similar.strategy to avoid their herbivores.”.Drying its bracts early to hide its reproductive.parts is a good strategy when the stems are exposed.to predators for long periods of time: all the other.species in the subfamily Monotropoideae have.colorful fleshy bracts and are reproductively active.for only a quarter of the length of time. Somewhat.paradoxically, however,Monotropsis odorataactually.relies on animals for pollination and seed dispersal..How does it accomplish this when it is disguised as.dead leaf material and is able to hide so well? The.authors hypothesize that the flowers emit highly.fragrant odors that serve to attract pollinators and.seed dispersal agents; indeed they observed bumble.bees finding and pollinating many reproductive.stems that were entirely hidden by the leaf litter itself.

Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.Let every American, every lover of liberty, every.well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the.Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,.the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their.violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did.to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so.to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every.American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred.honor;—let every man remember that to violate the.law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to.tear the character of his own, and his children’s.liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by.every American mother, to the lisping babe, that.prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in.seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in.Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be.preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative.halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,.let it become thepolitical religionof the nation;.and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,.the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and.colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its.altars.....When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of.all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there.are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,.for the redress of which, no legal provisions have.been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do.mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,.should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they.continue in force, for the sake of example, they.should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided.cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be.made for them with the least possible delay; but, till.then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with..There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress.by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,.the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two.positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right.within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of.all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and.therefore proper to be prohibited by legal.enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition.of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable..Passage 2.Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey.them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey.them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress.them at once? Men generally, under such a.government as this, think that they ought to wait.until they have persuaded the majority to alter them..They think that, if they should resist, the remedy.would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the.government itself that the remedy is worse than the.evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to.anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not.cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist.before it is hurt?....If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of.the machine of government, let it go, let it go;.perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the.machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or.a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,.then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy.will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a.nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice.to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be.a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have.to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to.the wrong which I condemn..As for adopting the ways which the State has.provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such.ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will.be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into.this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to.live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has.not everything to do, but something; and because he.cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he.should do something wrong.....I do not hesitate to say, that those who call.themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually.withdraw their support, both in person and property,.from the government...andnotwait till they.constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the.right to prevail through them. I think that it is.enough if they have God on their side, without.waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more.right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one.already.

  B: It undermines and repudiates the nation’s values.
  C: It leads slowly but inexorably to rule by the mob.
  D: It creates divisions between social groups.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  In Passage 1, Lincoln argues that every citizen should abide by the laws of the country, and that the violation of the law should not be tolerated. Even if bad laws exist, they should be enforced until they are repealed by legal means. Breaking the law is not a viable option. 
A: Choice A is not a consequence discussed in Passage 1. Instead, Lincoln argues that bad laws should still be enforced until they can be repealed through legal means.
B: Lincoln contends that breaking the law undermines the nation's values, including the rule of law and the liberty of citizens. 
C: The passage does not state that breaking the law leads to the rule by the mob. Rather, Lincoln argues that mob law is not a legitimate or justifiable means of redressing grievances. 
D: There is no discussion in Passage 1 about any divisions between social groups as a result of breaking the law. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage 1, Lincoln maintains that Americans should pledge their commitment to respect and obey the laws of the country, but that bad laws should be repealed and new laws passed to address unresolved grievances, and that no one has the right to redress grievances by breaking the law or using mob force. 
  A: Although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they continue in force, for the sake of example, they should be religiously observed. 
  B: Breaking the law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the character of his own, and his children's liberty. He urges that reverence for the laws should be part of the political religion of the nation and should be enforced in courts of justice.
  C: In any case that arises, as for instance, the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right within itself and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong and therefore proper to be prohibited by legal enactments, but in neither case is the interposition of mob law justifiable.
  D: There is no indication that breaking the law creates divisions between social groups in Passage 1. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that Americans should never violate the laws of the country, and should not tolerate violations of the laws by others.

  A: Passage 1 argues that bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, but should be observed while they continue to be in force.
  B: The correct answer. Passage 1 argues that violating the law undermines the character of one's own and one's children's liberty, and tramples on the blood of one's father. The author believes that breaking the law is a serious violation of the fundamental values of the nation.
  C: Passage 1 argues that there is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law, and that mob law is neither necessary, justifiable nor excusable. The author urges Americans to enforce the laws in the courts of justice, rather than by taking the law into their own hands.
  D: Passage 1 does not address the issue of social divisions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: In Passage 1, Lincoln argues in favor of strictly observing the laws, but acknowledges that bad laws can exist and should be repealed. He qualifies that in the meantime, bad laws should be obeyed for the sake of setting a good example. He argues that any grievances for which there are no legal provisions should be corrected through legal means rather than through mob law. Breaking the law could carry legal and social consequences, but he does not discuss those specific outcomes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage 1, Lincoln urges upon the Americans, to swear never to violate the laws of the country and never to tolerate their violation by others. He argues that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father and his own and his children’s liberty, and Violation of the laws undermines the very foundation of the nation. Therefore, he advises the Americans to follow the laws religiously, even if they are not good laws, they should be borne with for the sake of example and until an alternative is created. 
  A: The slow repeal of bad laws is not mentioned in Passage 1 as a consequence of breaking the law.
  B: Lincoln argues that breaking the law undermines and repudiates the values of the nation and, in fact, tramples on the blood of the fathers who fought for liberty, including its laws and government.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: Based on Passage 2, Meltzer and his team relied on what evidence to challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis?
Choices:
  A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact
  B: The discovery of additional Clovis artifacts in a host of sites besides the 29 initially identified
  C: Analyses showing that nanodiamonds can occur in geologic formations lacking indications of extraterrestrial impacts
  D: High concentrations of iridium that have been found in sedimentary layers beneath the proposed impact layer
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 is discussing the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago. Meltzer and his team challenge the hypothesis, stating that only three of the 29 sites examined fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset. Radiocarbon dating is a process, which can be subject to error.  
  A: Meltzer and his team reevaluated the dates assigned to the sites thought to provide evidence for the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, and found that only three of the 29 sites examined fell within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset dating about 12,800 years ago. 
  B: The discovery of additional Clovis artifacts in a host of sites besides the 29 initially identified is not discussed in Passage 2. 
  C: Analyses showing that nanodiamonds can occur in geologic formations lacking indications of extraterrestrial impacts is not discussed in Passage 2.

  Passage 2 refers to a paper, in which Meltzer and his team challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. They look at the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision.
  A: This choice accurately describes the evidence that Meltzer and his team relied on to challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. They reevaluated the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact; they argue that when the quality and accuracy of the dating is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset about 12,800 years ago; and that the other sites were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.
  B: This choice is not mentioned in Passage 2 and is irrelevant to the challenge made by Meltzer and his team.
  C: This choice refers to a counter-argument made by those who dispute the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. It is mentioned in the passage that some specialists in the relevant fields have argued that nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological formations and magnetic particles could come from ordinary fires.
  D: This choice is a piece of evidence cited by those who support the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. It is mentioned in passage 1 that the new evidence comes in the form of geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America—9 of them Clovis.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.

  The researchers made half the plants more fragrant by adding 1,4-dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers. 
  They also wanted to know whether extra beetles would impose a double cost by both damaging flowers and deterring bees. 
  Double the normal number of beetles were seen on fragrance-enhanced blossoms and pollinators did not prefer the highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent, and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often than normal ones.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a study done to find out whether increasing the fragrance of Texas gourd flowers would attract more pollinators.
  The reasoning seems to suggest that more fragrance should attract more pollinators, but extra scent could also attract more beetles, which are bad for the flowers.
  The study found that doubling the scent of the flowers did not increase the number of pollinators, but it did attract double the number of beetles. This resulted in reduced pollination and ultimately, reduced seed set in the gourds.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The article is about a study on Texas gourd plants and the interactions between their floral scent, pollinators, and pests.
  The Texas gourd vine's main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent.
  The aroma of the Texas gourd plant includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant and the only one that lures squash bees into traps is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
  The researchers made half of the plants more fragrant by tucking 1,4-dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
The author indicates that it seems initially plausible that Texas gourd plants could attract more pollinators if they increased their floral scent.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses how to attract enough pollinators without attracting too many beetles to Texas gourd plants.
  Nina Theis and Lynn Adler conducted a study to see if more floral scent would attract more pollinators without attracting more beetles.
  The study showed that heightened fragrance could actually deter pollinators and reduce seed set.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The article discusses a study done on Texas gourd vines to determine how to attract enough pollinators but not too many of the bad guys, beetles. One solution the researchers tested was increasing the floral scent using a specific compound.
A: The article makes no mention that Texas gourd plants would attract more pollinators if they had non-aromatic flowers. Instead, it discusses how increasing the aroma (specifically with a certain compound) affected pollinators and beetles.
B: The article discusses the main pollinators of Texas gourd vines and how they responded to the flower's scent. It does not mention targeting insects other than bees as a solution to attracting more pollinators.
C: The article describes how researchers tested the idea that increasing the Texas gourd vine's floral scent would attract more pollinators. However, the study found that the pollinators did not prefer the highly-scented flowers, and they were actually repelled by the abundance of beetles.
D: The article describes how the Texas gourd vine's floral scent includes 10 compounds, but one compound in particular (1,4-dimethoxybenzene) is the most abundant and was found to lure squash bees into traps. The article does not suggest that emitting more varied fragrant compounds would attract more pollinators.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The article describes an experiment designed to test whether increasing the floral scent of Texas gourd plants would attract more pollinators or increase the number of beetles that damage the plant.
  The researchers found that increasing the scent of the Texas gourd's flowers did not increase the number of pollinators visiting the flowers but did increase the number of beetles damaging the flowers.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses a study about how to attract enough pollinators to Texas gourd plants without attracting too many striped cucumber beetles, which damage flowers and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  Researchers hypothesized that increasing the amount of the most abundant aromatic compound in the plants' scent, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, could attract more pollinators. However, they were also concerned that increasing the scent would attract more beetles.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 7:
Knowledge: The article discusses a study on the Texas gourd plant and its pollinators. The researchers wanted to determine how to attract enough pollinators without also attracting too many beetles that could damage the flowers and transmit bacterial wilt disease. They focused on the Texas gourd's most abundant aromatic compound, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, to determine if increasing its aroma would attract more pollinators. The study found that increasing the fragrance of the plant did not attract more pollinators, but it did attract more beetles, which reduced the number of seeds produced. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses a study on the pollination of Texas gourd plants.
  The Texas gourd vine attracts honey bees and specialized squash bees through its floral scent which includes 10 compounds.
  The most abundant compound, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, was found to lure squash bees.
  The study aimed to find out if increasing the amount of this compound would attract more pollinators and if it would also attract striped cucumber beetles, which damage the flowers and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  The experiment involved planting 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and making half the plants more fragrant by adding 1,4-dimethoxybenzene. The other half of the plants had no added fragrance.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses an experiment on Texas gourd plants designed to investigate whether an increase in the plants' scent would attract more pollinators, and whether such an increase would repel pollinators due to an abundance of cucumber beetles that are attracted to the plants’ scent.
  A: The article does not suggest that Texas gourd plants would attract more pollinators if they did not have aromatic flowers.
  B: The article does not suggest that Texas gourd plants would attract more pollinators if they targeted insects other than bees.
  C: The article indicates that Texas gourd plants emit a floral scent that attracts pollinators such as honey bees and specialized squash bees, and that the aroma contains many compounds. Additionally, the experiment showed that when the flowers were made more fragrant with a specific compound, they did not attract more pollinators but did attract more beetles, which in turn decreased seed production in the plant. Therefore, the article suggests that increasing the floral scent with a specific compound, such as 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, can attract more beetles and reduce pollination by bees.
  D: The article does not suggest that Texas gourd plants would attract more pollinators if they emitted more varied fragrant compounds.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, "Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."40 He picked up a bird shape: "Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought." He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: "Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind."As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. "Look here," Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. "See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this." And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. "The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price."I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.

Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.
Question: Which choice best describes the state of mind that Gallaher’s return inspires in Little Chandler?

  Little Chandler is a clerk, who is not particularly happy with his life and job.
  As he thinks about Gallaher, Little Chandler remembers his own past and the many signs he had seen of Gallaher's future success.

Answer:
Action: Answer("A")
Little Chandler is impressed by Gallaher's success, but thinking about it reminds him of his own unhappy life. The text says that "Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s invitation and of the great city of London where Gallaher lived." However, "He felt how useless it was to struggle against fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the ages had bequeathed to him." Little Chandler recognizes that Gallaher is talented, and recognizes his success. His melancholy suggests a feeling of inferiority, however, allowing us to see that he is not happy with his lot in life.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Little Chandler's thoughts about his former friend, Gallaher, who has become successful and lives in London. 
  Little Chandler thinks about the changes in their lives over the past eight years and becomes sad, feeling that it is useless to struggle against fortune.
  Little Chandler is described as a small, refined man who takes care of his appearance and is shy about reading poetry to his wife.
  He walks through the city streets apprehensively at night, avoiding noisy places and dark, narrow streets.
  He remembers Ignatius Gallaher in shabby and necessitous guise but is impressed by Gallaher’s transformation into a brilliant figure on the London press.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Little Chandler’s friend Gallaher had achieved a great deal of success in contrast to Little Chandler’s own relatively mundane life. He eagerly awaits his meeting with Gallaher.
  
  A: This choice includes two conflicting ideas; 1) Little Chandler is impressed by Gallaher’s success, and 2) Thinking about it calls to mind his own unhappiness. While the first statement is correct since Chandler is indeed impressed by Gallaher’s success, there is no evidence in the text to support the second statement.
  
  B: There is no indication in the text that Little Chandler wants to downplay Gallaher’s achievements in an attempt to make his own look better. He is simply admiring Gallaher’s success as a highly esteemed friend from his past. 
  
  C: There is no indication in the text that Little Chandler is envious of Gallaher’s success or angry about how he achieved it. 
  
  D: This choice accurately describes Little Chandler’s state of mind. He admires Gallaher's success, yet at the same time, he is thankful that he has not been spoiled by such success like Gallaher was, and he cherishes his inconspicuous life.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes how Little Chandler is a small, refined man who takes great care of his appearance and is saddened by his own lack of success. He is excited about Gallaher's invitation to visit him in London, and seems to admire Gallaher's professional success.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, in studying the Venus flytrap, Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of which type of evidence?
Choices:
  A: Mathematical models to predict the electrical charge required to close the Venus flytrap
  B: Analysis of data collected from previous researchers' work involving the Venus flytrap's response to electricity
  C: Information obtained from monitoring the Venus flytrap's response to varying amounts of electrical current
  D: Published theories of scientists who developed earlier models of the Venus flytrap
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about the various experiments and studies conducted by researchers to understand how the Venus flytrap closes and retains the memory of its prey to close the trap. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close, and to test the model they rigged up very fine electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. 

A: The mathematical models proposed by Hodick and Sievers explain how the Venus flytrap might store the memory of the prey, but Volkov and his colleagues used electrodes to test if electricity was needed to close the Venus flytrap. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
B: The passage does not mention any analysis of data collected from previous researchers' work.
C: The study conducted by Volkov and his colleagues used fine electrodes and electrical current to determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. Therefore, this option is correct.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect

Choices:
  A: remnants of differentiated asteroids that were destroyed in collisions in the asteroid belt.
  B: created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.
  C: formed on terrestrial planets and ejected into the asteroid belt by collisions with primitive asteroids.
  D: formed in the region of the terrestrial planets but knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with the parent bodies of primitive asteroids.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
Iron fragments are found in the asteroid belt, but rocky fragments are much less common, and the "missing mantle problem" remains unresolved. William Bottke and his colleagues suggest that parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in a region that now contains the terrestrial planets. The objects in this region would have been more tightly packed, so collisions would have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt. Many differentiated bodies were disrupted by collisions and fragments from these bodies were scattered into the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron fragments survived for the age of the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the problem of the missing mantle of iron parent bodies and the possible explanations for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  Bottke and his colleagues suggest that the iron fragments in the asteroid belt were formed closer to the Sun and were disrupted by violent collisions. The fragments from the disrupted iron parent bodies were then scattered into the asteroid belt. Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage mentions William Bottke and his colleagues explaining the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  A: This choice is incorrect because it mentions remnants of differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt, which were not mentioned as being the source of iron fragments by Bottke and his colleagues.
  B: This choice is the most likely answer because it matches the explanation given by Bottke and his colleagues. They suggest that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed in the closer region to the Sun, where objects were more tightly packed. The resulting more frequent collisions would have disrupted most differentiated bodies. Some fragments would have been scattered into the asteroid belt by gravitational perturbations from larger bodies. Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system. Primitive meteorites formed later in the asteroid belt, where most of them survived, leaving an asteroid belt that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and iron fragments that Bottke and his colleagues attribute to the parent bodies of meteorites formed closer to the Sun.
  C & D: These choices are incorrect because they present explanations that are not mentioned in the passage as given by Bottke and his colleagues.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
Bottke and his colleagues explain the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt by asserting that the fragments were formed in the region near the Sun (closer than the asteroid belt) and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of larger objects.    
A: This choice incorrectly uses the term "remnants of differentiated asteroids" which is inaccurate according to the passage. 
B: This choice correctly describes the proposal made by Bottke and his colleagues. 
C: This choice suggests that the iron fragments were created on the terrestrial planets which is not in line with what Bottke and his colleagues proposed. 
D: This choice incorrectly suggests that the iron fragments were formed in the region of the terrestrial planets. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Bottke and his colleagues came up with a possible explanation for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  A: Bottke and his colleagues did not attribute the presence of iron fragments to remnants of differentiated asteroids that were destroyed in collisions in the asteroid belt.
  B: According to the passage, Bottke and his colleagues explain that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more tightly packed near the Sun, so collisions would have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt. Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions. Iron fragments from these disrupted objects were scattered into the asteroid belt by gravitational perturbations from larger bodies. 
  C: Bottke and his colleagues did not suggest that iron fragments were formed on terrestrial planets and ejected into the asteroid belt by collisions with primitive asteroids.
  D: Option D is the correct explanation according to the passage. Bottke and his colleagues proposed that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed in the region of the terrestrial planets but were knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with the parent bodies of primitive asteroids. This is in part due to the idea that objects would have been more tightly packed near the Sun, so collisions would have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt. Iron fragments from these disrupted objects were scattered into the asteroid belt by gravitational perturbations from larger bodies. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Bottke and his colleagues propose a possible explanation for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  According to Bottke and his colleagues, parent bodies of the iron fragments formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets.
  Objects nearer to the Sun would have been more tightly packed, leading to more frequent collisions than in the asteroid belt.
  Differentiated bodies were rare and were disrupted by collisions, and gravitational perturbations scattered some of those fragments into the asteroid belt.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Bottke and his colleagues recently came up with a possible explanation for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  A: This choice is incorrect; it describes a process that leads to the destruction of differentiated asteroids.
  B: The passage states that Bottke and his colleagues believe that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites were formed closer to the Sun in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets, and they were disrupted by collisions, sending some fragmented material into the asteroid belt.
  C: This choice is incorrect; it describes a process of how primitive asteroids were ejected into the asteroid belt, but it is not relevant to the explanation provided by Bottke and his colleagues for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  D: The passage states that Bottke and his colleagues believe that the iron fragments were created in the region of the terrestrial planets but were disrupted and knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with other bodies.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage suggests that iron fragments in the asteroid belt survive better than rocky fragments.
  William Bottke and his colleagues propose that parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun and were more tightly packed. They suggest that many differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions, and gravitational perturbations scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and rocky fragments ended up in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  William Bottke and his colleagues came up with a possible explanation for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt. The explanation has to do with the location where the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed.
  A: According to the passage, Bottke and his colleagues did not propose that the iron fragments were remnants of differentiated asteroids destroyed in collisions in the asteroid belt. Rather, they proposed that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed in a different region from where the primitive meteorites formed.
  B: According to the passage, Bottke and his colleagues proposed that perhaps the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in a region that now contains the terrestrial planets. The tighter packing and more frequent collisions in that region could have led to the survival of stronger iron fragments and their scattering into the asteroid belt.
  C: According to the passage, Bottke and his colleagues did not propose that the iron fragments were formed on terrestrial planets and ejected into the asteroid belt by collisions with primitive asteroids.
  D: According to the passage, Bottke and his colleagues proposed that perhaps the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed in the region of the terrestrial planets but were knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with the parent bodies of primitive asteroids.

Context: \section{Passage 1}Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together, to a house divided against itself, and says that it is  contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.When did he learn, and by what authority does he proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that "a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand." Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a "house divided against itself." They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What does the author imply about pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation?
Choices:
  A: They communicate with each other in the same way as do ibises.
  B: They have the same migration routes as those of ibises.
  C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises.
  D: They expend more energy than do ibises.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that ibises fly in a V-formation and carefully position their wingtips to catch the preceding bird's updraft- and save energy during flight.
  The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese.
  Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult.
Action: Answer("C")  
The author implies that pelicans, storks, and geese create a wake similar to that of ibises when migrating in a V-formation.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The article mentions that ibises fly in a V formation to save energy during flight.
  The article also mentions that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese.
  However, smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult.
Action: Answer("C") 
The article implies that pelicans, storks, and geese create a similar wake to that of ibises when they fly in a V formation.
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage mentions that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese. The oscillating eddies coming off of a bird make currents significantly less stable than an airplane flying in a V-formation, but IBIS scientists based in Europe found that ibises flying in a V-flying formation carefully position their wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.

A: The passage does not provide information about whether pelicans, storks, and geese communicate with each other in the same way as do ibises, so this is not the correct answer. 

B: Although it is mentioned that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, the passage does not state that these birds have the same migration routes as those of ibises. So, this is not the correct answer. 

C: The passage states that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, implying that these birds might fly in a V formation and create similar wake to that of ibises. So, this is the correct answer.

D: The passage does not state that pelicans, storks, and geese expend more energy than do ibises. So, this is not the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses a study of ibises that found that birds fly in a V formation to save energy during flight by catching the preceding bird's updraft. Many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same as planes, and they save energy by drafting off each other. Pelicans, storks, and geese are mentioned as long-winged birds but smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult.
A: The article does not mention how pelicans, storks, and geese communicate with each other during flight.
B: The article does not mention whether pelicans, storks, and geese have the same migration routes as those of ibises.
C: The article states that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, that catch the uplifting eddies. 
D: The article does not mention that pelicans, storks, and geese expend more energy than ibises during flight.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses how migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation and why scientists have long debated the reason why. The study focuses on the Northern bald ibises. The article mentions that pelicans, storks, and geese are long-winged birds that are likely to benefit from this flying pattern. 
  A: The article does not mention anything about how these birds communicate with each other.
  B: The article does not indicate that they have the same migration routes as those of ibises.
  C: According to the author, these birds, like ibises, are likely to benefit from drafting off each other by positioning themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. The article says, "The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says."
  D: The article does not state that these birds expend more energy than do ibises.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a study of ibises showing that birds in a V formation carefully position their wingtips and sync their flapping, theoretically to catch the preceding bird's updraft and save energy during flight. 
  The study used a microlight plane to show hand-raised Northern bald ibises their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy.
  The study found that the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. 
  The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
The author implies that pelicans, storks, and geese create a similar wake to that of ibises in a V formation.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses research on how ibises fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies of the preceding bird and minimize the effects of the downdrafts coming from the back of the bird. Pelicans, storks, and geese are also mentioned as examples of long-winged birds that likely fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation.
  
A: The article does not provide any information on how pelicans, storks, and geese communicate with each other in flight. 
B: The article does not provide any information on whether pelicans, storks, and geese have the same migration routes as ibises. 
C: The article implies that pelicans, storks, and geese create a similar wake to that of ibises, making it possible for them to save energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation. 
D: The article does not provide any information on whether pelicans, storks, and geese expend more energy than ibises while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains that ibises fly in a V formation to save energy during migration.
  The study, published in Nature, states that just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the ibises positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. 

  The authors suggest that pelicans, storks, and geese may fly in the same formation since they are long-winged birds, but the passage does not provide any information about their communication, migration routes, or energy expenditure.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The article states that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese. Since they are also long-winged birds, it is likely that they fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation to save energy and catch the uplift of the updraft. The article does not provide information regarding their communication, migration routes, or energy consumption compared to ibises.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage explains that some birds fly in a V formation to save energy during flight, positioning themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front and timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. The study of ibises found that these big-winged birds carefully position their wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft to save energy during flight. The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese.

A: The passage does not state anything about whether pelicans, storks, and geese communicate with each other in the same way as ibises.

B: The passage does not state anything about whether pelicans, storks, and geese have the same migration routes as those of ibises.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.
Question: Based on the passages, both authors would agree with which of the following claims?
Choices:
  A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
  B: Men often work selflessly for political change.
  C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.
  D: Political activism is as important for women as it is for men.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1: talks about how women have an important role in society, but this role is different than the role of men. Their power comes from kindness, generosity, peacefulness, and benevolence, and they should seek to have influence through these channels. Women can work with other women to assist in appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty, but they should avoid coercive influences that throw them out of their appropriate sphere.
  Passage 2: argues that men and women have the same moral nature and, therefore, essentially the same rights. Thus, whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1: Talks about the role and duties of women in society. A woman's power is in making herself respected and loved to influence men in the domestic sphere. Political power is not part of a woman's sphere of influence.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: The primary purpose of the passage is to
Choices:
  A: discuss findings that offer a scientific explanation for the Venus flytrap's closing action.
  B: present research that suggests that the Venus flytrap's predatory behavior is both complex and unique among plants.
  C: identify the process by which the Venus flytrap's closing action has evolved.
  D: provide a brief overview of the Venus flytrap and its predatory behavior.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")  
The primary purpose of the passage is to discuss findings that offer a scientific explanation for the Venus flytrap's closing action. The passage provides detailed information on the mechanism by which the plant stores information and reacts to a stimulus by closing its trap. It also presents research done by scientists on this topic over the years. Therefore, option A is the most accurate choice. The other options are either too broad, too narrow, or unsupported by the information provided in the passage.
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage mainly talks about the Venus flytrap, its characteristics, and how it stores and retrieves information from its encounter with the prey before closing on it. The authors talk about different theories of how this mechanism works, and provide evidence to support one of these theories.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage extensively discusses the Venus Flytrap and its mechanism for trapping prey. It provides information about how the plant stores and uses short-term memory by means of an electric charge in its leaves. Also, it explains that scientists were puzzled by these questions and proposes a theory on how the plant encodes and stores the information from the bug's encounter.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the process by which the Venus flytrap determines when to close its trap in response to potential prey.
  The process involves the stimulation of trigger hairs, which causes an electrical action potential that induces calcium channels to open, resulting in an increase in calcium ions.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium ions to close.
  If a second hair is stimulated within about 20 seconds, the trap will close.
  The encoding of the information about the first hair being stimulated is thought to be stored in the concentration of calcium ions.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage explains the Venus flytrap's predatory activity, including its sensory mechanism, memory, and electric discharge that triggers the trap's closing. It also explains how scientists were puzzled by how the plant stores the information from the first hair and remembers it for the second. Finally, it highlights a model proposed by Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers to describe how the plant encodes and stores the memory of the encounter with the first hair.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
 The passage discusses the Venus flytrap and how it detects and responds to prey. Scientists have been curious about how the Venus flytrap encodes and stores information from contact with its "hairs", as well as how it remembers this information to respond to a second touch. The passage specifically discusses studies by Dieter Hodick and Alexander Volkov, which suggest that electricity plays a key role in the Venus flytrap's mechanism (from the opening of calcium channels to trigger closure). 
A: The passage presents studies and research that offer a scientific explanation for the Venus flytrap's closing action, specifically highlighting the role of electricity. 
B, C, D: While the passage does present research on the complexity of the Venus flytrap's behavior, it does not discuss the evolution of this behavior or provide a broad overview of the plant.

Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.The brains of humans are conspicuously larger than the.brains of other apes, but the human-specific genetic.factors responsible for the uniquely large human.neocortex remain obscure. Since humans split from.chimps, which have brains roughly a third of human size,.the human genome has undergone roughly 15 million.changes. Which of these genetic tweaks could have led to.big brains?.About six years ago, scientists in David Haussler’s lab at.Howard Hughes Medical Institute discovered a gene called.NOTCH2NL. It’s a relative of NOTCH2, a gene that.scientists knew was central to early brain development..NOTCH2 controls vital decisions regarding when and how.many neurons to make..When the Haussler team looked in the official version.of the human genome at that time^1 —version 37—.NOTCH2NL appeared to be located in chromosome 1.near a region linked to abnormal brain size. Delete a hunk.of the region, and brains tend to shrink. Duplicate part of.it, and brains tend to overgrow..“We thought, ‘Oh, this is incredible,’” Haussler said..NOTCH2NL seemed to check all the boxes for a key role.in human brain development. But when the team mapped.NOTCH2NL’s precise location in the genome, they.discovered the gene wasn’t actually in the relevant.chromosomal region after all; the once-promising.candidate seemed to be a dud..“We were downhearted,” Haussler recalled. That all.changed with the next official version of the human.genome—version 38. In this iteration, NOTCH2NL was.located in the crucial region. “And there were three.versions of it,” Haussler exclaimed. Over the last three.million years, his team calculated, NOTCH2NL was.repeatedly copy-pasted into the genome, what he calls “a.series of genetic accidents.”.Genetic analysis of several primate species revealed that.the three genes exist only in humans and their recent.relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, not in.chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. What’s more, the.timing of these genes’ emergence matches up with the.period in the fossil record when our ancestors’ craniums.began to enlarge, Haussler points out. Together, the results.suggest that NOTCH2NL genes played a role in beefing.up human brain size..Passage 2.Modern humans have brains that are more than three.times larger than our closest living relatives,.chimpanzees and bonobos. Scientists don’t agree on.when and how this dramatic increase took place, but.new analysis of 94 hominin fossils shows that average.brain size increased gradually and consistently over the.past three million years..The research, published in The Proceedings of the.Royal Society B, shows that the trend was caused.primarily by evolution of larger brains within.populations of individual species, but the introduction of.new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones also played a part..“Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that.makes us human. It’s related to cultural complexity,.language, tool making and all these other things that.make us unique,” said Andrew Du, PhD, a postdoctoral.scholar at the University of Chicago and first author of.the study. “The earliest hominins had brain sizes like.chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since.then. So, it’s important to understand how we got here.”.Du and his colleagues compared published research.data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13.different species, beginning with the earliest.unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including.Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size.began to overlap with that of modern-day humans..The researchers saw that when the species were.counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a.common ancestor, the average brain size increased.gradually over three million years. Looking more closely,.the increase was driven by three different factors,.primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within.individual species populations, but also by the addition.of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones..The study quantifies for the first time when and by.how much each of these factors contributes to the clade-.level pattern. Du said he likens it to how a football coach.might build a roster of bigger, strong players. One way.would be to make all the players hit the weight room to.bulk up. But the coach could also recruit new, larger.players and cut the smallest ones..(^1) The reference version of the human genome goes through updates to.more completely map out each chromosomal sequence.

Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these "low-threshold" nerves "C-tactile," or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations

They sought out a patient with an unusual nerve defect to test gentile brushing and CT fibers' role.
A: From the 1999 experiment with G.L., it can be inferred that one of the intended goals was to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey since her arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers, and functional MRI studies were used to examine which areas of the brain lit up during the experiment. Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The 1999 experiment aimed to investigate whether CT fibers could convey pleasurable sensations, as well as whether they could distinguish between different types of touch stimuli and locations on the body.
  A: The passage states that the experiment aimed to determine whether the same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the arm, and whether CT fibers can convey a pleasant sensation. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey was one of the intended goals of the experiment. 
  B: The passage presents that CT fibers can only be found in hairy human skin and do not respond to gentle stroking of hairless skin on the palms and soles of the feet. However, no further information is given about the relationship between body hair and CT fiber function. 
  C: The passage provides some information about the role of CT fibers in the perception of pain, noting that they are unresponsive to noxious stimuli like pinpricks. However, the experiment was not focused on the role played by CT fibers in the perception of pain, but rather on investigating whether CT fibers convey a pleasant sensation. 
  D: The passage mentions that microneurography was used in the experiment to capture the electrical impulses of nerve fibers and measure how quickly they fired. However, the effect of microneurography on CT fiber signaling was not a focus of the experiment. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The 1999 experiment conducted by Olausson's group sought to test if a slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the arm. The experiment also aimed to determine if the same slow fiber can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather, and whether that same fiber can convey a pleasant sensation.
A: The 1999 experiment focused on investigating the various characteristics of the CT (C-tactile) fibers, including their sensitivity to touch, and their function in conveying pleasure through gentle brushing. Thus, it can be reasonably inferred that one of the intended goals of the experiment was to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.

Context: A pair of recent studies suggests that although.industrialized nations may have benefitted from larger.cities, the same is not true for the rapidly urbanizing areas of.the developing world. In these parts of the globe, there really.might be such a thing as too much urbanization, too.quickly..The studies, by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez-.Pose of the London School of Economics, take a close look.at the actual connection between city size and nationwide.economic performance. Their initial study, from last year,.examines the relationship between economic development,.as measured by GDP per capita, and average metropolitan-.area size in 114 countries across the world between 1960.and 2010. To ensure robustness, it controls for variables.including national population size, physical land area,.education levels, economic openness, and other factors..The size of cities or metro areas across the world has.exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the.developing world growing much faster and much larger.than those in more developed nations. Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew.modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median.city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding.from 220,000 to 845,000 people. In 1960, 12 of the top 20.countries with the largest average city size were high-.income countries; by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the.developing world..Urbanization has historically been thought of as a.necessary feature of economic development and growth, but.this study finds the connection is not so simple. While.advanced nations benefit from having larger cities,.developing nations do not. Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every.additional 100,000 in average population among its large.cities over a five-year period. But for developing nations, the.addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year.period..In their latest study, the researchers found that.developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck.from smaller and medium-size cities. These countries see.the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion.of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people.or less. Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic.impact in larger countries. Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic.benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million.or more, according to the study. This makes sense:.Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play.host to knowledge-based industries that require urban.agglomeration economies..There are several reasons why megacities^1 often fail to.spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world..For one, the lion’s share of places that are urbanizing.most rapidly today are in the poorest and least-.developed parts of the world, whereas the places that.urbanized a century or so ago were in the richest and.most developed. This history has created a false.expectation that urbanization is always associated with.prosperity..Additionally, globalization has severed the historical.connection between cities, local agriculture, and local.industry that powered the more balanced urban.economic development of the past. In today’s globally.interconnected economy, the raw materials that flowed.from the surrounding countryside to the city can all be.inexpensively imported from other parts of the world..The result is that the connection between large cities and.growth has now become much more tenuous, producing.a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without.growth.”.The researchers used multiple variables to calculate a weighted average.city size for each country studied and reported the median of those.averages..(^1) Typically defined as cities with populations of over ten million people

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

  C: inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality.
  D: at odds with the principles of American democracy.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Both passages discuss gender roles and the potential impact of changes in those roles.
  Passage 1 argues for a more complementary view of gender roles in which men and women have distinct tasks that contribute to society.
  Passage 2 argues for complete liberty of choice in occupation, without artificial limits based on gender or class.
 
  A: Both passages suggest that gender roles are changing and that it is a positive shift towards greater equality.
  B: Neither passage suggests that the costs of changes in gender roles outweigh the benefits.
  C: While Passage 1 argues that there are distinct tasks for men and women in society, it does not suggest that these tasks are dictated by economic advantages.
  D: Neither passage suggests that changes in gender roles are at odds with the principles of American democracy.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Both passages discuss the changes in gender roles in society and argue for greater gender equality.
  A: Passage 1 believes that the social changes that bring closer social inequalities will also raise women and make them more equal to men. Passage 2 argues for complete liberty of choice and believes that society should not limit an individual's faculties based on their sex or class. Both of these ideas suggest that the authors believe that changes in gender roles would be part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
  B: There is no argument in either passage that suggests that the changes in gender roles would be unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs.
  C: There is no argument in either passage that suggests that the changes in gender roles are inevitable due to their economic advantages.
  D: Passage 1 is discussing the potential for greater equality between men and women in the democratic society. Passage 2 supports the idea of complete liberty of choice and thinks that occupations should be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any. Neither of these passages suggest that the changes in gender roles would be at odds with the principles of American democracy.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Both passages are discussing gender roles and the idea of equality between men and women. 
  Passage 1 discusses the idea of equalizing the roles of men and women to the point of having them perform identical duties, and criticizes this as degrading both sexes. Instead, it argues that the best way to improve the status of women is to create a society where each gender fulfills their unique roles to the best of their abilities. 
  Passage 2 argues that the proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. It advocates for complete liberty of choice, where every occupation is open to all without discrimination based on sex or class. 
Action: Answer("A")  
Based on the knowledge, both authors would most likely agree that changes in gender roles, that aim to promote greater gender equality, would be part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Both passages are discussing changes in gender roles.
  Passage 1 argues that social changes that bring people closer together on the basis of equality will also make women more equal to men, but warns against making men and women identical in all things.
  Passage 2 argues that equality is gradually becoming more of a principle in society, and that the equal freedom to choose one's occupation is necessary for social progress.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that social changes that bring about greater equality in general will lead to greater gender equality. The passage criticizes European attempts to make men and women alike, as it would result in weak men and disorderly women. The passage argues that the American approach is to carefully divide the duties of men and women to allow them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner.
  Passage 2 argues for a just equality between men and women, and argues that the proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. The passage argues that society should not interfere beforehand by setting arbitrary limits on individual genius, talent, energy, or force of mind based on gender or class. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Both authors are discussing gender roles and the impact of society's shift towards greater equality. 
  A: The authors agree that social change towards greater equality will affect gender roles. 
  B: There is no indication that the authors believe that the costs of shifts in gender roles outweigh the benefits.
  C: There is no indication that the authors believe that the changes in gender roles will be inevitable due to economic advantages.
  D: The authors do not suggest that the changes in gender roles are at odds with American democracy. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The two passages describe a call for greater gender equality in society. 
  Passage 1 describes how efforts to make men and women the same would lead to weak men and disorderly women, but that Americans believed in an approach that valued the distinct contributions that men and women could make. 
  Passage 2 argues for complete liberty of choice when it comes to occupations, asserting that everyone should have the opportunity to achieve their highest potential. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The two passages discuss the impact of democracy and social changes on gender roles and equality. 
  Passage 1 describes how changes in society will bring women closer to being equal with men, but criticizes the idea of forcing men and women to be identical. 
  Passage 2 argues that equality should be the general principle of human relations and that every person should be free to achieve their greatest potential regardless of their gender.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The two passages argue that greater gender equality is desirable, but that it must be achieved in a way that respects the physical and moral differences between men and women, and recognizes the unique contributions and capacities of each sex. Both authors stress the importance of allowing individuals to choose their own occupations and roles.  
A: Passage 1 argues that social changes that bring people closer together in terms of equality will eventually lead to greater gender equality. Passage 2 argues that inequality has been the basis of society in the past, but that there is now a shift toward a just equality in all human relations, including between men and women. Therefore, both authors would most likely agree that changes in gender roles would be part of a broad social shift toward greater equality. 
B: There is no indication in either passage that the authors believe that the costs of gender equality would outweigh the benefits. 
C: While there is an argument to be made that greater gender equality is economically advantageous, neither passage specifically argues this point. 
D: Passage 1 argues that some Europeans have taken equality between men and women too far, wanting to make men and women "beings not only equal but alike," which would result in weak men and disorderly women. However, neither passage suggests that gender equality is at odds with the principles of American democracy. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Both passages discuss the shift toward greater gender equality.
  A: Both passages acknowledge the social changes that will make women more equal to men. The authors believe that there should be gender equality but caution against haphazardly making men and women alike in every way. They argue that improvement comes from each sex fulfilling their respective tasks in the best possible manner. Therefore, A is the best answer.
  B: Neither passage argues that the cost of changes in gender roles outweigh their benefits. 
  C: Neither passage suggests that the inevitability of greater gender equality is due to economic reasons. 
  D: Neither passage would argue that the principles of American democracy are at odds with changes in gender roles.

We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: Based on the passage, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that
Choices:
  A: no genetic variations were common to all those finches that were not also common to all the finches that did not use that technique.
  B: those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
  C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
  D: there is probably not a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The researchers found that young woodpecker finches develop tool-oriented behavior at a similar age whether they observed adult woodpecker finches using tools or not. Woodpecker finches have a genetic predisposition for tool use, which is influenced by individual learning to improve efficiency. The researchers observed individual learning in some birds that developed a new technique which deviated from the typical tool-using behavior observed in the wild. 
A: Nothing in the passage suggests this. 
B: The passage does not indicate whether the finches stopped using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices. 
C: The fact that the new technique deviates from typical tool-using behavior and takes place inside a crevice suggests that it is unlikely to be acquired socially. 
D: The passage suggests that woodpecker finches have a genetic predisposition for tool use that may confer an advantage in survival conditions, which could favor the development of new tool-using techniques. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The researchers studied woodpecker finches to see if their use of a specific tool use behavior was acquired socially or through genetics. Based on observations, they found that non-social, individual learning played an important role in improving the efficiency of the behavior.
A: This choice is not relevant to why the researchers concluded that the woodpecker finches were displaying individual learning.
B: The fact that the finches stopped using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices could suggest that they might have been using the technique due to the shape of the crevices rather than individual learning. 
C: The fact that the portion of the technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially supports the conclusion that the woodpecker finches' use of the technique was based on individual learning.
D: This choice does not provide evidence regarding the researchers' conclusion that individual learning played a role in the development of the behavior.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses an experiment with woodpecker finches investigating whether their tool use is acquired socially or through individual learning. The researchers found that young woodpecker finches develop tool use with similar aptitude regardless of whether they have the opportunity to observe tool use or not, suggesting that the ability to use tools is strongly dependent on genetically fixed components. However, the researchers also found that non-social, individual learning plays an important role in improving the efficiency of tool use. For example, five individuals developed a novel levering technique that deviated from typical tool-using behavior.
A: This choice is not relevant to the researchers' conclusion about the role of individual learning. It discusses genetic variations, which are not mentioned as factors in how the levering technique developed.
B: This choice is not relevant to the researchers' conclusion about the role of individual learning. It discusses the researchers' alteration of the artificial crevices, which is not related to the use of individual learning.
C: This choice provides support for the researchers' conclusion about individual learning. If the levering technique is difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially because it takes place inside a crevice, this would suggest that individual learning played a role in developing the technique.
D: This choice is not relevant to the researchers' conclusion about the role of individual learning. It discusses the lack of naturally occurring circumstances that would favor the development and transmission of the technique, which is not related to the use of individual learning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:  
  The researchers’ study shows that non-social, individual learning plays an important role during the ontogeny of tool use.
  Five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.
  These birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice.
  After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage discusses a study on woodpecker finches and whether their twig tool use is acquired socially or through individual learning. The study found that young woodpecker finches can develop the ability to use tools without observing it through social learning from adults, and that the use of tool is strongly dependent on genetically fixed components. However, non-social, individual learning plays an important role during the development of tool use in improving the efficiency of behavior. Some individuals in the study even developed novel techniques that enhanced the effectiveness of tool use beyond what was observed in the wild.
A: This statement is not relevant to the researchers' conclusion that individual learning played a role in the development of tool use in some woodpecker finches.
B: This statement is not relevant to the researchers' conclusion that individual learning played a role in the development of tool use in some woodpecker finches.
C: This statement supports the researchers' conclusion that individual learning played a role in the development of tool use in some woodpecker finches. The novel technique that some finches developed deviates from typical tool use and occurs inside a crevice, making it difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
D: This statement is not relevant to the researchers' conclusion that individual learning played a role in the development of tool use in some woodpecker finches.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage discusses an experiment with woodpecker finches that investigated whether tool use is acquired socially and whether there is individual learning during the ontogeny of tool use.  The five woodpecker finches that developed the levering technique employed a new method of tool use that was not typical, and their behavior was enhanced through individual learning. 

Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The researchers' conclusion that the woodpecker finches were demonstrating individual learning in using the levering technique is supported in part by the fact that these finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique. This suggests that the shift was intentional, rather than randomly occurring, which could be indicative of individual learning. Answer A is incorrect because the passage does not discuss genetic variations in the finches and does not compare the characteristics of finches that used the technique to those that did not. Answer C is incorrect because although the crevice made it harder for other finches to observe the technique, the passage does not indicate that this factor contributed to the finches' individual learning. Answer D is irrelevant to the conclusion that individual learning took place.
Response 8:
Knowledge: The researchers investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired socially and found that social learning is not necessary for the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components.

Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The researchers concluded that individual learning plays an important role in improving the efficiency of tool use in the woodpecker finches.
  A: This choice is not relevant to the conclusion drawn by the researchers about individual learning. Genetic variations common to the finches that used or did not use the levering technique are not discussed in the passage.
  B: The passage does not mention the researchers altering the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the levering technique or any resultant change in the behavior of the birds.
  C: This choice supports the conclusion that individual learning plays an important role in the development of the levering technique because the technique deviates from typical tool-using behavior and it takes place inside a crevice which is a difficult place for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
  D: This statement is not related to the conclusion drawn by the researchers about individual learning.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The news is a form of public knowledge..Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the.health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a.Line private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge.increases in value as it is shared by more people. The.date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;.the causes and consequences of an environmental.disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular.law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all.examples of public knowledge that people are.generally expected to know in order to be considered.informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or.private knowledge, which is generally left to.individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is.promoted even to those who might not think it.matters to them. In short, the circulation of public.knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded.as a public good which cannot be solely.demand-driven..The production, circulation, and reception.of public knowledge is a complex process. It is.generally accepted that public knowledge should.be authoritative, but there is not always.common agreement about what the public needs to.know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and.how authoritative reputations should be determined.and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The.Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely.regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative.agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied.the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of.authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the.opinions of others.” As part of the general process of.the transformation of authority whereby there has.been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional.sources of public knowledge, the demand has been.for all authority to make explicit the frames of value.which determine their decisions. Centres of news.production, as our focus groups show, have not been.exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps.some news journalists feel uneasy about this.renegotiation of their authority:.Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the.“most read” lists on their own and other websites.to work out which stories matter to readers and.viewers. And now the audience—which used to.know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of.journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our.credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008)..The result of democratising access to TV news.could be political disengagement by the majority.and a dumbing down through a popularity.contest of stories (online news editor, 2007)..Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,.they amount to more than straightforward.professional defensiveness. In their reference to an.audience “which used to know its place” and.conflation between democratisation and “dumbing.down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular.mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by.experts, immune from populist pressures; and.disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive.recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down.opportunities for popular involvement in the making.of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional.claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are.right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every.institutional level in contemporary society,.scepticism towards the epistemological authority of.expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed.by several of our focus group participants, that the.news media should be “informative rather than.authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to.“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their.slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient.information” from which “we would be able to form.opinions of our own.”.At stake here are two distinct conceptions of.authority. The journalists we have quoted are.resistant to the democratisation of news:.the supremacy of the clickstream (according to.which editors raise or lower the profile of stories.according to the number of readers clicking on them.online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”.news; the demands of some audience members for.raw news rather than constructed narratives.
Question: The authors indicate that the public is coming to believethat journalists’ reports should avoid
Choices:
  A: personal judgments about the events reported.
  B: more information than is absolutely necessary.
  C: quotations from authorities on the subject matter.
  D: details that the subjects of news reports wish to keep private.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The text mentions that there is growing feeling that the news media should be "informative rather than authoritative," journalists should give the news as raw as it is and the people should be given "sufficient information" from where they would be able to form opinions of their own.
A: This answer choice is correct; the authors suggest that the public is coming to believe that journalists' reports should avoid personal judgments about the events reported, and should rather be informative enough to let the people form their own opinions.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage suggests that some members of the public are looking for a news media that is "informative rather than authoritative", that gives the news objectively ("without putting their slant on it"), and gives people enough information so that they can form their own opinions. The authors note that this can be seen as a move away from expert journalism towards more democratic news production. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The authors discuss the production, circulation, and reception of public knowledge including news. 
  There is a growing feeling that the news media should be informative without being authoritative. People want to be given sufficient information from which they can form their opinions.
  The quotations from broadcast journalist and online news editor suggest that journalists are resistant to change, and they feel uneasy about losing their authority as the shapers of authoritative agendas and conventional wisdom. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The authors suggest that there is growing sentiment among focus group participants that the news media should be "informative rather than authoritative", that journalists should simply "give the news as raw as it is, without putting their slant on it", and that people should be given "sufficient information" from which they can independently form their own opinions.

Action: Answer("A")  
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the production, circulation, and reception of public knowledge; that the circulation of public knowledge is a public good which cannot be solely demand-driven; that public knowledge should be authoritative; and that there are two distinct conceptions of authority. The authors do not indicate that the public is coming to believe that journalists’ reports should avoid more information than is absolutely necessary, quotations from authorities on the subject matter, or details that the subjects of news reports wish to keep private. Therefore, the most likely answer is A: personal judgments about the events reported.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the production, circulation, and reception of public knowledge, including the news. It highlights the complexity of the process and the difficulty in determining what the public needs to know, who should report the news, and how to evaluate the authority of news sources. Some participants in focus groups suggested that the news media should be informative rather than authoritative and that journalists should give raw news without putting their slant on it.

Action: Answer("A")  
Based on the passage, the authors indicate that there is a growing feeling that journalists' reports should avoid personal judgments about the events reported and instead provide information for individuals to form opinions of their own.
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the production and consumption of public knowledge and news reporting. The authors argue that there is a growing skepticism towards the epistemological authority of expert elites in contemporary society, and that some people believe news should be informative rather than authoritative. They advocate for a mode of public knowledge that is more open to popular involvement and critical of traditional sources of authority.

Action: Answer("A") 
The correct answer is A, because the authors mention that some participants in their focus groups believe journalists should "give the news as raw as it is, without putting their slant on it," which implies that journalists should avoid personal judgments about the events reported.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses different conceptions of authority in the production and dissemination of public knowledge, including news. It mentions a growing feeling among some people that journalists should provide "sufficient information" for readers to form their own opinions, without putting their own spin on it. There is a resistance to the democratisation of news, which gives supremacy to the clickstream and parity with popular culture. This suggests that journalists' reports should not avoid more information than is necessary.
Option A: The article does not suggest that the public is coming to believe that journalists' reports should avoid personal judgments about the events reported.
Option B: The article does not suggest that the public is coming to believe that journalists' reports should avoid more information than is absolutely necessary.
Option C: The article does not suggest that the public is coming to believe that journalists' reports should avoid quotations from authorities on the subject matter.
Option D: The article does not suggest that the public is coming to believe that journalists' reports should avoid details that the subjects of news reports wish to keep private.
Action: Answer(None of the Above)
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the idea of public knowledge and the production, circulation, and reception of news, and how it should be authoritative. It also discusses that there are different conceptions of authority in the production of public knowledge. While some journalists want to maintain their authority and shape public knowledge as experts, there is also a growing feeling among some that news should be informative rather than authoritative, and people should be given sufficient information from which to form their own opinions. 
A: This choice is consistent with the idea that journalists should give the news as raw as it is, without putting their slant on it, which some participants felt should be the job of journalists, and suggests a preference for informative news rather than authoritative news.
B: This choice is not mentioned or implied in the passage.
C: This choice is not mentioned or implied in the passage, and is inconsistent with the idea that journalists should give the news as raw as it is, without putting their slant on it.
D: This choice is not addressed in the passage, and the passage emphasizes the increasing demand for more information and transparency in the production of news, rather than suppressing information. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how the production, circulation, and reception of public knowledge, including the news, is a complex process and how there is a growing feeling that journalists should give the news as raw as it is without putting their slant on it, and that people should be given sufficient information from which "we would be able to form opinions of our own". 

Action: Answer("A") 
According to the passage, the growing feeling is that news should be informative rather than authoritative, and the job of journalists is to give the news as raw as it is, without putting their slant on it.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

  C: can be influenced by legislative reforms only indirectly.
  D: benefit the groups and institutions currently in power.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses the evolution of the principle of equality in human relations and how it applies to the relation between men and women.
  The passage suggests that gender roles have been slower to change because strong emotions and social stigmas have become attached to them
  The passage advocates for complete liberty of choice in occupations and to let individuals prove their capacities by trial, free from arbitrary labels put on them.
  A: While society used to be constituted on the basis of inequality, that does not seem to be the specific reason why gender roles would be resistant to change.
  B: The passage suggests that gender roles may be resistant to change because of the strong emotions and social stigmas that have become attached to them, rather than just being matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
  C: The passage does not discuss legislative reforms as a means of changing gender roles.
  D: The passage does not specifically suggest that gender roles benefit any particular groups or institutions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses how the relationship between men and women is changing as society shifts towards a principle of just equality. Mill suggests that gender roles are resistant to change. 
  A: While Passage 2 discusses how society was constituted on inequalities, it is not the primary reason Mill suggests gender roles are resistant to change. 
  B: Mill argues that strong emotions tied to gender roles make them challenging to change, suggesting that gender roles are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
  C: while it is true that legislative reforms could have an indirect influence on changing gender roles and the relationship between men and women,the primary reason Mill suggests gender roles are resistant to change lies in deeply entrenched tradition, rather than the indirect influence of legislative reforms.
  D: Mill does not suggest that gender roles benefit the groups and institutions currently in power as a reason for gender roles being resistant to change. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage suggests that gender roles are resistant to change.
  A: The passage does not support this conclusion.
  B: The passage supports this conclusion. Mill states that society has outgrown the old rule of inequality, but the closest and most intimate relation between men and women was the last to throw off the old rule and receive a new just equality.
  C: The passage does not support this conclusion. 
  D: The passage does not support this conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage 2, Mill writes about the slow societal transitions from an organizational framework based on inequality to one grounded on just equality.
  Mill argues that inequality existed until recently in society and expresses how relations between men and women are particularly resistant to changing this system.
  Mill notes that gender roles' resistance to change comes from traditionalism, close emotional bonds between men and women, and an old system of dominance.
  Mill suggests that human freedom is essential to identify the individuals' capacities to perform a task, regardless of sex or class; he emphasizes that limiting the scope of any occupation or activity arbitrarily based on sex or race is unjust and harmful to society.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage 2, the author discusses how the principle of equality has become the basis of human relations over the last few generations, but gender roles have been the slowest to change. The author believes that men and women should have access to all occupations without regard to gender. 
A: While it may be true that formal organization of society has been based on gender roles in the past, this is not mentioned in Passage 2 as a reason why gender roles are resistant to change.
B: This aligns with the idea expressed by the author that gender roles are resistant to change because of their association with powerful emotions that have become a part of tradition.
C: The author does not mention legislative reforms directly as a factor in the resistance to change among gender roles.
D: While other passages by Mill suggest that institutions may benefit from the status quo, the author does not make this argument in Passage 2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is discussing gender inequality and its effects on society.
  The author argues that inequality between men and women is one of the last legacies of the old order of society.
  The author argues that complete liberty of choice is the key to determining the appropriate sphere for each individual.
  A: This choice is not supported in the passage.
  B: The author does suggest that gender roles are entrenched in society, but this is not the strongest suggestion in the passage.
  C: The author doesn't outright suggest this and indeed argues that complete liberty of choice is needed.
  D: The author suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because they have become associated with strong emotions and intimate personal relationships.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses how society used to be based on inequality, and how things are changing to create a more just and equal society.
  The passage explains that the idea of equal rights for all has taken hold in society.
  The passage then focuses on the relationship between men and women and how it is lagging behind in terms of adapting to equal rights.
  Mill suggests that the reason for this resistance is due to the strong emotions and traditions connected to this relationship.
  The passage also argues that individuals should have full liberty of choice to pursue the occupations or roles they are best suited for, regardless of gender.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage 2, Mill argues that the general principle of human relations should be a just equality instead of the dominion of the strongest. However, the relationship between men and women is still deeply rooted in the old rule of inequality. Mill explains that the relationship between men and women has not changed because there is a strong emotional connection and men and women have not had the complete liberty of choice to decide their proper sphere. 
  A: In Passage 2, although Mill argues that society was previously constituted on the basis of inequality, he does not specifically mention that gender roles were its very basis.
  B: In Passage 2, Mill argues that gender roles are slow to change because they are associated with strong emotions and are connected to a lot of human interactions.
  C: In Passage 2, Mill does not suggest that gender roles are resistant to change because legislative reforms can only influence them indirectly.
  D: In Passage 2, Mill does not suggest that gender roles benefit the groups and institutions currently in power.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  In Passage 2, Mill discusses how society is transitioning from a state where inequality was its basis to one where association is grounded in equal rights. The relation between men and women is the last to transition from the old rule of inequality to the new one of just equality. This is because the relation between men and women is the nearest and most intimate and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, which makes it the most resistant to change. The passage suggests that each individual should be allowed to prove their capacities in any occupation they want through trial so that the world can benefit from the best faculties of all its inhabitants. Interfering beforehand and declaring that an individual's faculties shall not be exerted is an injustice to the individual and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses how society used to be based on inequality until the introduction of equal rights. It argues that the relationship between men and women has been the slowest to change due to attachments people have to old traditions.
  A: The passage does not suggest that gender roles are resistant to change because they served as the basis for the formal organization of society.
  B: In Passage 2, Mill most strongly suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because of deeply entrenched traditions.
  C: While the passage does touch on the subject of legislative reforms, it does not suggest that gender roles are resistant to change because of indirect influence from legislative reforms.
  D: The passage does not suggest that gender roles are resistant to change because they benefit the groups and institutions currently in power.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,.but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the.doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that’s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they’d never go.below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,” he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green’s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent. Adding another could make.efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which.would cut in half the number of solar panels needed.for a given installation. The challenge is to produce.good connections between these semiconductors,.something made challenging by the arrangement of.silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

Topic: English
Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden  with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are 5 the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the10 procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those15 doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty20 years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that25 makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively30 no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us35 then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old40 family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so 45 long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The0 questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that55 procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will60 object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men65 have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our70 brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the75 gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this "civilization" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in80 them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

Question: Do the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections?
Choices:
  A: Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.
  B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  C: No, because the data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder.
  D: No, because the data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The text mentions that honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and that these mites can increase the bees' susceptibility to secondary infection with other pathogens.
  The table presents data on the occurrence of several pathogenic agents in honey bee colonies, with and without colony collapse disorder.

Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  The data in the table do provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections. Specifically, for each pathogen listed in the table, the percentage of colonies infected with that pathogen is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for those without colony collapse disorder. This suggests that the mite infestation may lead to secondary infections with these pathogens, which in turn could contribute to colony collapse disorder. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- Varroa mites feed on bee hemolymph and can kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
- The table shows the percent of colonies affected by various pathogens.

Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The data in the table provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder. Since colony collapse disorder has been linked to varroa mite infestation, this suggests that the mite infestation increases the likelihood of secondary infections. Therefore, choice B is the best answer. Choice A is incorrect because the data do not indicate that a particular pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder. Choice C is incorrect because the data mention fungal infections as a cause of colony collapse disorder, but this is not relevant to the question of whether varroa mite infestation increases susceptibility to secondary infections. Choice D is incorrect because the context of the passage states that honeybees are hosts to Varroa mites, and the table provides information about pathogen occurrence in honey bee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder, suggesting that the honeybees had mite infestations.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses that Varroa mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria, or viruses. 
  The table shows the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together for colonies with colony collapse disorder and for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  
  A: The table shows the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together for colonies with colony collapse disorder and for colonies without colony collapse disorder. However, it does not indicate that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder. It only shows that the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  B: The percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder for each pathogen. This is consistent with the claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections. 
  C: The data actually provides evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder, but it is not relevant to the question of whether infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections. 
  D: The passage discusses that honey bees can be infected with Varroa mites and the mites increase their susceptibility to secondary infection. However, the data in the table do not specifically indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: Varroa mites feed on bee hemolymph and can kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. The excerpt mentions that "Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control." The table shows the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together, where colonies are categorized as either having or not having colony collapse disorder.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: The data indicate that colonies with colony collapse disorder had a greater percent of colonies infected by each pathogen than colonies without colony collapse disorder. This provides support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections. Choice A is incorrect because not all of the colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by the four pathogens. Choice C is incorrect because the data do provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder. Choice D is incorrect because the data indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.

  The text explains that Varroa mites can increase honeybees' susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
  The table shows the percent of honeybee colonies infected by different pathogens, with and without colony collapse disorder (CCD).
  A: The data do not provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo CCD. CCD may have multiple causes, and the table does not provide information about the cause of CCD.
  B: The data indicate that for viruses and IAPV, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with CCD than for colonies without CCD. For KBV, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with CCD, but not as much as for viruses and IAPV. For Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae, all the colonies with CCD, but none of the colonies without CCD, were infected. The table does not provide information about the effect of Varroa mites on secondary infection.
  C: The data provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of CCD, but this is not relevant to the authors' claim about Varroa mites.
  D: The data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses how varroa mites can increase the susceptibility of honeybees to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria, or viruses through feeding on their hemolymph. 
  The table shows the percent of honeybee colonies affected by certain pathogens with and without colony collapse disorder. 
A. The data in the table show evidence of a correlation between the presence of certain pathogens and colony collapse disorder, but they do not specifically demonstrate that varroa mites are the cause of this correlation.
B. The table does show a higher percentage of colonies infected with certain pathogens for colonies with colony collapse disorder compared to those without it, but this alone does not support the claim about varroa mites.
C. The data actually do provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder, with 83% of collapsed colonies being infected with viruses, some of which can be secondary infections of bacterial origin.
D. The data do not explicitly indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage suggests that Varroa mites can kill honeybees directly or by increasing their susceptibility to secondary infection. The table provides information about colonies with and without colony collapse disorder and the percent of colonies having honeybees infected by different pathogens, including viruses and fungi, but it does not provide information about Varroa mites.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes that Varroa mites can increase the susceptibility of honeybees to secondary infections and the data in the table are related to the occurrence of different pathogens in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
A: The data provide evidence that colonies with colony collapse disorder are infected with a pathogen, but there is no indication that this pathogen caused the colony collapse disorder. Also, the question is not about whether colony collapse disorder is caused by an infection.
B: The data suggest an association between colonies with colony collapse disorder and the occurrence of the pathogens listed in the table but do not directly indicate that infection with varroa mites increases susceptibility to secondary infections. 
C: The data do not relate to bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder. Also, the question is not about whether bacteria cause colony collapse disorder.
D: There is no data in the table about whether honeybees were infected with mites, but the text indicates that Varroa mites can increase the susceptibility of honeybees to secondary infections.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that Varroa mites can increase honeybees' susceptibility to secondary infections.
  The table shows the percent of colonies with honeybees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together for colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
A: The table shows that there is a higher percentage of colonies with virus infections (such as IAPV and KBV) for colonies with colony collapse disorder, but there is no evidence that these virus infections directly caused the collapse of the colonies. Moreover, there is no information on whether these colonies were also infected with mites.
B: Correct. The table shows that for each pathogen, the percentage of colonies with honeybees infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder. This suggests that the presence of one or more of these pathogens is related to the collapse of the colonies, which is consistent with the idea that mite infections increase the honeybees' susceptibility to secondary infections with other pathogens.
C: The table contains information on bacteria, but this choice is incorrect because it is not relevant to the question being asked.
D: Incorrect, the data in the table do indicate that honeybees in the colonies were infected with pathogens, but not whether they were infected with mites specifically.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The text explains that honeybees are hosts to Varroa destructor, a pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite. 
  Varroa mites feed on bee hemolymph and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria, or viruses.
  The text states "Without, at least, intermittent feeding on the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees."
  The table shows the percentage of colonies affected by viruses and fungi that cause colony collapse disorder for colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.

Analysis: 
The question asks whether the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections. The text describes how Varroa mite infections can make bees more susceptible to secondary infections, but the table only provides data on viruses and fungi that cause colony collapse disorder. Therefore, we need to determine whether the percentage of colonies affected by viruses and fungi differs between the colonies with and without colony collapse disorder, to see if there is evidence that a mite infection may exacerbate the effects of these pathogens.

Action: Answer("B")  
Choice B is correct because the data show that for each pathogen, the percentage of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder. If infection with varroa mites makes bees more susceptible to secondary infections, we would expect to see a higher percentage of colonies with varroa mite infestations affected by viruses and fungi that cause colony collapse disorder. Therefore, the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim. Choice A is incorrect because the table does not show that the pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder. Choice C is incorrect because the text does mention bacteria, and because the data in the table do not differentiate between the causes of colony collapse disorder. Choice D is incorrect because the text establishes that varroa mites infect honeybees and that this increases the bees' susceptibility to secondary infections, so it is unnecessary for the table to indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.

Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.
Question: The author of Passage 2 would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims
Choices:
  A: only apply to certain subspecies of tigers and are therefore inconclusive.
  B: will offer incentive for countries and regions to invest further in wildlife preservation programs.
  C: prove that rigorous efforts to protect endangered species result in quick recovery of populations.
  D: may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1: Talks about a new report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) suggesting that the number of tigers living in the wild may have increased in the last several years. A study compiling surveys taken across Asia, found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. However, wild tigers are elusive, and their habitats have become tiny and scattered during the last century, which makes them difficult to track. Furthermore, although global numbers seem to have gone up, a country-by-country analysis is more sobering, as some countries have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2: The author argues that scientific progress is essential to saving endangered species and that there are more rigorous methods than the outdated methods that lead to flawed methodologies.
Action: Answer("D") 
The author states in Passage 2 that "their tally, based on official estimates, relied on flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor. And their goal for population growth far exceeds what one would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried out using more rigorous techniques". The author claims that speculative tiger numbers undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be our top priority: guarding and growing the source populations, and notes that only with reliable counts can we set realistic goals for future growth, develop suitable strategies for meeting those goals, and measure the impact of our conservation efforts. Thus, the author is advocating for cautious optimism since populations of tigers are still at risk. Therefore, Answer("D") may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 reports a new study suggesting that the number of tigers living in the wild might be increasing, following years of conservationist effort.
  In Passage 2, the author criticizes the methods used to determine tiger populations, as well as the questionable reliability of the global wild tiger count. The author stresses the importance of using sound science and rigorous methods in conservation practices.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 reports that a new study by the World Wildlife Fund suggests that tiger populations may be on the rise, which is a positive trend. However, tracking wild tigers is challenging since they have elusive habits and their habitats have become small and scattered. Passage 2 discusses the difficulties in estimating tiger numbers and range using scientific methods, and argues that there is a need for vigilance, sound science, and a focus on analyzing source populations to save the species. Passage 2 also cites flaws and limitations in the methodologies and goals of some conservation agencies.

Action: Answer("D")  
The author of Passage 2 would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection. The author of Passage 2 emphasizes the need for reliable counts and source population monitoring, and cautions against relying on speculative numbers or outdated tools in the conservation of tigers. The author also suggests that the goal of increasing tiger populations to 6,000 by 2022 may be unrealistic, and highlights the losses in viable tiger populations in some countries. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 reports a study by the WWF suggesting that the number of wild tigers may have increased over the last several years. If this is confirmed, it would mark the first time in more than a century that tiger populations have grown. However, tracking wild tigers is notoriously difficult and some countries have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 argues that the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, but its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not been sufficient. Officials' reliance on outdated tools can lead to flawed estimates and undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting attention from the need to monitor viable source populations.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 reports the findings of a new study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) suggesting that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising. If continued surveys prove this to be true, this would mark the first time in more than a century that tiger populations have grown.
  Passage 2 criticizes the adoption of outdated tools for tiger population assessment, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of animal droppings.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a new study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) suggesting increasing tiger populations in the wild due to successful conservation programs.
  Passage 2 describes the limitations of tiger population assessment methods and criticizes the extrapolation from flawed methodologies.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 reports a study by the World Wildlife Fund that suggests the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years.
  Passage 2 discusses the science of tiger population assessment and the use of methodologies to estimate tiger numbers, suggesting that current methods are flawed and often omit reliable data from certain countries.

Action: Answer("D")  
The author of Passage 2 would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when, in fact, they continue to require vigilant protection. Passage 2 emphasizes that the current methodologies used to estimate tiger populations are flawed and do not provide reliable counts of tiger populations across Asia, and that only with reliable counts can we set realistic goals for future growth, measure the impact of conservation efforts, and monitor viable tiger populations. Therefore, the author of Passage 2 stresses the need for ongoing conservation efforts and vigilant protection of tigers despite the possible increase reported in the study by the World Wildlife Fund.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a study indicating a possible rise in the number of wild tigers.
  The author of Passage 2 criticizes some methods used by organizations such as WWF to estimate tiger populations, and argues that more rigorous, science-based methods are necessary to ensure the proper protection and preservation of wild tiger populations. The author also notes that some countries and regions have seen tiger populations decline.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: The author of Passage 2 criticizes the methods used to estimate tiger populations and the notion of relying on speculative tiger numbers. The author asserts that the focus should be on source populations and reliable counts to measure the impact of conservation efforts. 

A: The author of Passage 2 does not mention subspecies of tigers and does not raise concerns about the inconclusive nature of the conclusions made in Passage 1 for any particular tigers subspecies. 
B: The author of Passage 2 criticizes the use of flawed methods which produce speculative tiger numbers and instead proposes the use of reliable counts to set realistic goals and measure impact. 
C: The author of Passage 2 does not make such a claim. Rather the author focuses on the need for reliable population assessments and avoiding speculative tiger numbers. 
D: The author of Passage 2 seems to support this assertion as a concern, noting that even though official estimates indicate increased tiger populations, there may be no convincing data supporting a recovery trend in many areas. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 reports on a study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) which suggests that the tiger populations may have grown slowly over the last several years and that if continued surveys prove this to be true, this would mark the first time in over a century that tiger populations have grown.

Topic: English
Context: Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,.but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the.doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that’s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they’d never go.below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,” he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green’s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent. Adding another could make.efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which.would cut in half the number of solar panels needed.for a given installation. The challenge is to produce.good connections between these semiconductors,.something made challenging by the arrangement of.silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her50 reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an55 orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....Consider, sir, dispassionately, these60 observations-for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, "that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it65 was impossible to explain." If so, on what does your constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this70 country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman-prescription.Consider-I address you as a legislatorwhether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their75 own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift 80 of reason?In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be 85 useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?
Question: The authors of both passages would most likely agree with which of the following statements about women in the eighteenth century?
Choices:
  A: Their natural preferences were the same as those of men.
  B: They needed a good education to be successful in society.
  C: They were just as happy in life as men were.
  D: They generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues against women's participation in government by appealing to their supposedly delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations and duties of motherhood. It also suggests that the exclusion of women from public employment is necessary for the happiness of both sexes.
  Passage 2 argues that women require education in order to become successful in society and contribute to the progress of knowledge and virtue. It also criticizes the idea that women should be denied civil and political rights.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passages talk about the lack of political representation and equal rights for women which suggests that women had fewer rights than men during the time the passages were written. 
  Passage 1 also argues that the "delicate constitutions" and "peaceful inclinations" of women were better suited for "gentle occupations and the cares of the home." This argument implies that the natural preferences of women were seen as different from those of men.
  Passage 2 argues that women needed education to be successful and contribute to society. It also challenges the idea of denying women equal rights on the basis that women have the same ability to reason as men.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 argues against women’s participation in politics, claiming that it is not in women’s interest to aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. It asserts that women are different from men in their inclinations, duties, and capabilities. Therefore, it concludes that women and men have different roles and that they should not compete in life. 
  Passage 2 argues for women’s participation in politics, claiming that if women are not prepared by education to become the companion of man, they will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue. The author states that truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. The author further suggests that women are capable of understanding patriotism and moral and civil interests of mankind; and that women’s education and situation at present shut her out from such investigations.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Both passages are written by authors who advocate for women's rights.
  Passage 1 argues that women should not have political rights or functions and that their interests are best served by focusing on domestic and gentle occupations.
  Passage 2 argues that women need education to become the companions of men, to understand patriotism, and to be virtuous.
  A: Neither passage discusses whether women's natural preferences were similar or different from those of men.
  B: Passage 2 argues that women need education to succeed, while Passage 1 suggests that their interests lie in domestic activities.
  C: Neither passage makes any claim about the level of happiness experienced by women relative to that of men.
  D: Both passages suggest that women enjoyed fewer rights than men did during the eighteenth century.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues against women having political rights based on the belief that their interests are best served by not having them.
  Passage 2 argues in favor of women having political and civil rights, believing that women's education and participation in society would help progress knowledge and virtue.
  A: Neither passage directly addresses whether women's natural preferences were the same as those of men in the eighteenth century.
  B: Passage 2 directly argues the importance of education for women in order to progress knowledge and virtue.
  C: Neither passage directly addresses whether women were just as happy in life as men were in the eighteenth century.
  D: Both passages suggest that, in the eighteenth century, women generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did. Passages 1 and 2 argue about women's political and civil rights, respectively.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 is arguing that women should not aspire to political rights and functions, and that doing so would interfere with the common happiness of society.
  Passage 2 is arguing that women need education and freedom to be virtuous and useful to society and that denying them equal rights is unjust.

Action: Answer("D")  
The authors of both passages would most likely agree with statement D, that women generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.
Question: Which statement about striped cucumber beetles can most reasonably be inferred from the passage?
Choices:
  A: They feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
  B: They are less attracted to dimethoxybenzene than honey bees are.
  C: They experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease.
  D: They are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study on Texas gourd plants and their pollinators, including squash bees and honey bees.
  Striped cucumber beetles can be harmful to Texas gourd plants, chewing up pollen and petals, defecating in flowers, and transmitting bacterial wilt disease.
  The study aimed to find out if increasing the scent of the Texas gourd flowers would attract more pollinators or more cucumber beetles.

Action: Answer("D")
The passage states that striped cucumber beetles are very harmful to Texas gourd plants, as they chew up pollen and petals, defecate in flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease. It also mentions that the floral scent of Texas gourd plants attracts bees and the beetles, but the scent compound that specifically lures squash bees into traps is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene. Therefore, the most reasonable inference is that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that attracts squash bees. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage is discussing a study on Texas gourd plants, their fragrance, pollinators, and beetles. 
  Striped cucumber beetles are among the bad guys that chew up pollen and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  The Texas gourd plant's main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees
  The floral scent of the Texas gourd plant includes 10 compounds, and 1,4-dimethoxybenzene is the most abundant compound that lures squash bees.
  The scent of the Texas gourd plant can also attract striped cucumber beetles, which is detrimental to the plant.
Action: Answer("D")  
The statement that can most reasonably be inferred from the passage is that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are. The passage states "The Texas gourd vine’s main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene… extra scent could well call in more beetles, too." This implies that striped cucumber beetles can also be attracted to the compound 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, which is part of the floral scent of the Texas gourd plant.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the interactions between Texas gourd plants, pollinators (honey bees and squash bees), and striped cucumber beetles.
  The scent of Texas gourd plants includes 10 compounds, and the most abundant compound, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, lures squash bees into traps.
  The researchers tested whether increasing the fragrance of Texas gourd flowers attracted more pollinators but also attracted more beetles.
  The researchers found that increasing the fragrance of Texas gourd flowers did not attract more pollinators, but it did attract more beetles. Beetles can damage flowers and reduce the overall seed set of the plants.

A: They feed primarily on Texas gourd plants. - There is no information in the passage about the primary food source or diet of striped cucumber beetles.
B: They are less attracted to dimethoxybenzene than honey bees are. - The passage states that dimethoxybenzene is the compound in Texas gourd scent that lures squash bees into traps. There is no information about whether striped cucumber beetles are more or less attracted to it than honey bees.
C: They experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease. - The passage states that striped cucumber beetles transmit the bacterial wilt disease, which can quickly kill entire Texas gourd plants. There is no information to suggest that the negative effects of carrying the disease are minor.
D: They are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are. - The passage does not explicitly state whether striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the compound (1,4-dimethoxybenzene) in Texas gourd scent that attracts squash bees. However, the passage does mention that beetles chew up pollen and petals and defecate in the flowers, which can damage the flowers and reduce the overall seed set of Texas gourd plants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants because they chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  The passage also describes the specific problem of the Texas gourd plant attracting enough pollinators but not too many beetles.
  The researchers found that beetles were more attracted to highly fragrant flowers and that pollinators were not more attracted to highly fragrant flowers.
Action: Answer("D")  
The statement that can most reasonably be inferred from the passage about striped cucumber beetles is that they are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Striped cucumber beetles are harmful to Texas gourd plants, as they damage flowers and transmit bacterial wilt disease. 
  The main pollinators of Texas gourd plants are honey bees and squash bees, both of which respond to the floral scent that includes 10 compounds, and the most abundant one that attracts only squash bees is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
  Nina Theis and Lynn Adler conducted a study to find out how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles and concluded that extra scent could call more beetles and repel bees.
Action: Answer("D") 
The statement that most reasonably can be inferred from the passage about striped cucumber beetles is that they are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are, which is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as bad guys for Texas gourd plants, as they chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease, which can rapidly kill the plant. The study examines how to attract enough pollinators without attracting too many beetles.
 
A: The passage does not suggest that striped cucumber beetles exclusively feed on Texas gourd plants, so this statement cannot be reasonably inferred.
B: There is no information in the passage about the attraction of striped cucumber beetles to dimethoxybenzene compared to honey bees, so this statement cannot be reasonably inferred.
C: The passage describes the transmission of bacterial wilt disease as a serious threat to Texas gourd plants, so this statement is not reasonable.
D: The passage states that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the scent of Texas gourd plants and transmit bacterial wilt disease that can cause severe damage, and it describes compounds, such as 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, that attract specialized squash bees. Therefore, we can infer that the striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent as squash bees are.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Texas gourd plant and its pollinators and predators.
  Striped cucumber beetles are a type of predator that attack the Texas gourd plant, chew up pollen and petals, and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  The scent of the Texas gourd plant includes 10 compounds, with 1,4-dimethoxybenzene being the main compound that attracts squash bees.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses striped cucumber beetles in relation to the Texas gourd plant and its pollinators.
  A: The passage states that striped cucumber beetles are "very bad guys" for the Texas gourd plant because they chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  B: The passage does not provide any information about the specific attraction of striped cucumber beetles to dimethoxybenzene.
  C: The passage does not suggest that striped cucumber beetles experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease. Rather, the passage describes bacterial wilt disease as a "dreaded" infection that can quickly damage an entire plant.
  D: The passage states that the compound that lures squash bees into traps, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, is the most abundant of the 10 compounds in the Texas gourd scent and that this scent was specifically tested in an experiment with fragrance-enhanced plants and beetles. However, the passage does not explicitly state that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to this compound.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how striped cucumber beetles are among the bad guys for a Texas gourd plant because they damage the flowers, chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  The passage also describes an experiment aimed at testing whether extra floral scent (specifically, dimethoxybenzene) attracts more pollinators and/or more beetles to Texas gourd flowers.
  
  A: The passage does not provide evidence that striped cucumber beetles feed primarily on Texas gourd plants. This choice is not reasonable because there is no evidence that beetles have a diet restricted only to Texas gourd plants.
  B: The passage does not provide evidence related to whether striped cucumber beetles are less attracted to dimethoxybenzene than honey bees. This choice is not supported by the information provided in the passage.
  C: The passage specifically states that bacterial wilt disease is a dreaded infection that can reduce an entire Texas gourd plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in mere days. Therefore, this statement is not reasonable based on the passage.
  D: The passage specifically indicates that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to Texas gourd scent, but it does not specify whether they are attracted to the same compound (dimethoxybenzene) that squash bees are attracted to. Although this choice is not explicitly stated, it is the most reasonable inference from the information provided in the passage.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the negative impact of striped cucumber beetles on Texas gourd plants.
  The researchers wanted to test whether extra scent would attract more beetles.
  The researchers found that hand-pollinated flowers from fragrance-enhanced plants had reduced pollination and less reproduction.
  It can be inferred from the passage that beetles damage flowers directly, regardless of whether they repel pollinators or not.

Action: Answer("D") 
The passage states that "For a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers...". There is no information suggesting that striped cucumber beetles feed primarily on Texas gourd plants (A) or that they experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease (C). The passage does not provide any evidence or comparison of beetles' attraction to dimethoxybenzene versus honey bees (B). However, it is mentioned in the passage that the compound in Texas gourd scent that lures squash bees is the most abundant and is also the one that makes trap beetles. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are (D).

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls and tables for four  down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass 10 sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other15 page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears.While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed 20 on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of25 Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important assembly ever convoked to discuss and 30 determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and 35 began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his right thumb) presided over the Congress, and40 Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented France.A party of four, two men and two women, came into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took possession of the center table nearest Lymie.45 The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against 50 the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup and shrimp 55 cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went back. 60 Otherwise he might never have known about the secret treaty concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress65 were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68 , but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair. Lymie closed the book and said, "I didn't think you 70 were coming."Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his75 scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button.80 Apparently he himself was not aware that there had been any change. He straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth85 finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of 90 the moon. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five.

Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

Knowledge: 
  In the given context, Parsons argues that political parties cannot be trusted with the management of social and industrial affairs because they tend to abuse power once they have it.
  A: Parsons expresses her concern that men will abuse power when they possess it, but she does not state that this is because human nature is too easily corrupted by power. Also, this answer choice is a general statement about human nature and corruption, rather than a specific argument about political parties.
  B: Parsons does not mention parties making deals with opposing parties as a way to consolidate power.
  C: While Parsons does argue that political parties often sacrifice their own ideals for pragmatic actions, this is not the argument she uses to support her claim about the extent to which political parties can be trusted by voters.
  D: Parsons does not mention political parties advancing positions that are at odds with the beliefs of many of their members.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The author is discussing why she turned from political socialism to anarchism. She argues that governments cannot be trusted to alleviate the sufferings of the working class. She believes that once a party is in power it will do whatever is necessary to remain in power, even if that means suppressing the voice of the people. Therefore, she believes that entrusting control of all social and industrial affairs to a political party is a dangerous prospect.
A: The author argues that men will abuse power when they possess it. She does not make a claim about human nature generally being too easily corrupted by power.
B: While the author argues that parties might consolidate power, she does not make a claim about them making deals with opposing parties.
C: The author does not argue that political parties always sacrifice their own ideals. Rather, she suggests that parties in power will do whatever is necessary to remain there.
D: The author does not claim that parties typically advance positions that are at odds with the beliefs of many of their members.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Parsons argues that governments use their concentrated power to silence the voice of discontent and advance the interests of the few. 
  In her close study, she realized that political parties vying for power tend to make promises to secure voters’ confidence, but these promises usually cannot be relied upon since parties, when they hold power, focus on retaining it by silencing dissenting voices.
  She concludes that political parties cannot be trusted with the management of societal affairs because power corrupts individuals and men have abused power when they possessed it throughout history.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Parsons does not trust political parties with the management of our social and industrial affairs, and she does not believe they can be trusted with all the authority to dictate the kind of books being used in our schools and universities and all the activities of life that people engage in, in a civilized society. 
A: This answer choice is partially correct. Parsons acknowledges that they are "human with all the human attributes of the politician" and tend to remain in power at all hazards, build up a powerful machine to crush opposition, and silence the voice of the minority. However, she does not claim that political parties are inherently corrupt because human nature is too easily corrupted by power. 
B: There is no mention of parties consolidating power by making deals with opposing parties in the given context. 
C: Parsons does not say that political parties always sacrifice their own ideals for pragmatic actions. 
D: There is no mention of parties advancing positions that are at odds with the beliefs of many of their members. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Parsons is arguing against trusting political parties with the management of social and industrial affairs.
  She contends that organized governments tend to use their concentrated power to silence the voice of discontent and retard progress by serving the few at the expense of the many. 
  Her close study of the origin, history and tendency of governments showed that governments never lead; they follow progress.
  She believes that a political party in power might do anything to crush opposition and silence the voice of the minority.
  She turned from political socialism to anarchism because in its philosophy she believes she can find the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society.
  
  A: Parsons does discuss how human nature can lead politicians to abuse power, but this is not the argument she uses to support her claim about the trustworthiness of political parties.
  B: Parsons does not mention deals between opposing parties in regards to the trustworthiness of political parties.
  C: Parsons does mention that political parties make fair promises out of power to secure the people's confidence, but once in power, they only aim to remain in power and might crush opposition and silence the voice of the minority. This answer choice is somewhat close to this point. 
  D: The argument in this choice is not relevant to the question about the trustworthiness of political parties.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author believes that governments, as the concentrated power in society, have tendencies to use their power to silence the voice of dissent, to retard progress and to serve the interests of the few. 
  She also contends that political parties in power become desperate to remain in power and to build up a powerful machine to keep control and crush all opposition including the "murmurs of discontent" of the minority.
  Her conclusion is that entrusting a political party with all authority to dictate all the details that make up the sum total of our lives is not desirable because men will abuse power when in possession of it.

Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.
Question: According to Passage 2, the wild tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed as a result of which factor?
Choices:
  A: Generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete
  B: Limitation to data that are more relevant in certain countries than in others
  C: Reliance on a new experimental tool that has not been thoroughly tested in the field
  D: Assumption of stability in population growth over time that is not supported by data
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses the limitations of the tiger population estimates provided by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum, which were based on outdated methodologies and flawed statistical extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor. While the science of tiger population assessment has progressed, its adoption by governmental and non-governmental conservation agencies is limited due to a lack of understanding or comfort with the new methods or because the old methods cast a more flattering light on their efforts. The goal for population growth far exceeds what one would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried out using more rigorous techniques. There are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia, and countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years - losses masked by any single global tiger number.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses the scientific methods used to estimate tiger populations and argues that the adoption of these methods has been slow in conservation agencies. The author also questions the wild tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum, stating that it relied on flawed methodologies and that the increase in tiger populations may only reflect better surveying methods.

A: Passage 2 does not suggest that the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum made generalizations from incomplete evidence, but rather that their estimates relied on flawed methodologies.

B: Passage 2 does not argue that the data used to estimate tiger populations are more relevant in certain countries than in others, but rather that the adoption of new scientific methods has been slow in conservation agencies.

C: Passage 2 does not indicate that the flawed methodologies used for tiger population estimates were based on a new experimental tool that has not been thoroughly tested in the field.

D: The answer is D. According to the passage, the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum relied on flawed methodologies that assumed population growth over time, which may not be supported by data. The author argues that reliable population counts using the best available science are necessary to set realistic goals for future growth and to measure the impact of conservation efforts.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: Passage 2 explains that the methodology used to estimate the number of wild tigers by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed. They relied on the use of unreliable methodologies and assumed that populations are stable, which is not supported by data. They did not use scientifically accepted techniques to provide an accurate count.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 criticizes the reliance on outdated tools for estimating tiger populations.
  Although some new methods, such as photographic capture-recapture and occupancy modeling, have been developed to estimate tiger numbers, their adoption by conservation agencies has been slow.
  The WWF and the Global Tiger Forum announced that the global tiger population was on the rise based on official estimates, but the estimate may be unreliable due to flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 talks about the method used to estimate the tiger population by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum. According to the passage, the reliance on outdated methodologies, including statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor, has resulted in a flawed estimate of tiger populations. The goal for population growth that is far beyond what one would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried out using more rigorous techniques also cast a more flattering light on their efforts. Furthermore, there are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia, and countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years, losses masked by any single global tiger number.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 critiques the tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum mentioned in Passage 1.
  According to Passage 2, the estimate relies on flawed methodologies, including statistics based on tiger photographs and field counts, which are considered statistically weak.
  The goal of increasing tiger populations to 6,000 by 2022 is also criticized as exceeding what would be expected based on studies carried out using more rigorous techniques.
  Loss of tiger populations in certain countries and regions (e.g. Cambodia, Vietnam, and China) is mentioned as masking losses in the overall count of wild tigers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 explains that photographic capture-recapture and large-scale occupancy modeling are currently used to estimate tiger numbers and range. However, not all governmental and non-governmental conservation agencies adopt these new techniques. Their reluctance may be due to a lack of understanding of the new methods, or to the fact that they are comfortable with outdated tools. Passage 2 also suggests that the tiger population estimates offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed, due to the use of methodology such as extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor.
A: Generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete is an inappropriate answer, as it is not mentioned in the passage.
B: Limitation to data that are more relevant in certain countries than in others is not the main factor that may have caused the flawed tiger population estimate. Instead, the passage explains that reliance on outdated methodologies, such as extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor, might have caused the flaw.
C: Reliance on a new experimental tool that has not been thoroughly tested in the field is an incorrect answer, as it is not mentioned in the passage. 
D: Assumption of stability in population growth over time that is not supported by data is an incorrect answer. The passage does not talk about the assumption of stability in population growth. The passage explains that the tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed, due to the use of methodology such as extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: Passage 2 explains that while the science of tiger population assessment has progressed rapidly, its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not, possibly because of a lack of understanding or comfort with the new methods or because the old methods cast a more flattering light on their efforts. The passage also indicates that the estimation of tiger population may be flawed based on limited data and using statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor. 
Action: Answer("A") The wild tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed as a result of generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete.
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses the population assessment of wild tigers and points out that the adoption of new scientific methods has not progressed as rapidly as it should have, and some conservation agencies still rely on old and flawed methodologies. It mentions that the recent estimate of wild tiger populations provided by WWF and Global Tiger Forum relied on flawed methodologies.

A: This answer choice refers to a selection bias, which is not mentioned as a contribution to flawed tiger population estimate in Passage 2.
B: This answer choice refers to regional preferences, which is also not mentioned to cause the tiger population estimate to be flawed in Passage 2.
C: This answer choice is inaccurate as Passage 2 does not suggest that a new experimental tool caused errors in the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum's estimations of tiger populations.
D: This answer choice accurately reflects the reason why the tiger population estimate offered by WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses a recent estimate of the world's wild tiger population made by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum.
  The estimate concluded that the tiger population was on the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals, and it aimed to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022.
  However, Passage 2 believes that this estimate may be flawed.
  The reason for this flaw is due to the use of flawed methodologies including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor.
  And their goal for population growth far exceeds what one would expect to realize from studies carried out using more rigorous techniques.
  Furthermore, except for a few reserves in India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the  labyrinthine streets of London might have oncabbies' brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to beinvolved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies-a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The moreyears a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.The brain is a mutable organ, capable-within limits-of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known asneuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structurewas more or less static. Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.After her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with ElizabethValentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the Londoncabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners  and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical 45 differences in the brains of the memory champs, evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural50 difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. What's more, on every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes' scores came back well within the normal range. The 55 memory champs weren't smarter, and they didn't have special brains.But there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the researchers looked at which parts of the 60 brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry. According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be 65 working in overdrive for the mental athletes.Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial70 navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn't seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in 75 their mind's eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating like London cabbies when they're supposed to be remembering the shapes of snowflakes?Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes 80 to describe exactly what was going through their minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said they were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial85 journeys. They weren't doing this automatically, or because it was an inborn talent they'd nurtured since childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural activity that Maguire's fMRIs turned up were the result of training and practice

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Choices:
  A: general discussion of the narrator's love of reading to a portrayal of an influential incident.
  B: depiction of the narrator's father to an examination of an author with whom the narrator becomes enchanted.
  C: symbolic representation of a skill the narrator possesses to an example of its application.
  D: tale about the hardships of the narrator's childhood to an analysis of the effects of those hardships.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
The passage begins with a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading, but then shifts to a portrayal of an influential incident that occurs when the bookseller gives the narrator a copy of "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens. The focus of the passage then becomes an examination of the author and the impact his work has on the narrator. The depiction of the narrator's father is secondary to this focus. Therefore, the correct answer is B: depiction of the narrator's father to an examination of an author with whom the narrator becomes enchanted.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Knowledge:
  - The passage begins with the narrator's love of reading, but the main focus shifts to a specific incident involving a gift from the bookseller Sempere and a book by Charles Dickens.
  - The narrator's father is depicted in the passage, but the main focus is not on him.
  - While the narrator's love of reading is a recurring theme, there is a clear shift in focus to the gift of Great Expectations from Sempere.
  - The passage does touch on the narrator's difficult childhood, but the main focus is not on analyzing the effects of those hardships.
  - The main focus is not on a symbolic representation of a skill possessed by the narrator or its application.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The main focus of the passage shifts from the depiction of the narrator's father to an examination of Charles Dickens, an author with whom the narrator becomes enchanted. The latter half of the passage focuses on the narrator's love and appreciation for "Great Expectations" and how it affects him. The shift in the main focus starts with the sentence "My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana." and continues through the end of the passage. So, the best answer is B.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The majority of the passage actually focuses on the relationship between the narrator and his father, with the father's disapproval of the narrator's love for reading. However, the main focus of the passage shifts from the father to the narrator's discovery of Charles Dickens' book, "Great Expectations," which becomes an influential incident for the narrator. Therefore, choice B is the best answer.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: The main focus of the passage shifts from a depiction of the narrator's love of reading in general and his difficult relationship with his father to an examination of an author (Charles Dickens) with whom the narrator becomes enchanted after receiving a book from his favorite bookshop owner as a gift.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
The passage begins by stating that the narrator's friends as a child were books, and goes on to describe how he saw a world of light, streets, and people in words, and how he loved books, despite his father's objection. While the narrator's love of reading is a recurring theme throughout the passage, the main focus gradually shifts to the narrator becoming enchanted with an author, Charles Dickens, and a particular book (Great Expectations) that he reads numerous times due to the lack of other books on hand. The portrayal of the narrator's father is also prominent, but it ties into the central theme of the narrator's love of reading, as his father strongly objects to the presence of books in the house and threatens to send the narrator off to work at a young age. Therefore, the best answer is B, as the passage shifts from a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading to an examination of an author with whom the narrator becomes enchanted.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: The passage starts with a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading and how reading helped him see beyond his limited surroundings. However, the focus then shifts to an examination of the narrator's relationship with his father and the obstacles he faces in pursuing his passion for reading. Finally, the focus shifts once again to the narrator's encounter with the bookshop owner and his discovery of the author Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens becomes an influential figure for the narrator, and the passage ends with his desire to learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.
Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
The main focus of the passage shifts from a depiction of the narrator's father to an examination of an author with whom the narrator becomes enamored. The passage begins with a discussion of the narrator's love for reading, but this is not the main focus of the passage. Instead, the focus shifts to the narrator's father's disapproval of reading, which leads to the narrator's clandestine exploration of books. The narrator's encounter with the Sempere & Sons bookshop and his ensuing relationship with Mr. Dickens is an example of the application of the narrator's love of reading, but it is not the main focus of the passage.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
The passage starts with the narrator's love of reading, but as the passage goes on, it shifts to focus on the narrator's relationship with his father and the challenges he faces trying to read in his home. The portrayal of the narrator's father dominates before the passage shifts to an examination of the author (Charles Dickens) with whom the narrator becomes enchanted. Choice B is accurate in describing the main focus shift from the father to an author who delights the narrator.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: 
  The passage primarily focuses on the narrator's love of reading and how it influenced his life, including a pivotal incident where he receives a copy of "Great Expectations" from Sempere. However, the focus also shifts to depict the narrator's father and his resistance to books, as well as the narrator's fascination with words and their hidden science. Furthermore, the passage examines the author Charles Dickens and how his work inspired the narrator to pursue writing. While there are also depictions of the narrator's hardships, they serve to contextualize and explain his love of reading rather than as the primary focus of the passage. Therefore, the best answer is B.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Large competitors are often viewed as a major.threat for startups and small companies; big.companies have more financial resources and greater.scale, market power and brand awareness than.smaller ones. However, our research finds that a.smaller brand can actually benefit if consumers can.see the competitive threat it faces from a larger.organization..When a U.S.-based ice cream chain with about 1,400 stores moved within 50 steps of a J.P. Licks ice.cream store in Newton, Massachusetts, some people.expected that J.P. Licks, a small, locally owned.company, would be beaten out of the Newton market..But consumers rallied around J.P. Licks, and the.national chain later closed its nearby location. When.the owner of the Los Angeles-based coffee store chain.The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf could not stop a large.coffee shop chain from moving in next door, he was.surprised to see his sales shoot up—so much so that.he started proactively colocating new stores next to.large chain ones..These examples are not anomalies. In six lab and.field studies, we explored the effects of having a large,.dominant competitor and found that highlighting a.large competitor’s size and close proximity can help.smaller brands, instead of harming them. Compared.to when they are in competition with brands that are.similar to them in size or when consumers view them.outside of a competitive context, small brands see.consumer support go up when they are faced with a.competitive threat from large brands. This support.translates into higher purchase intention, more.purchases and more favorable online reviews..As part of our research, we conducted a field study.at an independent bookstore in Cambridge,.Massachusetts. Upon entering the bookstore, 163.prospective shoppers were exposed to one of three.versions of an in-store ad, emphasizing either the.store’s large competitors, small competitors or no.competition. Shoppers who read the “large.competitors” version were told that the store’s main.competitors are large corporations that have the.ability to put small businesses such as this bookstore.out of business. The “small competitors” version.indicated the store’s main competitors are other.locally owned small bookstores in Cambridge. In the.“no competition” version, participants were given no.information about the competitive environment..Shoppers were then given a $5 coupon, coded with.the in-store ad version they read. Analyzing.shoppers’ sales receipts and the number of redeemed.coupons, we found that shoppers were significantly.more likely to make a purchase after reading the.“large competitors” version of the in-store ad,.compared to the “small competitors” version or the.“no competition” version. They also purchased more.items and spent more money at the store, compared.to shoppers reading the “small competitors” or “no.competition” versions. These results suggest that.framing the competitive game and emphasizing a.competitive narrative against a larger company can.help a small establishment—and spur consumers to.make a purchase that supports the smaller.competitor..In subsequent studies, we tested this “framing-.the-game” effect in various contexts and product.categories and further found that support for a large.brand decreases when consumers view it as being in.competition with a smaller brand. In one study, we.asked participants to assess two hypothetical rival tire.shops, “Tire World” and “Tire Planet,” under three.conditions—small vs. large, small vs. small or large.vs. large competitors. While participants indicated no.preference for the small or large shop when it was.competing against a competitor of similar size, the.small vs. large competitive context elicited a strong.preference for the small rather than large shop.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together, to a house divided against itself, and says that it is  contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.When did he learn, and by what authority does he proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that "a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand." Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a "house divided against itself." They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
Question: 80 with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now. Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there has been agitation and resistance.... Do you think that the nature of man will be changed, that the same 85 causes that produced agitation at one time will not have the same effect at another? In the first paragraph of Passage 1, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States is to
Choices:
  A: provide context for Douglas's defense of continued expansion.
  B: suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
  C: imply that Lincoln is unaware of basic facts concerning the country.
  D: account for the image of the United States as powerful and admirable.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 both contain ideas related to the division of the United States between free and slave states. However, they offer different perspectives and opinions.
  Passage 1 is a response from Stephen Douglas to a question about the sustainability of a Union divided into Free and Slave States. He argues that the Union can exist indefinitely if each State carries out the principles upon which the Constitution was founded.
  Choice A is not a relevant interpretation of the paragraph because Passage 1 is not primarily about defending further expansion of the United States. 
  Choice B is a possible interpretation. Passage 1 suggests that the Union's division between Free and Slave States is not a threat to its existence, as long as each State controls its own affairs and the principles upon which the Constitution were founded are respected. 
  Choice C is incorrect because Passage 1 does not suggest that Lincoln is unaware of basic facts about the country. 
  Choice D is a potentially correct interpretation. The passage mentions that the United States has grown rapidly in population and power, and it is currently admired throughout the world. However, it is not the main purpose of the paragraph. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 is discussing a debate between Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln concerning the issue of slavery and its expansion in the United States.
  The first paragraph of Passage 1 discusses the growth of the United States in population, territory, wealth, and power.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. "They jumped up like popcorn," he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. "He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. "I asked 35 him how it went," Ken recalled, "and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' " Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the "aha" moment. "The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively," he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. "It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car," he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)
Question: Which statement best captures Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research?
Choices:
  A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
  B: The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior.
  C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest.
  D: Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial designed a research project to explore how baby game birds learned to fly.
  A: This answer choice is partially true but does not capture Ken Dial's central assumption. Ken Dial's discovery challenges the traditional dichotomy of the ground-up versus the tree-down theory for the origin of flight in birds.
  B: The passage provides no evidence to suggest that Ken Dial believes that erratic jumping is a recent evolved behavior. 
  C: This answer choice is incorrect. In fact, Ken Dial observed that all the species he watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: Ken Dial designed a project to investigate what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly. He settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species and observed that they preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. Young Terry Dial observed that the birds were cheating by using their legs to climb up the hay while flapping their half-formed wings. In response, Ken Dial realized that birds use their wings and legs cooperatively and came up with the technique of WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, which not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying. 

Action: Answer("A") 
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial designed a project to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly 
  Ground-dwelling bird species prefer to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling.
  The baby Chukars were using their wings and legs cooperatively to run up the textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. Ken called this movement wing-assisted incline running (WAIR).
  WAIR not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 3:
Knowledge: Ken Dial's research focused on observing the behavior of young Chukar Partridges and seeing how they learned to fly. He discovered a new technique called wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) which helped the birds climb vertical surfaces. This technique gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying.
A: The answer choice accurately describes important aspects of Ken Dial's research, but it doesn't best capture his central assumption.
B: Ken Dial's research did not focus on the evolutionary timeline of behavior. Additionally, the behavior of birds may not be considered "recent" in the same way as human behavior or inventions.
C: The answer choice is incorrect because the rancher who supplied Ken Dial with birds advised him to give the Chukar Partridges something to climb on, which helped Ken Dial realize that elevated perches were the birds' preferred resting spot.
D: Ken Dial's research did not explore whether ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors evolved in parallel.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: Ken Dial conducted research to study how baby game birds learned to fly. He observed young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds running behind their parents in the wild. He settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species. The tendency of the species to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators led him to bring in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on in a controlled laboratory setup. While away on a short work trip, his son Terry Dial noticed that the birds were using their legs to run up the side of a hay bale instead of using their wings to fly up to their perches. When Ken came back and observed what was happening himself, he realized that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively. Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species.

Action: Answer("A")  
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial conducted an experiment to study what clues might contribute to the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate in birds.
  He observed a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, and other ground birds ran along behind their parents.
  Ground birds prefer to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators.
  The young of the Chukar Partridge, a common game bird, run and hop up inclines by flapping their half-formed wings.
  Wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) allowed young birds an alternative to flying and gave adults a way to climb steep inclines.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial designed a project to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.
  Young birds of several species prefer elevated perches where they are safe from predators. 
  Ken noticed that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches.
  The Chukar Partridge used their legs and wings cooperatively in flapping and running, a technique called wing-assisted incline running (WAIR).
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Ken Dial's central assumption is that study of the acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial studied young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds that learned to fly by jumping up like popcorn, and using their wings/legs cooperatively.
  He settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species.
  A local rancher challenged Dial's notion of birds learning to fly on the flat ground, and suggested that the birds needed something to climb on.
  The birds used the force generated by flapping their wings to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp, so that they could climb steep inclines.
  Ken Dial called this technique WAIR or wing assisted incline running.
  WAIR is an efficient alternative to flying.
  The discovery of WAIR refutes the traditional notions of flight acquisition in birds.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: Ken Dial conducted research on how baby game birds learn to fly and discovered that they use their wings and legs cooperatively in a technique he called "WAIR" (wing-assisted incline running) to climb up steep surfaces. He also found that the use of WAIR has surprising explanatory powers in the evolution of birds' flapping flight stroke and the aerodynamic function of half-formed wings.

Action: Answer("A") 
The central assumption in Ken Dial's research was that the acquisition of flight in young birds can provide information about the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. This is supported by his discovery of the WAIR technique and its implications for the evolution of birds' flight stroke and aerodynamics. Therefore, choice A is the correct answer.
Response 9:

It is a mighty people that $\mathrm{He}$ has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile ... working-folk10 of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes-the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a15 history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands ... a history of soldiers, who carried the flag20 across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century ... a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous 25 reasoning we find ourselves to-day....Think of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic's laws cover those islands with justice and safety!

Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, "Give me liberty or give me death," he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or 75 spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so80 low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also85 calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being
Choices:
  A: unrealistic, since most Americans would be unwilling to relocate to distant islands.
  B: deceptive, since economic domination would be the true goal of the American government.
  C: impractical, since the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources.
  D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Both passages discuss the topic of American governance of island territories.
  Passage 1 presents a vision of America's role in the world as one that involves establishing a liberal government in territories like Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippines. It asserts that it is right for the United States to hold these territories permanently and claims that the inhabitants of these territories will benefit from American governance.
  Passage 2 argues against the idea that America should enter into a career of empire, stating that the principle of self-government should not be repudiated in the Philippines. It suggests that imposing foreign dominion on a people will create perpetual hatred and goes so far as to criticize revered American statesmen like Patrick Henry, Jefferson, Washington, and Lincoln who spoke out against political bondage.
  
Action: Answer("D")  
The author of Passage 2, Bryan, would most likely criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 as "naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans."
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 extols the virtues of American empire and the benefits of governing island territories like the Philippines.
  Passage 2 criticizes American empire and argues that the principle of self-government must be upheld in both the Philippines and in America. 
  Bryan expresses the view that American governance of island territories is not justifiable, and that any such attempts will face resistance from the people. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 contrasts with Passage 1 with regards to the issue of imperialism.
  Passage 2 argues against American imperialism.
  Passage 1 presents a vision of a greater America, with new territories overseas.
  Neither passage mentions issues such as relocation or resource distribution.
  A: Not supported by the passages.
  B: Not directly stated in Passage 1 and contradicted by the anti-imperialist stance taken in Passage 2.
  C: Not mentioned in either passage.
  D: Closest answer to the views presented in Passage 2, which criticize the idea of American governance of foreign territories and foreign people.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2: Bryan criticizes the imperialistic vision of American governance of island territories.
  He argues that it contradicts the principles of self-government and liberty set forth in the Declaration of Independence.
  Passage 1: Beveridge presents an imperialistic vision of American governance of overseas territories, including the Philippines.
  He argues that it is the duty of Americans to spread their institutions and values abroad, even through force if necessary.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 refers to the greatness of America and its people and includes examples of recent territorial expansions. 
  Passage 2 refers to the Republican Party's proposal in 1900 to permanently hold the Philippine Islands and questions the morality of such an imperialistic policy.
  
Analysis:
  Bryan, as the author of Passage 2, argues against imperialistic policies like the one advocated by Beveridge in Passage 1, stating that it is not right for the United States to permanently hold any country as a colony and that such policies would be detrimental to both the subject territories and the United States. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 express different viewpoints about the United States' possession and governance of foreign territories, specifically the Philippines.
  Passage 1 glorifies and legitimizes American imperialism, emphasizing its benefits for the territories and the United States.
  Passage 2 criticizes American imperialism as contradicting the principles of liberty and self-government, and predicts negative consequences for both the territories and the United States.
  None of the answer choices make sense in the context of the passages.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a vision of American imperialism as a means for bringing civilization and prosperity to countries like the Philippines and Cuba. 
  Passage 2 criticizes this vision, arguing that it is incompatible with America's founding principles of self-government and liberty.
  A: Passage 2 does not address the practicality of Americans relocating to distant islands.
  B: Passage 2 does not argue that economic domination would be the true goal of American governance of island territories.
  C: Passage 2 does not mention an equal distribution of resources as a concern for islanders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 offers Bryan's perspective on American governance of territories, in contrast to Passage 1, which presents Beveridge's perspective.
  Passage 2 suggests that Bryan criticizes those advocating for American empire and governance of the Philippines, rather than advocating such governance himself.
  Neither Passage 1 nor Passage 2 refers to the islanders' willingness to be governed by Americans.
  Passage 2 argues that imperialism would be harmful to both the territories and to the United States itself, and that it would violate the principle of self-government.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes the United States as a "greater England with a nobler destiny" and predicts that the country will build a civilization of energy and industry in island territories.
  Passage 2 argues that if the United States intends to hold the Philippines and govern it as a colony, it must be prepared to face resistance and protest from the people living there, and that the principles of self-government and individual liberty must remain central to American governance at home and abroad.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes the greatness of the United States and the potential benefits of expanding American territories to include places like Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippines.
  Passage 2 suggests that if the United States wants to hold the Philippines permanently and govern it as a colony like European empires, then the Republican party should state and defend its position. However, this would cause resentment and resistance among the subject races, who desire a voice in their own government.
  
Action: Answer("D") 
It can be most reasonably inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being 'naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans'. This is suggested by Bryan's argument that God has placed in every human heart the love of liberty and that even a war of conquest would leave a legacy of perpetual hatred if it were to disregard the principle of self-government. Thus, Bryan is likely to believe that the islanders in the Philippines would resist being governed by Americans who do not respect their voice in their own government.

Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that a focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' rights is important for addressing their disadvantage.
  The author criticizes a 'practical' approach to Indigenous issues that lacks accountability and engagement with Indigenous peoples.
  The author suggests that a human rights approach can provide a means for Indigenous peoples to express their claims to equal goods, services, and protections of the law.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage argues that the historical approach of separating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rights from the practical concerns faced by indigenous peoples is a flawed approach as it distinguishes human rights issues from indigenous peoples' disadvantage and it limits government accountability. The passage also argues that rights and practical measures should not be viewed as mutually exclusive, but should work together, as human rights give indigenous peoples a means of expressing their legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and protections of the law, while the practical measures provide concrete ways to address the issues faced by indigenous peoples.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage argues that a focus on human rights is necessary to address the disadvantage experienced by Indigenous peoples. The passage rejects the idea that there is a contradiction between improving Indigenous peoples' human rights and addressing their practical needs. Rather, the passage argues, human rights are necessary to ensure that Indigenous peoples have access to the goods, services, legal protections, and outcomes that all citizens are entitled to. The passage presents the lack of accountability that has accompanied a "practical" approach to Indigenous issues as a key flaw of this approach, arguing that a rights-based approach provides a more effective framework for addressing Indigenous disadvantage.  

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the false dichotomy of focusing on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' rights versus addressing their disadvantage. It suggests that human rights should be used as a framework for government policy on Indigenous issues. The passage specifically calls for a cultural shift in how human rights are conceptualized in the country, and discusses the importance of lifting expectations of what needs to be done to address the issues faced by Indigenous peoples.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the false dichotomy between a focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights and addressing their disadvantage. This approach is described as seriously flawed. Instead, human rights should be used as a framework for government policy on Indigenous issues. The passage cites the Statement of Intent to close the gap in health inequality as an example of the type of approach that is needed across all areas of poverty, marginalisation, and disadvantage experienced by Indigenous peoples. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author believes that focusing on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights is important and is not a distraction from addressing their disadvantage.
  The author also believes that the "practical approach" to issues of poverty, marginalisation, and disadvantage experienced by Indigenous peoples has lacked accountability and has not been effective in making sufficient progress.
  The author suggests that human rights can serve as a tool for best practice policy development and as an accountability mechanism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the flaws in the approach that views the focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights as taking away from the practical concerns of indigenous communities. The author argues that human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard that government is required to measure up to. The author also discusses the importance of engaging Indigenous peoples in policy development and as an accountability mechanism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
The passage argues that the focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights is not separate from the need to address their disadvantage; rather, recognizing the rights of Indigenous peoples is a way to frame efforts to improve their conditions. It also argues that a “practical” approach to these issues—emphasizing record levels of expenditure without clear outcomes or accountability—has failed to engage Indigenous peoples and contributed to ongoing inequality. The passage advocates for a shift to a human rights-based approach that prioritizes the input and participation of Indigenous peoples in decision-making. 
A: The passage does not argue this position.
B: The passage does not make this claim. It emphasizes the need for a human rights framework, which could be funded in different ways, but it does not make a general claim about funding levels.
C: Correct. The passage argues that a human rights approach, which emphasizes equal goods, services, and legal protections for Indigenous peoples, is necessary to address the ongoing challenges faced by Indigenous communities in Australia. It further points to the importance of engaging Indigenous communities in policy development and decision-making.
D: While the passage is critical of a “practical” approach that overlooks concerns of Indigenous communities, it does not argue against focusing on their rights. Rather, it argues that emphasizing rights is a way to frame efforts to address disadvantage. 
Action: Answer("C")

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: The main purpose of the passage is to
Choices:
  A: contrast the tool-using behavior of wild and captive-raised woodpecker finches.
  B: describe experiments intended to clarify the benefits of tool use for woodpecker finches.
  C: discuss a study of the differences between primates and woodpecker finches with respect to tool use.
  D: present research that explains the development of tool-using behavior in woodpecker finches.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.The brains of humans are conspicuously larger than the.brains of other apes, but the human-specific genetic.factors responsible for the uniquely large human.neocortex remain obscure. Since humans split from.chimps, which have brains roughly a third of human size,.the human genome has undergone roughly 15 million.changes. Which of these genetic tweaks could have led to.big brains?.About six years ago, scientists in David Haussler’s lab at.Howard Hughes Medical Institute discovered a gene called.NOTCH2NL. It’s a relative of NOTCH2, a gene that.scientists knew was central to early brain development..NOTCH2 controls vital decisions regarding when and how.many neurons to make..When the Haussler team looked in the official version.of the human genome at that time^1 —version 37—.NOTCH2NL appeared to be located in chromosome 1.near a region linked to abnormal brain size. Delete a hunk.of the region, and brains tend to shrink. Duplicate part of.it, and brains tend to overgrow..“We thought, ‘Oh, this is incredible,’” Haussler said..NOTCH2NL seemed to check all the boxes for a key role.in human brain development. But when the team mapped.NOTCH2NL’s precise location in the genome, they.discovered the gene wasn’t actually in the relevant.chromosomal region after all; the once-promising.candidate seemed to be a dud..“We were downhearted,” Haussler recalled. That all.changed with the next official version of the human.genome—version 38. In this iteration, NOTCH2NL was.located in the crucial region. “And there were three.versions of it,” Haussler exclaimed. Over the last three.million years, his team calculated, NOTCH2NL was.repeatedly copy-pasted into the genome, what he calls “a.series of genetic accidents.”.Genetic analysis of several primate species revealed that.the three genes exist only in humans and their recent.relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, not in.chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. What’s more, the.timing of these genes’ emergence matches up with the.period in the fossil record when our ancestors’ craniums.began to enlarge, Haussler points out. Together, the results.suggest that NOTCH2NL genes played a role in beefing.up human brain size..Passage 2.Modern humans have brains that are more than three.times larger than our closest living relatives,.chimpanzees and bonobos. Scientists don’t agree on.when and how this dramatic increase took place, but.new analysis of 94 hominin fossils shows that average.brain size increased gradually and consistently over the.past three million years..The research, published in The Proceedings of the.Royal Society B, shows that the trend was caused.primarily by evolution of larger brains within.populations of individual species, but the introduction of.new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones also played a part..“Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that.makes us human. It’s related to cultural complexity,.language, tool making and all these other things that.make us unique,” said Andrew Du, PhD, a postdoctoral.scholar at the University of Chicago and first author of.the study. “The earliest hominins had brain sizes like.chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since.then. So, it’s important to understand how we got here.”.Du and his colleagues compared published research.data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13.different species, beginning with the earliest.unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including.Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size.began to overlap with that of modern-day humans..The researchers saw that when the species were.counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a.common ancestor, the average brain size increased.gradually over three million years. Looking more closely,.the increase was driven by three different factors,.primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within.individual species populations, but also by the addition.of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones..The study quantifies for the first time when and by.how much each of these factors contributes to the clade-.level pattern. Du said he likens it to how a football coach.might build a roster of bigger, strong players. One way.would be to make all the players hit the weight room to.bulk up. But the coach could also recruit new, larger.players and cut the smallest ones..(^1) The reference version of the human genome goes through updates to.more completely map out each chromosomal sequence.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.

Choices:
  A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
  B: beginning to return to the levels recorded in 2010.
  C: responding predictably to aggressive conservation attempts.
  D: declining steadily despite continual human intervention.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 talks about a new study from the World Wildlife Fund that suggests that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been rising over the last few years. However, although the global number of wild tigers appears to have gone up, some countries have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 is critical of the methodology used in the count of wild tigers, which it considers flawed and misleading to the public. It suggests that the overall number of wild tigers may not matter as much as the need to guard and grow the source populations.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Based on the passages, both authors would likely agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others. Although the global number of wild tigers appears to have gone up according to the WWF report mentioned in Passage 1, the passages also mention that some countries have actually seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 suggests that the number of wild tigers may be on the rise due to successful conservation efforts in some countries, but factors like poaching and habitat loss have led to declines in other areas.
  Passage 2 criticizes the use of flawed methodologies to estimate wild tiger populations and suggests that monitoring and protecting source populations is the most important conservation priority.

Action: Answer("A")  
Both passages suggest that wild tiger populations are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others, as successful conservation efforts have led to increases in some areas but declines continue in others.
Response 2:
Knowledge:

  Passage 1 states that a new report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) suggests that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years. 
  Passage 1 also mentions that while there has been an overall global increase in wild tiger populations, country-by-country analysis shows that some countries have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 argues that the tally of wild tiger populations based on official estimates is flawed and that these estimates are based on weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of animal droppings.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a new report by the World Wildlife Fund that suggests the number of wild tigers may have been slowly rising over the last several years, if continued surveys prove this to be true, it would mark the first time in more than a century that tiger populations have grown. Based on a study compiling surveys taken across Asia, researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today.
  Passage 2 criticizes the WWF's tally, based on official estimates, of the world’s wild tiger population at 3,890 individuals because it relied on flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor. Moreover, apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years.

Action: Answer("A") 
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 mentions that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years, and that the increased numbers may in part reflect better surveying methods. The study suggests that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. However, the passage goes on to mention that while the global number of wild tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country analysis is more sobering, as some countries have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 mentions that the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, but its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has been slow. The passage notes that the overall number of tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not matter as much as the need to monitor the source populations vigilantly. The passage also notes that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from focusing on monitoring the source populations.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 talks about a new study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), according to which the number of tigers living in the wild may have slowly risen over the last several years, possibly marking the first time in over a century that tiger populations have grown. The study suggests that conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. However, counting wild tigers is not easy, and poaching and habitat loss have caused some countries to see tigers disappear.
  Passage 2 talks about how although the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not been effective. The author criticizes the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor to estimate tiger numbers. The author further argues that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from the need to monitor the source populations vigilantly, using the best science available to track their numbers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 states that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years, but also notes that a country-by-country analysis is sobering because while several countries have gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss. The increased numbers may reflect better surveying methods. 
  Passage 2 criticizes reliance on outdated tools for tiger population assessments and states that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers. The author argues that we need to monitor source populations vigilantly, use the best science available to track their numbers, and only with reliable counts can we set realistic goals for future growth and measure the impact of our conservation efforts.

Action: Answer("A") 
Based on the information provided in both passages, it can be reasonably inferred that their authors would both agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries (such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia) than in others and that conservation efforts to increase tiger populations have been successful in some areas but not necessarily across all regions where tigers historically roamed.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 states that according to a new report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years. It also suggests that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. However, it also mentions that while several countries have seen increases in tiger populations, others have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 discusses how the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, but governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies have been slow to adopt these new methods. It also criticizes the use of flawed methodologies, such as statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor, to estimate tiger numbers. It suggests that the overall number of wild tigers may not matter as much as monitoring the source populations using the best science available to track their numbers and set realistic goals for future growth.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 reports a new study indicating the number of wild tigers may have slowly risen over the last several years due to effective conservation programs in some countries. However, counting wild tigers is difficult since their habitats have become tiny and scattered, and they are notoriously elusive. Additionally, while the global number of wild tigers appears to have gone up, some countries have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 argues that the recent announcement by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum stating that the planet’s wild tiger population is at last on the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals, was flawed and undermined efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from the need to guard and grow the source populations, as only with reliable counts can realistic goals for future growth be set.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar. In 1789,.the French formed a new governmental body known as the.National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of.political and social change known as the French Revolution..To make a government requires no great.prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience,.and the work is done. To give freedom is still more.easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to.let go the rein. But to form a free government, that is,.to temper together these opposite elements of liberty.and restraint in one consistent work, requires much.thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and.combining mind. This I do not find in those who.take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they.are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather.believe it. It would put them below the common level.of human understanding. But when the leaders.choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of.popularity, their talents, in the construction of the.state, will be of no service. They will become.flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not.the guides, of the people. If any of them should.happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly.limited and defined with proper qualifications, he.will be immediately outbid by his competitors who.will produce something more splendidly popular..Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause..Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of.cowards, and compromise as the prudence of.traitors, until, in hopes of preserving the credit which.may enable him to temper and moderate, on some.occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become.active in propagating doctrines and establishing.powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose.at which he ultimately might have aimed..But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all.that deserves commendation in the indefatigable.labors of this Assembly? I do not deny that, among.an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some.good may have been done. They who destroy.everything certainly will remove some grievance..They who make everything new have a chance that.they may establish something beneficial. To give.them credit for what they have done in virtue of the.authority they have usurped, or which can excuse.them in the crimes by which that authority has been.acquired, it must appear that the same things could.not have been accomplished without producing such.a revolution. Most assuredly they might....Some.usages have been abolished on just grounds, but.they were such that if they had stood as they were to.all eternity, they would little detract from the.happiness and prosperity of any state. The.improvements of the National Assembly are.superficial, their errors fundamental..Whatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather.to recommend to our neighbors the example of the.British constitution than to take models from them.for the improvement of our own. In the former, they.have got an invaluable treasure. They are not, I think,.without some causes of apprehension and complaint,.but these they do not owe to their constitution but to.their own conduct. I think our happy situation owing.to our constitution, but owing to the whole of it, and.not to any part singly, owing in a great measure to.what we have left standing in our several reviews and.reformations as well as to what we have altered or.superadded. Our people will find employment.enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent.spirit in guarding what they possess from violation. I.would not exclude alteration neither, but even when.I changed, it should be to preserve. I should be led to.my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I.should follow the example of our ancestors. I would.make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style.of the building. A politic caution, a guarded.circumspection, a moral rather than a complexional.timidity were among the ruling principles of our.forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being.illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of.France tell us they have got so abundant a share, they.acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and.fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus.fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct.attended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution.if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their.bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let us preserve.what they have left; and, standing on the firm ground.of the British constitution, let us be satisfied to.admire rather than attempt to follow in their.desperate flights the aeronauts of France.
Question: It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly’s decision to
Choices:
  A: limit the king’s power.
  B: expand the size of the government.
  C: seek the approval of the public.
  D: ignore the advice of former leaders.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the French Revolution, specifically the formation of the National Assembly and its actions. Edmund Burke expresses his dissatisfaction with the approach taken by the leaders of the National Assembly in forming a free government. Burke believes that moderation and compromise are important virtues in the creation of a sustainable government. Burke suggests that the leaders of the Assembly are focused on creating policies that are popular rather than those that are helpful, and that this will ultimately lead to negative consequences. Burke believes that the British constitution is a better model for government than the French approach.

Action: Answer("B") 
Based on the given knowledge, it cannot be inferred that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to limit the king's power (A) or ignore the advice of former leaders (D). The passage does not provide enough information to support choice (C) about seeking the approval of the public. However, Burke is critical of the National Assembly's approach to creating a government, particularly their focus on policies that are more popular than helpful. Therefore, from the given knowledge, it can be reasonably inferred that Burke is upset with the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of the government (B).
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar.
  The National Assembly was formed in 1789, leading to the French Revolution.
  Burke believed that forming a free government, that is, to temper together these opposite elements of liberty and restraint in one consistent work, required much thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and combining mind.
  He criticized the leaders of the National Assembly for making themselves bidders at an auction of popularity, their talents in the construction of the state would be of no service, and they would become flatterers instead of legislators. 
  Burke believed that moderation would be stigmatized as the virtue of cowards and compromise as the prudence of traitors, leading the popular leader to be obliged to become active in propagating doctrines and establishing powers that would afterwards defeat any sober purpose at which he ultimately might have aimed. 
  Burke believed that some good may have been done among an infinite number of acts of violence and folly. 
  Burke believed that the improvements of the National Assembly were superficial, and their errors fundamental.
Action: Answer("B") 
Based on the passage, it cannot be inferred that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to limit the king's power or ignore the advice of former leaders. It is not explicitly stated whether the National Assembly sought the approval of the public or expanded the size of the government; therefore, it is not reasonable to infer that Burke is particularly upset with those decisions. However, the passage reveals that Burke believed that the leaders of the National Assembly were more interested in becoming popular than in exercising their talents in the construction of the state. Therefore, Burke is more upset with the National Assembly's obsession with popularity than with any specific decision the National Assembly made. None of the choices directly reflect this inference. However, choice B, "expand the size of the government," is the closest answer since it implies that the National Assembly was increasing its own power and influence which aligns with Burke's criticism. Therefore, the best answer among the given choices is B.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about Burke's thoughts on the French Revolution and the National Assembly.
  The passage mentions that Burke believes forming a free government requires deep reflection and a combining mind, and he does not see these in the leaders of the National Assembly.
  He criticizes the leaders of the National Assembly for making themselves bidders at an auction of popularity and being instruments, not guides, of the people.
  Burke believes that it is difficult to form a free government that balances liberty and restraint in one consistent work.
Action: Answer("C") 
Based on Burke's criticism of the National Assembly leaders for being more concerned with being popular ("bidders at an auction of popularity") than guiding the people, it can be inferred that he would be particularly upset with their decision to seek the approval of the public. Therefore, the best answer is C: seek the approval of the public.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the French Revolution and provides Burke's opinion on the National Assembly.
  Burke suggests that creating a free government is a challenging task that involves combining liberty and restraint.
  Burke is critical of the National Assembly's leaders for being more interested in gaining popularity than in creating a well-functioning government.

Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Burke suggests that the leaders of the National Assembly are more interested in winning popular support than in creating a government that works well. Burke notes that the leaders have started to "make themselves bidders at an auction of popularity" and that they will "become flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not the guides, of the people." This indicates that Burke is upset with the National Assembly's decision to seek the approval of the public.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar.
  The French Revolution began in 1789 after the formation of a new governmental body known as the National Assembly.
  Burke is critical of the National Assembly's attempts at forming a new government, but acknowledges that some good may have been done.
  Burke believes that changes to a government should be made cautiously and in consideration of past experiences.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: While Burke is critical of many aspects of the National Assembly's actions, he is particularly upset with their expansion of the size of the government. He notes that they are "making everything new" and are more concerned with "popularity" than with governing effectively. Therefore, the best answer is B: expand the size of the government.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar.
  In 1789, the French formed a new governmental body known as the National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of political and social change known as the French Revolution.
  Burke suggests that it is difficult to form a free government that balances liberty and restraint. He is critical of the National Assembly's leaders, who he sees as more interested in popularity than in legislating well.
Action: Answer("B")  
Reasoning: In the passage, Burke does not seem to be upset about the National Assembly limiting the king's power (A) or ignoring the advice of former leaders (D). While the National Assembly sought the approval of the public (C), Burke's main criticism seems to be that its leaders were more concerned with being popular than with governing effectively. Given his emphasis on the difficulty of balancing liberty and restraint, and his criticism of the Assembly's leaders, it is reasonable to infer that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of the government. Answer choice (B) is the best answer.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar and this passage represents his thoughts on the French Revolution.
  In this passage, Burke discusses the French Revolution and the work of the National Assembly.
  Burke believes that forming a free government that balances liberty and restraint requires much thought and deep reflection.
  Burke thinks that the National Assembly is not doing enough to maintain this balance and that they are instead focusing on popularity.
  Burke is particularly concerned with the Assembly’s focus on producing “something more splendidly popular” and that this will lead to doctrines and powers that will ultimately defeat any sober purpose at which the Assembly may have aimed.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke is a British politician and scholar writing about the French Revolution.
  The National Assembly was a French governmental body established in 1789, during the French Revolution.
  Burke is critical of the National Assembly, and argues that it is not capable of forming a free government that can balance liberty and restraint.
  Burke believes that the National Assembly is more concerned with popularity and flattery than constructing a thoughtful government rooted in moderation and compromise.

Action: Answer("B") 
Burke does not show any clear indication of being particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to limit the king's power, nor does he criticize them for ignoring the advice of former leaders. He does not provide any specific instances of the National Assembly seeking the approval of the public in his passage. However, he does criticize the National Assembly for being more concerned with popularity than in actually forming a thoughtful government. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of the government, which is reflected in the passage when he emphasizes their "infinite number of acts of violence and folly", and calls their improvements "superficial" and their errors "fundamental". Answer("B") is the best answer.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar who commented on the French Revolution after the National Assembly was formed in 1789.
  Burke believes it is challenging to create a free government that balanced liberty and restraint, and the leaders of the National Assembly lacked the necessary qualities to do this job.
  Burke believes that instead of being guides to the people, the leaders of the National Assembly were becoming instruments to gain popularity.
  Burke acknowledges some good works by the National Assembly, but he suggests that their improvements were superficial, while their errors were fundamental.
Action: Answer("B") 
Based on the given knowledge, we can infer that Burke is upset with the decision of the National Assembly to expand the size of the government.
Response 9:

Topic: English
Context: “I’ve come to inquire if you have work for me. That is, if.my performance pleased you before.” A deliberate prompt. I.didn’t want to be hired because of my need or his kindness. I.wanted my talent to be the reason he wanted me back..“Indeed” was all he offered..What now to fill the suspended moment? His new.projects. I asked. His eyebrows leapt up in symmetrical.curves..“A Byzantine chapel for the World’s Columbian.Exposition in Chicago next year. Four times bigger than the.Paris Exposition Universelle. It will be the greatest assembly.of artists since the fifteenth century.” He counted on his.fingers and then drummed them on the desk. “Only fifteen.months away. In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

Choices:
  A: reinforces negative attitudes about the government’s financial fitness.
  B: undermines efforts to standardize practices across all departments of the government.
  C: perpetuates the pattern of government officials abusing their authority.
  D: allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
Calma argues that the government's focus on expenditures without demonstrating specific health outcomes is flawed. The author states that this approach hinders accountability and government responsibility, and limits the ability of Aboriginal peoples to express their legitimate claims to equal rights.
A: There is no evidence in the passage that suggests Calma believes this approach reinforces negative attitudes about the government’s financial fitness.
B: There is no evidence in the passage that suggests Calma is concerned with undermining efforts to standardize practices across all departments of the government.
C: There is no evidence in the passage that suggests Calma is accusing government officials of abusing their authority.
D: Calma argues that the government's failure to link its expenditures on indigenous health initiatives to specific health outcomes is harmful because it "limits the accountability and responsibilities of government." Therefore, the correct answer is D. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the flaws in a "practical" approach to Indigenous rights and installing a focus on human rights in policies for Indigenous peoples. 
  The passage also suggests that the "practical approach" hasn't held government officials accountable nor has the "practical approach" encouraged progress for Indigenous peoples. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Calma argues that the government’s focus on "practical measures" was exemplified by the emphasis the previous federal government placed on the "record levels of expenditure" annually on Indigenous issues. Since when did the size of the input become more important than the intended outcomes? The previous government never explained what the point of the record expenditure argument was—or what achievements were made. And the fact is that there has been no simple way of being able to decide whether the progress made through “record expenditure” has been “good enough”. So the "practical" approach to these issues has lacked any accountability whatsoever. Calma observes that this approach makes it too easy to disguise any causal relationship between the actions of government and any outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and responsibilities of government. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  According to Calma, the government's focus on record levels of expenditure on Indigenous issues is an inadequate approach because it fails to link expenditures to specific outcomes or measures of success. This lack of accountability limits the government's responsibilities and allows it to avoid answering for its policies. 
  A: This choice is not supported by the context.
  B: This choice is not supported by the context.
  C: This choice is not supported by the context.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the flaws of a "practical" approach to addressing the disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, which focuses on expenditures without clearly linking them to specific outcomes. The author argues that a human rights approach, which focuses on equal goods, services, and protections of the law, is more effective and holds the government accountable.
  A: The passage does not suggest that the government's failure to link expenditures to specific outcomes reinforces negative attitudes about the government's financial fitness.
  B: The passage does not suggest that the government's failure to link expenditures to specific outcomes undermines efforts to standardize practices across all departments of the government.
  C: The passage does not suggest that the government's failure to link expenditures to specific outcomes perpetuates the pattern of government officials abusing their authority.
  D: The passage suggests that the government's failure to link expenditures to specific outcomes allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the false dichotomy between Indigenous peoples' rights and disadvantage, the importance of human rights in addressing disadvantage, and the government's lack of accountability in its expenditure on Indigenous issues. 
  A: The passage does not mention anything about reinforcing negative attitudes regarding the government's financial fitness.
  B: The passage does not discuss any efforts to standardize practices across all departments of the government.
  C: The passage does not mention anything about government officials abusing their authority.
  D: The passage argues that the practical approach lacks accountability for government policies and prevents the evaluation of the outcomes of their initiatives. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage mentions that instead of focusing on how much money is being spent, the government should focus on the actual outcomes and achievements made through the expenditure. The passage also notes that the "practical approach" lacks any accountability since there is no way to measure or determine whether the progress from the expenditure has been good enough.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Calma argues that the government's emphasis on expenditures on Indigenous issues without linking them to specific outcomes lacks accountability.
  A: Calma's argument does not suggest that it reinforces negative attitudes about the government's financial fitness.
  B: Calma's argument does not suggest that it undermines efforts to standardize practices across all departments of the government.
  C: Calma's argument does not relate to government officials abusing their authority.
  D: The lack of linkage between expenditures and outcomes limits the accountability of the government, according to Calma.
Action: Answer("D")

  A: The passage does not mention reinforcing negative attitudes about the government's financial fitness as a reason.
  B: The passage does not mention standardizing practices across all departments of the government as a reason.
  C: The passage does not mention officials abusing their authority as a reason.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it
Choices:
  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
  A: The passage does not mention anything about the Venus flytrap's ability to identify the species of its prey.
  B: According to research, the Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close.  The trap requires this amount of calcium to spring close, so it would not appear that this system conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.  By requiring the touch of two trigger hairs, this system safeguards the plant's energy supply by preventing the trap from expending its energy to catch something that is too small to be of value.
  D: The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The multiple trigger system allows the trap to recall the memory of the first touch and not close before capturing the prey once a second trigger is touched. This system ensures that the plant does not close before capturing its prey.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap wants to spring closed when it's sure that the prey is large enough to be worth its time, and the large black hairs on their lobes allow them to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the trap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. Only when two different hairs are touched, a trap spring is closed.
  The plant stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf, and touching a trigger hair causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap, thus causing a  rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close, and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the visiting insect is large enough to be worth its time.
  When a single hair touches an insect, the trap won't spring shut.
  A large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within 20 seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
  The plant requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close, and a single hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the passage, a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Response 3:
Knowledge:  The Venus flytrap requires at least two hairs on its lobes to be triggered within about 20 seconds to close its trap and capture its prey. A single trigger from one hair will not cause the trap to shut. Touching one hair only encodes the information but does not store it. Storing the information requires a relatively high concentration of calcium so that a second touch increases calcium levels above a threshold, causing the trap to shut. If a second touch doesn't happen quickly enough, the memory of the first touch is lost.
A: The passage does not mention that the Venus flytrap's requirements for multiple triggers enable the plant to identify the species of its prey.
B: The Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is proposed to be based on the need to maintain a high enough level of calcium for the trap to close. This does not necessarily mean that it conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
C: The passage does not mention that the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers safeguards the plant's energy supply.
D: The Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers ensures that the trap does not close before capturing its prey. A single trigger from one hair will not cause the trap to shut. Touching one hair only encodes the information but does not store it. Storing the information requires a relatively high concentration of calcium so that a second touch increases calcium levels above a threshold. This means that a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against the next hair. The memory of the first touch is lost, and the trap will not close. Therefore, the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers within a certain timeframe to close its trap.
  Closing and reopening the trap requires a huge energy expense, so the Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
  The encoding of the information regarding the prey's trigger is maintained by keeping a high-enough level of calcium so that a second trigger can push the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  If the second trigger doesn't happen in a certain timeframe, the final calcium concentration won't be high enough to close the trap and the memory is lost.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  A second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  If the second trigger doesn't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires two triggers from its prey in order to conserve the energy required to close its trap. 
  A: The passage does not mention that the Venus flytrap uses multiple triggers to identify the species of its prey. 
  B: The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close, so two triggers are needed to increase the concentration of calcium ions to the threshold required to spring the trap. 
  C: The passage explains that the Venus flytrap conserves its energy supply by only closing its trap when it's sure that the prey is large enough to be worth its time, which is determined by the requirement for two triggers. 
  D: The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires two triggers from its prey in order to prevent it from wasting the energy needed to close its trap if the prey is too small. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger to initiate closing of its trap.
  Closing the trap requires a large energy expense and reopening can take several hours.
  The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect is large enough to be worth its time.
  Encoding and storage of the information from an insect's encounter happens through the concentration of calcium ions in the electric charges of its leaf.
  The Venus flytrap tends to lose the storage of information if the second touch and potential do not happen quickly.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap needs to identify the right prey before closing its trap to conserve energy.
  It needs to touch two trigger hairs to ensure that the prey is large enough to be worth capturing.
  Closing its trap requires a lot of energy and reopening it can take several hours.
  The Venus flytrap encodes and stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close, and a single touch does not reach this level.
  Touching a trigger hair induces calcium channels to open in the trap, causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.
  The Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple touches ensures that enough calcium is accumulated to make the trap close and conserve energy, but the memory is lost if the second touch takes longer than twenty seconds.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap needs to save energy and only wants to spring closed when it is sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
  The large black hairs on their leaves allow the Venus flytraps to feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the trap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap.
  If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the ant happily meanders on.
  The Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close, and a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.

Choices:
  A: regularly observe other members of their species using tools.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how woodpecker finches and New Caledonian crows develop tool use behavior.
  The study shows that woodpecker finches can develop tool use in the absence of socially transmitted information, unlike primates who have been shown to develop tool use through social learning.
  It is suggested that the genetic pre-disposition for tool use in woodpecker finches is advantageous due to their solitary social system, unlike primates who have multiple tool-using models available.
  The passage does not provide specific information about the social system of primates in terms of tool use.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The social system of primates is such that young animals have the opportunity to use social learning to acquire tool use.
A: The passage states that previous studies have shown that several forms of tool use in primates develop via social learning, and that young woodpecker finches that were given the opportunity to observe tool use developed the ability to use tools similarly to their siblings. However, the passage does not mention how regularly young primates observe other members of their species using tools; it only suggests that social learning plays a role in tool use acquisition in primates.
B: The passage does not mention whether primates can reach maturity without having learned to use tools to acquire food, so this cannot be the correct answer choice.
C: The passage does not mention that primates restrict the transmission of tool-related knowledge to close relatives only; in fact, the passage suggests that primates use social learning to acquire tool use from others in their social group.
D: The passage suggests that relying on social transmission of knowledge about tool use would be too risky for young woodpecker finches, since they are solitary birds and are unlikely to encounter tool-using adults that are not their parents.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. "They jumped up like popcorn," he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. "He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. "I asked 35 him how it went," Ken recalled, "and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' " Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the "aha" moment. "The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively," he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. "It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car," he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)
Question: What can reasonably be inferred about gliding animals from the passage?
Choices:
  A: Their young tend to hop along beside their parents instead of flying beside them.
  B: Their method of locomotion is similar to that of ground birds.
  C: They use the ground for feeding more often than for perching.
  D: They do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a discovery made about how baby game birds learn to fly, specifically focusing on the Chukar Partridge as a model species.
  The birds were observed using their wings and legs cooperatively to climb inclined surfaces, in a technique called WAIR (wing-assisted incline running).
  The use of WAIR provides an energy-efficient alternative to flying and is a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds.
 
Action: Answer("D")
Based on the passage, it can be reasonably inferred that gliding animals do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes, as the article mentions that WAIR (which involves flapping the wings in a downward and backward motion while running up inclines) is a unique and specific technique used by birds. Therefore, the correct answer is D: They do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how ground birds, such as pheasants and quail, learn to fly by using their wings and legs cooperatively to climb up slopes. This is called wing-assisted incline running (WAIR), which allows the birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life and also gives adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying. The passage does not provide any information about gliding animals or their method of locomotion.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Ken Dial's research on ground birds, specifically the Chukar Partridge.
  Ken Dial discovered that ground birds use their wings to aid in climbing up slopes, a technique he named WAIR (wing-assisted incline running).

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses how young ground birds learn to fly using a technique called WAIR, which involves using wings to assist in incline running. The passage also compares this to the traditional theories of how birds learned to fly, including the ground-up hypothesis and the tree-down hypothesis.

A: The passage does not provide any information about how the young of gliding animals move around.

B: The passage does not say that the method of locomotion of gliding animals is similar to that of ground birds. In fact, it specifically contrasts gliding animals with ground birds in the context of the ground-up hypothesis.

C: The passage does mention that ground birds prefer perches to the ground, but it does not discuss the behavior of gliding animals.

D: The passage does not provide any information about whether gliding animals use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes.

C: The passage does not describe how often gliding animals use the ground for feeding or perching.
D: The passage notes that gliding animals do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes, but it does not describe any details about their method of locomotion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the WAIR (wing-assisted incline running) technique used by many ground birds, including Chukar Partridges, and how it allows them to climb steep slopes with the help of their wings in a way that is different from how they use their wings to fly. The passage also describes the discovery of the WAIR technique and how it relates to the debate over the evolution of flight in birds. However, the passage does not provide any information to infer one of the answers with certainty.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) in ground birds, particularly the Chukar partridge. WAIR involves using flapping motions to assist with climbing steep slopes. The technique was discovered when birds given a surface to climb on (in addition to the ground) used a combination of flapping and leg-running to climb. WAIR allows young birds to climb soon after hatching and allows adults to climb slopes efficiently without using excessive energy on flight.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis," says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. "Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth," Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. "We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment," Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 "standard of care treatment." That's going to take five years and $\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.
Question: In the last sentence of Passage 2, the author uses the phrase "five years and $\pounds 500$ million" primarily to
Choices:
  A: emphasize the scale of the effort needed to make teixobactin available for consumer use.
  B: criticize the level of funding that the government has committed to teixobactin development.

### Exam: sat-en-100 | Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

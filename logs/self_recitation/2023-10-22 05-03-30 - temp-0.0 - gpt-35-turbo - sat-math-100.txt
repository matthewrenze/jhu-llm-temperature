Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  We need to find the value of the equipment 4 years after it is purchased.
  
Solution:
  The equipment depreciates at a constant rate for 12 years, so the depreciation per year is $\frac{\$ 32,400}{12} = \$ 2,700$.
  After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated by $4 \times \$ 2,700 = \$ 10,800$.
  Therefore, the value of the equipment after 4 years is $\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$.

Knowledge:
  The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.
  The volume of the syrup is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
  The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.
  The height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$.
Action: 
  The volume of the syrup is equal to the volume of the cylinder, so we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to find the radius of the base:
  $110 = \pi r^2 (10)$
  $r^2 = \frac{110}{10\pi}$
  $r \approx 1.76$
  Therefore, the volume of the fruit is:
  $V_{fruit} = \pi r^2 h - 110$
  $V_{fruit} = \pi (1.76)^2 (10) - 110$
  $V_{fruit} \approx 185$

Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 10
  C: 13
  D: 17
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We have two equations with two variables, $w$ and $t$.
  We can solve for $w$ and $t$ by using elimination or substitution method.
  Once we find the values of $w$ and $t$, we can calculate $2w+3t$.

  We can solve this problem by expanding the left-hand side of the equation and comparing the coefficients of each term with the right-hand side of the equation.
Action: 
Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get:
$$5a x^3 - ab x^2 + (20a + 12)x^2 + (-3b + 15a)x + 12 = 20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
Comparing the coefficients of each term, we get the following system of equations:
$$\begin{cases} 5a = 20 \\ ab = 9 \\ 20a + 12 = 0 \\ -3b + 15a = -2 \end{cases}$$
Solving this system of equations, we get:
$$a = 4, b = \frac{9}{4}$$

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, then the equation of the line can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  The slope of the line passing through two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$.
  We can use the table to find two points on the line and then calculate the slope of the line.
Action: 
  The slope of the line passing through $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$ is $m=\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{1}{2}$.
  The slope of the line passing through $(3a,-a)$ and $(5a,-2a)$ is $m=\frac{-2a+a}{5a-3a}=-\frac{a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$.
  Therefore, the slope of the line passing through all three points is $-\frac{1}{2}$.
  We can use the point $(a,0)$ to find the $y$-intercept of the line: $0=-\frac{1}{2}a+b$, so $b=\frac{1}{2}a$.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a$.
  We can rewrite this equation as $x+2y=5a$.

Question: A psychologist set up an experiment to study the tendency of a person to select the first item when presented with a series of items. In the experiment, 300 people were presented with a set of five pictures arranged in random order. Each person was asked to choose the most appealing picture. Of the first 150 participants, 36 chose the first picture in the set. Among the remaining 150 participants, $p$ people chose the first picture in the set. If more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set, which of the following inequalities best describes the possible values of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $p>0.20(300-36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  B: $p>0.20(300+36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  C: $p-36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$
  D: $p+36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
Let $a$ be the number of people who chose the first picture among the first 150 participants, and let $b$ be the number of people who chose the first picture among the remaining 150 participants. Then, we have $a=36$ and we want to find an inequality for $b$ such that more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set.

Solution:
The total number of people who chose the first picture is $a+b$. The total number of participants is 300. We want more than $20 \%$ of all participants to choose the first picture. This means that $a+b > 0.20(300) = 60$. Substituting $a=36$, we get $b > 24$. Since there are 150 remaining participants, we have $b \leq 150$. Therefore, the best inequality that describes the possible values of $p$ is:
$$\boxed{\textbf{(A) } p>0.20(300-36), \text{ where } p \leq 150}$$

$$\boxed{\textbf{(A) } p>0.20(300-36), \text{ where } p \leq 150}$$
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
Let $a$ be the number of people who chose the first picture among the first 150 participants, and let $b$ be the number of people who chose the first picture among the remaining 150 participants. Then, we have $a=36$ and we want to find an inequality for $b$ such that more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set.

Solution:
The total number of people who chose the first picture is $a+b$. The total number of participants is 300. We want more than $20 \%$ of all participants to choose the first picture. This means that $a+b > 0.20(300) = 60$. Substituting $a=36$, we get $b > 24$. Since there are 150 remaining participants, we have $b \leq 150$.

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is an equivalent form of $(1.5 x-2.4)^{2}-\left(5.2 x^{2}-6.4\right) ?$
Choices:
  A: $-2.2 x^{2}+1.6$
  B: $-2.2 x^{2}+11.2$
  C: $-2.95 x^{2}-7.2 x+12.16$
  D: $-2.95 x^{2}-7.2 x+0.64$
Response 0:
Knowledge:
We can use the formula $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$ to expand the first term of the expression. Then, we can combine like terms to simplify the expression.

Action: 
Expanding the first term, we get:
$$(1.5x - 2.4)^2 = (1.5x)^2 - 2(1.5x)(2.4) + (2.4)^2 = 2.25x^2 - 7.2x + 5.76$$
Substituting this into the original expression, we get:
$$(1.5 x-2.4)^{2}-\left(5.2 x^{2}-6.4\right) = (2.25x^2 - 7.2x + 5.76) - (5.2x^2 - 6.4)$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$-2.95x^2 - 7.2x + 0.64$$
Therefore, the answer is (D) $-2.95x^2 - 7.2x + 0.64$.

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Near the end of a US cable news show, the host invited viewers to respond to a poll on the show's website that asked, "Do you support the new federal policy discussed during the show?" At the end of the show, the host reported that $28 \%$ responded "Yes," and $70 \%$ responded "No." Which of the following best explains why the results are unlikely to represent the sentiments of the population of the United States?
Choices:
  A: The percentages do not add up to $100 \%$, so any possible conclusions from the poll are invalid.
  B: Those who responded to the poll were not a random sample of the population of the United States.
  C: There were not $50 \%$ "Yes" responses and $50 \%$ "No" responses.
  D: The show did not allow viewers enough time to respond to the poll.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  This is a question about statistics and sampling.
  A: This statement is not true. Percentages do not need to add up to $100 \%$ in order to draw conclusions from a poll.

Question: If 50 one-cent coins were stacked on top of each other in a column, the column would be approximately $3 \frac{7}{8}$ inches tall. At this rate, which of the following is closest to the number of one-cent coins it would take to make an 8-inch-tall column?
Choices:
  A: 75
  B: 100
  C: 200
  D: 390
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  50 one-cent coins stacked on top of each other in a column is approximately $3 \frac{7}{8}$ inches tall.
  We can use proportions to solve this problem. If 50 coins is approximately $3 \frac{7}{8}$ inches, then we can set up the proportion: $\frac{50}{3 \frac{7}{8}} = \frac{x}{8}$, where x is the number of coins needed to make an 8-inch-tall column.
  We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying and simplifying the equation.

Knowledge:
  Let S1 be the number of subscriptions sold in 2012.
  Let S2 be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013.
  Let S3 be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  The percent increase from S1 to S2 is given by (S2-S1)/S1 * 100%.
  The percent increase from S2 to S3 is given by (S3-S2)/S2 * 100%.
  We are given that (S2-S1)/S1 * 100% = 2 * (S3-S2)/S2 * 100%.

Action: 
  Let's first find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013.
  percent increase = (S2-S1)/S1 * 100% = (5,880-5,600)/5,600 * 100% = 5%
  Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.
  We are given that 2x = (S2-S1)/S1 * 100% = 5%
  So, x = 2.5%
  Therefore, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is 2.5%.
  We can now find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  percent increase = (S3-S2)/S2 * 100% = 2.5%
  (S3-S2)/S2 = 0.025
  S3-S2 = 0.025*S2

  Let S3 be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  The percent increase from S1 to S2 is given by (S2-S1)/S1 * 100%.
  The percent increase from S2 to S3 is given by (S3-S2)/S2 * 100%.
  We are given that (S2-S1)/S1 * 100% = 2 * (S3-S2)/S2 * 100%.

Action: 
  Let's first find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013.
  percent increase = (S2-S1)/S1 * 100% = (5,880-5,600)/5,600 * 100% = 5%
  Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.
  We are given that 2x = (S2-S1)/S1 * 100% = 5%
  So, x = 2.5%
  Therefore, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is 2.5%.
  We can now find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  percent increase = (S3-S2)/S2 * 100% = 2.5%
  (S3-S2)/S2 = 0.025
  S3-S2 = 0.025*S2
  S3 = S2 + 0.025*S2 = 1.025*S2
  S2 = 5,880 subscriptions were sold in 2013.
  S3 = 1.025*5,880 = 6,027 subscriptions are expected to be sold in 2014.

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company purchased a machine valued at $\$ 120,000$. The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year so that after 10 years the value will be $\$ 30,000$. Which of the following equations gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased for $0 \leq t \leq 10 ?$
Choices:
  A: $v=30,000-9,000 t$
  B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$
  C: $v=120,000+9,000 t$
  D: $v=120,000-30,000 t$
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year.
  After 10 years the value will be $\$ 30,000$.
  The initial value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$.
  
To find the equation that gives the value of the machine, we can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.

Let $v$ be the value of the machine in dollars, and $t$ be the time in years since it was purchased. We know that the value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year, so the slope of the line is constant. Let $m$ be the slope of the line.

We can use the two points $(0,120000)$ and $(10,30000)$ to find the slope $m$:

$m = \frac{\text{change in }v}{\text{change in }t} = \frac{30000-120000}{10-0} = -9000$

The y-intercept is the initial value of the machine, which is $\$ 120,000$. Therefore, the equation that gives the value of the machine is:

$v = -9000t + 120000$

Choices:
  A: $(-3,0)$
  B: $(0,3)$
  C: $(6,-3)$
  D: $(36,-6)$
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We can solve the system of equations by substituting the first equation into the second equation and solving for $y$. Then we can substitute the value of $y$ into the first equation to solve for $x$.
Action: 
Substituting $x=y-3$ into $\frac{x}{2}+2y=6$ gives us:
$$\frac{y-3}{2}+2y=6$$
Simplifying the equation above gives us:
$$\frac{y}{2}+2y=9$$
Multiplying both sides by $2$ gives us:
$$y+4y=18$$
Simplifying the equation above gives us:
$$5y=18$$
Solving for $y$ gives us:
$$y=\frac{18}{5}$$
Substituting $y=\frac{18}{5}$ into $x=y-3$ gives us:
$$x=\frac{18}{5}-3=\frac{3}{5}$$
Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the system of equations is $\left(\frac{3}{5},\frac{18}{5}\right)$.

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Ken earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week.
  Ken earned $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week.
  Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week.
  We need to find the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week.
  
Solution:
  Let's assume that Ken worked $x$ hours for the rest of the week.
  Therefore, he worked $(10 + x)$ hours in total for the week.
  For the first 10 hours, he earned $\$ 8$ per hour, so he earned $10 \times 8 = \$ 80$.
  For the rest of the week, he earned $\$ 10$ per hour, so he earned $x \times 10 = 10x$.
  Therefore, his total earnings for the week is $80 + 10x$.
  He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80 + 10x) = 72 + 9x$.
  We need to find the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week.
  Therefore, we need to solve the inequality $72 + 9x \geq 270$.
  Solving for $x$, we get $x \geq 22$.
  Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.

Question: A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?

  D: 6
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let x be the number of 100-pound packages and y be the number of 120-pound packages.
  The helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y >= 10.
  The total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y <= 1,100.
  We want to maximize y, the number of 120-pound packages.
  
Solving the inequalities:
  From x + y >= 10, we get x >= 10 - y.
  Substituting into 100x + 120y <= 1,100, we get 100(10 - y) + 120y <= 1,100.

  Substituting into 100x + 120y <= 1,100, we get 100(10 - y) + 120y <= 1,100.
  Simplifying, we get 1,000 - 20y + 120y <= 1,100, which gives 100y <= 100, or y <= 1.
  Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 1.

Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Let x be the number of 100-pound packages and y be the number of 120-pound packages.
  The helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y >= 10.
  The total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y <= 1,100.
  We want to maximize y, the number of 120-pound packages.

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. What is the length of $\overline{A B}$ ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 12
  C: 14
  D: 16
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The equation of a parabola with vertex $(h,k)$ is given by $y-k=a(x-h)^2$.
  The equation of a horizontal line is given by $y=b$, where $b$ is a constant.
  To find the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points of two graphs, we set their equations equal to each other and solve for $x$.
  Once we have the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points, we can find the distance between them using the distance formula: $d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$.
  
Action: 
The equation of the parabola is $y=(x-11)^2$. The equation of the line is $y=25$. Setting these equal to each other, we get $(x-11)^2=25$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x-11=\pm 5$, so $x=6$ or $x=16$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points are 6 and 16. The $y$-coordinate of both points is 25. Using the distance formula, we get $d=\sqrt{(16-6)^2+(25-25)^2}=\sqrt{100}=10$.

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear function to model the oil and gas production, where the slope represents the rate of change of the production and the y-intercept represents the initial production in 2000.
  We can find the slope of the linear function by dividing the change in production by the change in time.
  The change in production is 4 - 1.9 = 2.1 million barrels.
  The change in time is 2013 - 2000 = 13 years.
  Therefore, the slope of the linear function is -2.1/13 = -0.1615 (rounded to four decimal places).
  The y-intercept of the linear function is 4 million barrels.
  A: The slope of this function is $\frac{21}{130}$, which is positive, so it does not model a decrease in production. Therefore, it is not a good model.
  B: The slope of this function is $\frac{19}{130}$, which is positive, so it does not model a decrease in production. Therefore, it is not a good model.
  C: The slope of this function is $-\frac{21}{130}$, which is negative, so it models a decrease in production. Therefore, it is a possible model.
  D: The slope of this function is $-\frac{19}{130}$, which is negative, so it models a decrease in production. Therefore, it is a possible model.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear function to model the oil and gas production, where the slope represents the rate of change of the production and the y-intercept represents the initial production in 2000.
  We can find the slope of the linear function by dividing the change in production by the change in time.
  The change in production is 4 - 1.9 = 2.1 million barrels.
  The change in time is 2013 - 2000 = 13 years.
  Therefore, the slope of the linear function is -2.1/13 = -0.1615 (rounded to four decimal places).
  The y-intercept of the linear function is 4 million barrels.
  A: The slope of this function is $\frac{21}{130}$, which is positive, so it does not model a decrease in production. Therefore, it is not a good model.
  B: The slope of this function is $\frac{19}{130}$, which is positive, so it does not model a decrease in production. Therefore, it is not a good model.
  C: The slope of this function is $-\frac{21}{130}$, which is negative, so it models a decrease in production. Therefore, it is a possible model.

  The slope of the line passing through $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $m=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+b$ for some value of $b$.
  We can use the point $(1,5)$ to find $b$: $5=4(1)+b$, so $b=1$.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$.
  Answer: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  A linear function has the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  To find the slope of a linear function, we can use the formula $m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$.
  We can use the given table to find two points on the line and then calculate the slope.

Topic: Math
Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
The table shows that out of the 200 people surveyed, 36 recalled no dreams, leaving 164 who recalled at least 1 dream. Out of these 164 people, 68 belonged to Group Y. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{68}{164}$$

Simplifying this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, we get:

$$\frac{68}{164} = \frac{17}{41}$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\frac{79}{164}$.

Choices:
  A: Mean
  B: Median
  C: Range
  D: Standard deviation
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Mean is the average of a set of numbers.
  Median is the middle value of a set of numbers.
  Range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a set of numbers.
  Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.

If we subtract 10 from the weight of the lightest horse, the range will increase by 10 pounds. The median will not change because it is based on the middle value of the data set, and subtracting 10 from the weight of the lightest horse will not affect the middle value. The standard deviation will change because it is a measure of the amount of variation in the data set, and subtracting 10 from the weight of the lightest horse will decrease the variation. However, the mean will also change because it is affected by every value in the data set, and subtracting 10 from the weight of the lightest horse will decrease the sum of the values and therefore decrease the mean.

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The energy per gram of protein is 4.0 food calories or 16.7 kilojoules.
  The energy per gram of fat is 9.0 food calories or 37.7 kilojoules.
  The energy per gram of carbohydrate is 4.0 food calories or 16.7 kilojoules.
  The granola bar has a total of 180 food calories.
  
Solution:
  Let's assume that the granola bar has $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate.
  The total energy in the granola bar is the sum of the energy from each macronutrient:
  $180 = 4p + 9f + 4c$
  We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$.
  Rearranging the equation, we get:
  $9f = 180 - 4p - 4c$
  $f = \frac{180 - 4p - 4c}{9}$
  $f = \frac{20(9) - 4p - 4c}{9}$
  $f = \frac{20(9) - 4(p+c)}{9}$
  $f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  
Action: Answer("B")

  Let's assume that the granola bar has $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate.
  The total energy in the granola bar is the sum of the energy from each macronutrient:
  $180 = 4p + 9f + 4c$
  We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$.
  Rearranging the equation, we get:
  $9f = 180 - 4p - 4c$
  $f = \frac{180 - 4p - 4c}{9}$
  $f = \frac{20(9) - 4p - 4c}{9}$
  $f = \frac{20(9) - 4(p+c)}{9}$
  $f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The formula for the speed of sound wave in air is given by $a=1,052+1.08 t$, where $a$ is the speed of sound wave in feet per second and $t$ is the air temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
  To find the air temperature at which the speed of sound wave is closest to 1,000 feet per second, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000.
  We can solve for $t$ by rearranging the formula as $t=\frac{a-1,052}{1.08}$.
Action: 
  We need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can do this by finding the value of $t$ that makes $|a-1,000|$ smallest.
  We can calculate $t$ for each choice as follows:
  - For choice A: $t=\frac{1,000-1,052}{1.08} \approx -48.15$
  - For choice B: $t=\frac{1,000-1,052}{1.08} \approx -48.15$
  - For choice C: $t=\frac{1,000-1,052}{1.08} \approx -48.15$
  - For choice D: $t=\frac{1,000-1,052}{1.08} \approx -48.15$
  Since all choices give the same value of $t$, we can select any of them.

  The function $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ can be expanded to $f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 3$.
  The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ is $-\frac{b}{2a}$.
Action: 
  The function $f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 3$ can be rewritten as $f(x) = (x+2)^2 - 1$. 
  Therefore, the vertex of the graph of $f$ is at $(-2,-1)$.
  The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$, which is in the interval $-3<x<1$.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The equation $0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$ represents the situation where Clayton mixes $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution.
  We are given that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution.
  We want to find how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution Clayton must use.
Action: 
  We can start by substituting $y=100$ into the equation $0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$ and solving for $x$:
  $$0.10 x+0.20 (100)=0.18(x+100)$$
  $$0.10 x+20=0.18 x+18$$
  $$0.10 x-0.18 x=18-20$$
  $$-0.08 x=-2$$
  $$x=\frac{-2}{-0.08}=25$$
  Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 25}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline\multicolumn{7}{|c|}{Lengths of Fish (in inches)} \\\hline8 & 9 & 9 & 9 & 10 & 10 & 11 \\\hline11 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 13 & 13 \\\hline13 & 14 & 14 & 15 & 15 & 16 & 24 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above lists the lengths, to the nearest inch, of a random sample of 21 brown bullhead fish. The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error. Of the mean, median, and range of the values listed, which will change the most if the 24 -inch measurement is removed from the data?
Choices:
  A: Mean
  B: Median
  C: Range
  D: They will all change by the same amount.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Mean is the average of a set of numbers.
  Median is the middle value of a set of numbers.
  Range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a set of numbers.
  The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error and should be removed from the data.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  If the 24-inch measurement is removed from the data, the range will decrease by 10 (from 16-6 to 15-5), but the median will remain the same (it is the middle value, and removing the largest value does not change the position of the middle value). However, the mean will be affected by the removal of the outlier. The sum of the remaining 20 measurements is 226, so the mean will be 226/20 = 11.3. If the 24-inch measurement is included, the sum of the 21 measurements is 250, so the mean is 250/21 ≈ 11.9. Therefore, the mean will change the most if the 24-inch measurement is removed from the data.

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In planning maintenance for a city's infrastructure, a civil engineer estimates that, starting from the present, the population of the city will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years. If the present population of the city is 50,000, which of the following expressions represents the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now?
Choices:
  A: $50,000(0.1)^{20 t}$
  B: $50,000(0.1)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
  C: $50,000(0.9)^{20 t}$
  D: $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The population of the city will decrease by 10% every 20 years.
  The present population of the city is 50,000.
  
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for exponential decay, which is given by: 

  $A = A_0 r^{\frac{t}{d}}$

where:
  A is the amount after time t
  A_0 is the initial amount
  r is the growth or decay rate
  d is the time it takes for the amount to grow or decay by a factor of r

In this case, the decay rate is 0.1 (10% decrease), the initial amount is 50,000, and the time it takes for the population to decrease by a factor of 0.1 is 20 years. Therefore, we have:

  $A = 50,000(0.1)^{\frac{t}{20}}$

Question: A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let the original length and width of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$, respectively.
  The original area of the rectangle is $lw$.
  After the alterations, the new length of the rectangle is $1.1l$ and the new width is $(1-\frac{p}{100})w$.
  The new area of the rectangle is $(1-0.12)lw$.
  We want to find the value of $p$.
  
Solution:
  The new area of the rectangle is $(1-0.12)lw = 0.88lw$.
  The new length of the rectangle is $1.1l$ and the new width is $(1-\frac{p}{100})w$.

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ for all values of $x$, and $a+b=8$, what are the two possible values for $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: 3 and 5
  B: 6 and 35
  C: 10 and 21
  D: 31 and 41
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We can expand the left-hand side of the equation to get a quadratic equation in the form of $ax^2+bx+c$.
  We can then compare the coefficients of the quadratic equation to the given quadratic equation to find the value of $c$.
  We can also use the fact that the coefficient of $x$ in the given quadratic equation is equal to $c$ plus the product of the constants in the two linear factors.
  
Solution:
  Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get:
  $$(a x+2)(b x+7)=a b x^{2}+(7 a+2 b) x+14$$
  Comparing the coefficients of the quadratic equation to the given quadratic equation, we get:
  $$ab=15$$
  $$7a+2b= c$$
  We also know that $a+b=8$, so we can solve for $a$ and $b$:
  $$a=8-b$$
  Substituting into the first equation, we get:
  $$(8-b)b=15$$
  $$b^2-8b+15=0$$
  $$(b-3)(b-5)=0$$
  $$b=3 \text{ or } b=5$$
  If $b=3$, then $a=5$, and $c=7a+2b=35$.
  If $b=5$, then $a=3$, and $c=7a+2b=23$.
  Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 23 and 35.

The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  A linear function has the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$.
  The slope represents the rate of change of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable.
  In this case, the dependent variable is the monthly rental price $r$, and the independent variable is the property's purchase price $p$.
  We can use two points from the table to find the slope of the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$.
  
Action: 
  Let's choose two points from the table, for example, $(128,950)$ and $(176,1310)$.
  The slope of the line passing through these two points is $m=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=\frac{360}{48}=7.5$.
  Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is of the form $r(p)=7.5p+b$.
  To find the y-intercept $b$, we can use one of the points, for example, $(128,950)$:
  $950=7.5(128)+b \Rightarrow b=950-7.5(128)=-10$.
  Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is $r(p)=7.5p-10$.

  We can use two points from the table to find the slope of the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$.
  
Action: 
  Let's choose two points from the table, for example, $(128,950)$ and $(176,1310)$.
  The slope of the line passing through these two points is $m=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=\frac{360}{48}=7.5$.
  Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is of the form $r(p)=7.5p+b$.
  To find the y-intercept $b$, we can use one of the points, for example, $(128,950)$:
  $950=7.5(128)+b \Rightarrow b=950-7.5(128)=-10$.
  Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is $r(p)=7.5p-10$.
  Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  A linear function has the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$.
  The slope represents the rate of change of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable.
  In this case, the dependent variable is the monthly rental price $r$, and the independent variable is the property's purchase price $p$.

Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& b=2.35+0.25 x \\& c=1.75+0.40 x\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ represent the price per pound, in dollars, of beef and chicken, respectively, $x$ weeks after July 1 during last summer. What was the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 2.60$
  B: $\$ 2.85$
  C: $\$ 2.95$
  D: $\$ 3.35$
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  To find the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken, we need to set $b=c$ and solve for $x$.
  We can then substitute the value of $x$ into either equation to find the price per pound of beef (or chicken).
Action: 
  Setting $b=c$, we get:
  $$2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$$
  Solving for $x$, we get:
  $$x=12$$
  Substituting $x=12$ into the equation for $b$, we get:
  $$b=2.35+0.25(12)=\boxed{\$ 5.35}$$
  Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(None of the Above)}}$.

Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let's first calculate the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never". This is equal to $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$. 

Now, we need to calculate the probability that a tablet user answered "Always" given that they did not answer "Never". This is equal to the percentage of "Always" answers out of the total percentage of answers that are not "Never". 

The total percentage of answers that are not "Never" is $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$. 

The percentage of "Always" answers out of the total percentage of answers that are not "Never" is $\frac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.4496$. 

Rounding to two decimal places, we get 0.45. 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) 0.45.

The percentage of "Always" answers out of the total percentage of answers that are not "Never" is $\frac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.4496$. 

Rounding to two decimal places, we get 0.45. 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) 0.45.

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$

### Exam: sat-math-100 | Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$The equation above gives the height $h$, in feet, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is thrown straight up with an initial speed of $v$ feet per second from a height of $k$ feet. Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: $v=h+k-16 t$
  B: $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$
  C: $v=\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$
  D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The given equation is a quadratic equation in the form of $h = at^2 + bt + c$, where $a = -16$, $b = v$, and $c = k$.
  We can use the quadratic formula to solve for $v$: $v = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
Action: 
  Solving for $v$ using the quadratic formula, we get:
  $v = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
  $v = \frac{-v \pm \sqrt{v^2 - 4(-16)(k-h)}}{2(-16)}$
  $v = \frac{-v \pm \sqrt{v^2 + 64(4h-4k)}}{-32}$
  $v = \frac{v \mp \sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}}{32}$
  Since the ball is thrown upwards, we know that $v$ is positive. Therefore, we take the positive square root:
  $v = \frac{v + \sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}}{32}$
  $v - \frac{v + \sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}}{32} = 0$
  $v - \frac{v}{32} - \frac{\sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}}{32} = 0$
  $\frac{31v}{32} = \frac{\sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}}{32}$
  $31v = \sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}$
  $961v^2 = v^2 + 256h - 256k$
  $960v^2 = 256h - 256k$
  $v^2 = \frac{64}{15}(h-k)$
  $v = \sqrt{\frac{64}{15}(h-k)}$
  Therefore, the answer is (none of the above).

  We can use the quadratic formula to solve for $v$: $v = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
Action: 
  Solving for $v$ using the quadratic formula, we get:
  $v = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
  $v = \frac{-v \pm \sqrt{v^2 - 4(-16)(k-h)}}{2(-16)}$
  $v = \frac{-v \pm \sqrt{v^2 + 64(4h-4k)}}{-32}$
  $v = \frac{v \mp \sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}}{32}$
  Since the ball is thrown upwards, we know that $v$ is positive. Therefore, we take the positive square root:
  $v = \frac{v + \sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}}{32}$
  $v - \frac{v + \sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}}{32} = 0$
  $v - \frac{v}{32} - \frac{\sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}}{32} = 0$
  $\frac{31v}{32} = \frac{\sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}}{32}$
  $31v = \sqrt{v^2 + 256h - 256k}$
  $961v^2 = v^2 + 256h - 256k$
  $960v^2 = 256h - 256k$
  $v^2 = \frac{64}{15}(h-k)$
  $v = \sqrt{\frac{64}{15}(h-k)}$
  Therefore, the answer is (none of the above).

Question: A 60 years old patient who had myocardial infarction 2 weeks back, the lipid profile is done for a patient and reveals HDL 32 mgldL, LDL 126 mg/dl, TG 276 mgl/dL. Which of the following is preferred for this patient ?
Choices:
  A: Rosuvastatin + Fenofibrate
  B: Fenofibrate alone
  C: Rosuvastatin 10 mg
  D: Atorvastatin 80 mg
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Myocardial infarction is a medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked.
  HDL is the "good" cholesterol, while LDL is the "bad" cholesterol.
  High levels of triglycerides (TG) in the blood can increase the risk of heart disease.
  Statins are a class of drugs that lower cholesterol levels in the blood.
  Fenofibrate is a fibrate drug that lowers triglycerides and raises HDL cholesterol levels.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  The patient has low HDL, high LDL, and high TG levels, which puts them at risk for cardiovascular disease. The preferred treatment for this patient would be a combination of a statin and a fibrate drug. Rosuvastatin and fenofibrate have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with dyslipidemia. Therefore, the best option for this patient would be Rosuvastatin + Fenofibrate (Option A).

  B: Increased blood supply through the wide apex
  C: Increased volume of pulp in primary teeth
  D: Lesser amount of collagen fibres in young
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Pulpectomy is a dental procedure that involves the complete removal of the dental pulp, while pulp capping is a dental procedure that involves the placement of a medicament over an exposed pulp to promote healing and the formation of a dentin bridge.
  Primary teeth are the first set of teeth that erupt in a child's mouth and are eventually replaced by permanent teeth.

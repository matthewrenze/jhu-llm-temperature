Choices:
  A: Rosuvastatin + Fenofibrate
  B: Fenofibrate alone
  C: Rosuvastatin 10 mg
  D: Atorvastatin 80 mg
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  High levels of LDL and triglycerides and low levels of HDL are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
  Statins are the first-line drugs for reducing LDL cholesterol levels.
  Fibrates are used to reduce triglyceride levels and increase HDL levels.
  Combination therapy with statins and fibrates may increase the risk of side effects such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.
Action: Answer("C")  
Based on the patient's lipid profile, the preferred treatment would be a statin to lower LDL cholesterol levels. Rosuvastatin 10 mg is a reasonable starting dose for this patient. Fibrates are not the first-line treatment for this patient, and combination therapy with statins and fibrates is not recommended due to the risk of side effects. Atorvastatin 80 mg is a high dose and may increase the risk of side effects.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  - Myocardial infarction is a medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked.
  - Lipid profile is a blood test that measures the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.
  - HDL is the "good" cholesterol, while LDL is the "bad" cholesterol.
  - High levels of triglycerides in the blood can increase the risk of heart disease.
  - Statins are a class of drugs that lower cholesterol levels in the blood.
  - Fenofibrate is a drug that lowers triglyceride levels in the blood.
  
Analysis:
  - The patient had a myocardial infarction 2 weeks back, which puts him at a high risk of developing further heart problems.
  - The lipid profile reveals high levels of triglycerides and low levels of HDL, which are both risk factors for heart disease.
  - The preferred treatment for this patient would be a combination of a statin and a fibrate, as this would help to lower both cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Myocardial infarction is a condition where there is a blockage in the blood flow to the heart.
  - Lipid profile is a blood test that measures the levels of different types of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.
  - HDL is considered as good cholesterol, while LDL and TG are considered as bad cholesterol.
  - Statins are a class of drugs that are used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood.
  - Fenofibrate is a drug that is used to lower triglyceride levels in the blood.
  
Analysis:
  - The patient had a myocardial infarction 2 weeks back, which puts the patient at a higher risk of developing further cardiovascular events.
  - The lipid profile reveals high levels of TG and low levels of HDL, which are both risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
  - Rosuvastatin and Atorvastatin are both statins that are commonly used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood.
  - Fenofibrate is a drug that is used to lower triglyceride levels in the blood.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
Based on the patient's lipid profile, a combination of Rosuvastatin and Fenofibrate would be preferred for this patient. This is because the patient has high levels of TG, which can be effectively lowered by Fenofibrate, and low levels of HDL, which can be improved by Rosuvastatin.
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Myocardial infarction is a serious medical condition that requires careful management of risk factors, including dyslipidemia.
  HDL is considered the "good" cholesterol, while LDL and TG are considered "bad" cholesterol.
  Statins are the first-line therapy for dyslipidemia, while fibrates are used as an adjunct therapy in patients with high TG levels.
  Combination therapy with statins and fibrates may increase the risk of adverse effects, such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.
  
Analysis:
  The patient has dyslipidemia with high TG levels, which suggests that fibrates may be beneficial.
  However, combination therapy with statins and fibrates is not recommended due to the risk of adverse effects.
  Rosuvastatin or Atorvastatin are both appropriate first-line therapies for dyslipidemia, but the dose of Atorvastatin 80 mg is high and may increase the risk of adverse effects.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
  Rosuvastatin 10 mg is the preferred therapy for this patient, as it is a first-line therapy for dyslipidemia and has a lower risk of adverse effects compared to Atorvastatin 80 mg.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Myocardial infarction is a medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked.
  HDL, LDL, and TG are types of cholesterol.
  High levels of LDL and TG and low levels of HDL are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
  Statins are a class of drugs that lower cholesterol levels.
  Fenofibrate is a fibrate drug that lowers triglyceride levels.
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation: 
  The patient has high levels of TG and low levels of HDL, which are both risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a combination of a statin and a fibrate drug is preferred to manage the lipid profile. Rosuvastatin and fenofibrate have been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with dyslipidemia. Atorvastatin 80 mg is a high dose and may increase the risk of side effects. Rosuvastatin 10 mg alone may not be sufficient to manage the patient's lipid profile. Fenofibrate alone may not be sufficient to manage the patient's LDL levels.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Myocardial infarction is a medical emergency that occurs when blood supply to a part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot. 
  Lipid profile is a blood test that measures the amount of cholesterol and fats called triglycerides in the blood.
  HDL is known as good cholesterol, while LDL is known as bad cholesterol.
  High levels of triglycerides in the blood can increase the risk of heart disease.
  Statins are a class of drugs that lower cholesterol levels in the blood.
  Fenofibrate is a fibrate drug that lowers triglyceride levels in the blood.
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: 
  The patient has low HDL, high LDL, and high triglyceride levels, which puts him at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The preferred treatment for this patient would be a combination of a statin and a fibrate. Rosuvastatin is a statin that can lower LDL levels, while fenofibrate is a fibrate that can lower triglyceride levels and increase HDL levels. Therefore, the preferred option for this patient would be Rosuvastatin + Fenofibrate.
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Myocardial infarction (MI) is a medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle.
  Lipid profile is a blood test that measures the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.
  HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is considered "good" cholesterol because it helps remove LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or "bad" cholesterol from the arteries.
  LDL is considered "bad" cholesterol because it contributes to the formation of plaque in the arteries.
  TG (triglycerides) are a type of fat found in the blood that can contribute to the formation of plaque in the arteries.
  Statins are a class of drugs that lower LDL cholesterol levels.
  Fenofibrate is a drug that lowers TG levels and increases HDL levels.
  
Analysis:
  The patient had a myocardial infarction 2 weeks back, and the lipid profile shows that the patient has low HDL, high LDL, and high TG levels. This indicates that the patient is at risk for cardiovascular disease. The preferred treatment for this patient would be a combination of a statin and fenofibrate to lower LDL and TG levels and increase HDL levels.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Myocardial infarction (MI) is a medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle.
  Lipid profile is a blood test that measures the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.
  HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is known as "good" cholesterol because it helps remove LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or "bad" cholesterol from the bloodstream.
  LDL is known as "bad" cholesterol because it can build up in the walls of arteries and form plaques, which can lead to heart disease.
  TG (triglycerides) are a type of fat found in the blood that can also contribute to the development of heart disease.
  Statins are a class of drugs that lower cholesterol levels in the blood and reduce the risk of heart disease.
  Fenofibrate is a drug that lowers triglyceride levels in the blood.
  
Analysis:
  The patient had a myocardial infarction 2 weeks back, which puts him at a higher risk of developing heart disease. The lipid profile shows that the patient has low HDL, high LDL, and high TG levels, which are all risk factors for heart disease. Therefore, the patient would benefit from a medication that can lower his cholesterol and triglyceride levels. 
  
  A: Rosuvastatin + Fenofibrate - This combination can be effective in lowering both LDL and TG levels, but it is not the preferred option for this patient because it can increase the risk of side effects such as muscle pain and liver damage.
  
  B: Fenofibrate alone - Fenofibrate can lower TG levels, but it is not effective in lowering LDL levels, which are also high in this patient. Therefore, this is not the preferred option for this patient.
  
  C: Rosuvastatin 10 mg - Rosuvastatin is a statin that can effectively lower LDL levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. This is a good option for this patient because he has high LDL levels.
  
  D: Atorvastatin 80 mg - Atorvastatin is a statin that can effectively lower LDL levels, but it is not the preferred option for this patient because it is associated with a higher risk of side effects compared to other statins.

  Pulpectomy is a dental procedure that involves the complete removal of the dental pulp from the root canal, while pulp capping is a dental procedure that involves the placement of a medicament over an exposed pulp to promote healing and the formation of dentin.
  Primary teeth are the first set of teeth that erupt in children and are eventually replaced by permanent teeth.
  A: Odontoblasts are cells that form dentin, which is the hard tissue that makes up the bulk of the tooth. Increased odontoblastic activity in the young may contribute to the success of pulpectomy and pulp capping in primary teeth.
  B: Blood supply is important for the healing process, but it is not a major factor in the success of pulpectomy and pulp capping in primary teeth.
  C: The volume of pulp in primary teeth is smaller than in permanent teeth, which may make the procedure easier to perform, but it is not a major factor in the success of pulpectomy and pulp capping in primary teeth.
  D: Collagen fibers are a major component of the extracellular matrix of the dental pulp, but their amount is not a major factor in the success of pulpectomy and pulp capping in primary teeth.

Topic: Dental
Question: A lateral sliding flap done on a tooth with roots denuded for 6 years will show
Choices:
  A: PDL fibres attached to cementum
  B: PDL fibres attached to dentin
  C: Epithelium adjacent to previously denuded root surface
  D: Co adaptation to the remaining fibres
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  A lateral sliding flap is a surgical procedure used to gain access to the root surface of a tooth.
  PDL (periodontal ligament) fibres attach the tooth to the surrounding bone and cementum.
  Cementum is a layer of hard, mineralized tissue that covers the root surface of a tooth.
  Dentin is a layer of hard, mineralized tissue that makes up the bulk of the tooth structure.
  Epithelium is a layer of cells that covers the outer surface of the body and lines the cavities and passages that communicate with the exterior.
  
Answer: 
  A lateral sliding flap done on a tooth with roots denuded for 6 years will show PDL fibres attached to cementum. Therefore, the best answer is A.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  A lateral sliding flap is a surgical procedure used to access the root surface of a tooth.
  PDL stands for periodontal ligament, which is a group of fibers that attach the tooth to the surrounding bone.
  Cementum is a layer of hard, mineralized tissue that covers the root surface of a tooth.
  Dentin is a hard, mineralized tissue that makes up the bulk of the tooth structure.
  Epithelium is a layer of cells that covers the surface of the body or lines a cavity.
  
Answer: 
  After 6 years of root denudation, the PDL fibers will have been lost from the cementum and dentin. 
  The epithelium will have migrated apically to cover the previously denuded root surface.
  Co-adaptation to the remaining fibers is not a feature of a lateral sliding flap.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is C: Epithelium adjacent to previously denuded root surface. 
  Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  A lateral sliding flap is a surgical technique used in periodontal surgery to gain access to the root surface of a tooth.
  Roots denuded for 6 years means that the root surface has been exposed for 6 years.
  A: The periodontal ligament (PDL) fibres attach the cementum covering the root surface to the alveolar bone. If the root surface has been denuded for 6 years, it is unlikely that PDL fibres will be attached to the cementum.
  B: The PDL fibres attach the cementum covering the root surface to the alveolar bone. If the root surface has been denuded for 6 years, it is unlikely that PDL fibres will be attached to the dentin.
  C: After the root surface has been denuded, the epithelium migrates and attaches to the root surface. If the root surface has been denuded for 6 years, it is likely that the epithelium will be adjacent to the previously denuded root surface.
  D: Co-adaptation refers to the adaptation of the gingival tissue to the tooth surface. It is not related to the PDL fibres or the root surface.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:

  B: PDL fibres are attached to dentin, but if the root surface has been denuded for 6 years, it is unlikely that PDL fibres will be attached to dentin.
  C: Epithelium adjacent to previously denuded root surface is likely to be present because the epithelium migrates to cover the exposed root surface.
  D: Co adaptation to the remaining fibres is a possible outcome of the lateral sliding flap procedure, but it is not related to the presence or absence of PDL fibres or epithelium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  A lateral sliding flap is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the gingiva and then sliding the flap laterally to expose the underlying bone and tooth roots.
  Roots denuded for 6 years means that the roots have been exposed for 6 years.
  A: PDL fibres are periodontal ligament fibers that attach the tooth to the surrounding bone. If the roots have been denuded for 6 years, it is unlikely that PDL fibers will be attached to cementum.
  B: Dentin is the hard, calcified tissue that makes up the bulk of the tooth. If the roots have been denuded for 6 years, it is unlikely that PDL fibers will be attached to dentin.
  C: Epithelium is a layer of cells that covers the surface of the tooth root. If the roots have been denuded for 6 years, it is likely that epithelium will be adjacent to the previously denuded root surface.
  D: Co adaptation to the remaining fibers is a process by which the remaining PDL fibers adapt to the new position of the tooth after a surgical procedure. It is possible that this may occur after a lateral sliding flap procedure.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  A lateral sliding flap is a surgical procedure used to gain access to the root of a tooth.
  Roots that have been denuded for a long time may have lost some of their periodontal ligament (PDL) fibers.
  A: PDL fibers are normally attached to cementum, but if the roots have been denuded for a long time, the PDL fibers may have been lost.
  B: PDL fibers are normally attached to dentin, but if the roots have been denuded for a long time, the PDL fibers may have been lost.

Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 3
  C: 5
  D: 8
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Bishop score is used to assess the readiness of the cervix for induction of labor. 
  The score is based on five components: cervical dilation, cervical effacement, cervical consistency, cervical position, and fetal station.
  The maximum score is 13, and a score of 8 or higher indicates that the cervix is favorable for induction of labor.
  In this case, the cervix is 1 cm dilated, 30% effaced, the vertex is at -1 station, and the cervix is soft and posterior.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The Bishop score is a system used to assess the readiness of the cervix for induction of labor.
  The Bishop score is determined by evaluating the following factors: cervical dilation, cervical effacement, cervical consistency, cervical position, and fetal station.
  The maximum score is 13, and a score of 8 or higher is generally considered favorable for induction of labor.
  A: A Bishop score of 0 indicates an unfavorable cervix.
  B: A Bishop score of 3 indicates an unfavorable cervix.
  C: A Bishop score of 5 indicates a partially favorable cervix.
  D: A Bishop score of 8 or higher indicates a favorable cervix.

### Exam: medmcqa-dev-100 | Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Pediatrics
Question: A neonate presents with jaundice and clay coloured stools. Liver biopsy shows giant cells diagnosis is –
Choices:
  A: Neonatal hepatitis with physiological jaundice
  B: Neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia
  C: Physiological jaundice
  D: Physiological jaundice with extrahepatic biliary atresia
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Jaundice is a common finding in neonates and can be due to many causes.
  2. Clay-colored stools indicate a lack of bile in the stool, which can be due to biliary obstruction.
  3. Giant cells are a characteristic finding in neonatal hepatitis.
  
Analysis:
  The presence of jaundice and clay-colored stools suggests a biliary obstruction. The liver biopsy showing giant cells is a characteristic finding in neonatal hepatitis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Neonatal hepatitis is a liver inflammation that occurs in the first month of life.
  Extrahepatic biliary atresia is a rare disease that affects infants in which the bile ducts inside or outside the liver do not have normal openings, preventing bile from flowing out of the liver.
  Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes caused by bilirubin, a waste material found in the blood.
  Clay-colored stools are pale, white, or grey stools that may be caused by a lack of bile flow.
  Giant cells are cells that have more than one nucleus.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  1. Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood.
  2. Clay-colored stools are pale, white, or light-colored stools that are not normal and may be due to a lack of bile in the stool.
  3. Giant cells are a type of cell that can be seen in liver biopsy in various conditions, including viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and biliary atresia.
  
Analysis:
  The neonate's presentation of jaundice and clay-colored stools suggests a liver or biliary tract problem. The presence of giant cells on liver biopsy further supports a liver disease. Physiological jaundice is a common and benign condition in neonates, but it does not cause clay-colored stools or giant cells on liver biopsy. Extrahepatic biliary atresia is a rare but serious condition that can cause jaundice and clay-colored stools in neonates, and it can be diagnosed by liver biopsy showing giant cells. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  1. Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to an increase in bilirubin levels in the blood.
  2. Clay-colored stools are pale, white, or light-colored stools that may be caused by a lack of bile in the stool.
  3. Giant cells are a type of cell that can be seen in liver biopsy samples and are associated with liver damage.
  
A: Neonatal hepatitis with physiological jaundice is unlikely because the presence of giant cells indicates liver damage, which is not a feature of physiological jaundice.
B: Neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia is a possibility because extrahepatic biliary atresia is a condition that can cause jaundice and clay-colored stools in neonates. The presence of giant cells on liver biopsy is also consistent with liver damage, which can occur in this condition.
C: Physiological jaundice is unlikely because the presence of giant cells indicates liver damage, which is not a feature of physiological jaundice.
D: Physiological jaundice with extrahepatic biliary atresia is unlikely because the presence of giant cells indicates liver damage, which is not a feature of physiological jaundice.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  1. Jaundice is a common finding in neonates and can be due to various causes.
  2. Clay-colored stools are a sign of obstructive jaundice.
  3. Liver biopsy is a diagnostic test that can help in identifying the underlying cause of jaundice.
  4. Giant cells are a characteristic finding in neonatal hepatitis.
  
Analysis:
  The neonate in the question presents with jaundice and clay-colored stools, which are signs of obstructive jaundice. The liver biopsy shows giant cells, which is a characteristic finding in neonatal hepatitis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is neonatal hepatitis. Extrahepatic biliary atresia can also present with similar symptoms, but the liver biopsy findings are different.

Action: Answer("B") - Neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia. (Note: This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is Neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia)
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to an excess of bilirubin in the blood.
  - Clay-colored stools can be a sign of a lack of bile in the stool.
  - Giant cells are a type of cell that can be seen in liver biopsies and can be indicative of viral hepatitis or other liver diseases.
  A: Neonatal hepatitis with physiological jaundice is a possibility, but the presence of clay-colored stools and giant cells on liver biopsy suggest a more serious condition.
  B: Neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia is a possibility, as this condition can cause jaundice and clay-colored stools. The presence of giant cells on liver biopsy supports this diagnosis.
  C: Physiological jaundice is unlikely, as clay-colored stools are not typically seen in this condition.
  D: Physiological jaundice with extrahepatic biliary atresia is not a recognized diagnosis.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood.
  - Clay-colored stools are pale, white, or light-colored stools that are not normal and may be a sign of a liver problem.
  - Giant cells are a type of cell that can be seen in liver biopsy samples and are associated with liver damage.
  - Neonatal hepatitis is a liver inflammation that occurs in the first month of life.
  - Physiological jaundice is a common condition in newborns that occurs due to the breakdown of red blood cells and is usually not harmful.
  - Extrahepatic biliary atresia is a rare condition in which the bile ducts outside the liver are blocked or absent, leading to liver damage.
  
Analysis:
  The neonate is presenting with jaundice and clay-colored stools, which are signs of liver dysfunction. The liver biopsy shows giant cells, which are associated with liver damage. Therefore, we can rule out physiological jaundice as the cause of the symptoms. The presence of giant cells suggests a liver inflammation, which is consistent with neonatal hepatitis. However, the clay-colored stools suggest an obstruction of the bile ducts, which is not a typical finding in neonatal hepatitis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to an excess of bilirubin in the blood.
  - Clay-colored stools are pale, white, or light-colored stools that may be caused by a lack of bile in the stool.
  - Giant cells are cells with multiple nuclei that can be seen in liver biopsy samples.
  - Neonatal hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that occurs in the first month of life.
  - Physiological jaundice is a common condition in newborns that occurs due to the breakdown of red blood cells and the immature liver's inability to process bilirubin efficiently.
  - Extrahepatic biliary atresia is a rare condition in which the bile ducts outside the liver do not develop correctly or are damaged, leading to bile flow problems.

Analysis:
  The neonate is presenting with jaundice and clay-colored stools, which are signs of liver dysfunction. The liver biopsy shows giant cells, which are indicative of liver inflammation. Therefore, physiological jaundice is unlikely, and neonatal hepatitis or extrahepatic biliary atresia are more probable diagnoses. However, since the biopsy shows giant cells, which are not typically seen in extrahepatic biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis is the most likely diagnosis.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  1. Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to bilirubin deposition.
  2. Clay-colored stools are pale or white stools that may be caused by a lack of bile in the stool.
  3. Liver biopsy is a procedure to remove a small piece of liver tissue for examination under a microscope.
  4. Giant cells are large cells with multiple nuclei that are often seen in viral infections and autoimmune diseases.
  
Analysis:
  The neonate has jaundice and clay-colored stools, which suggest a liver problem. The liver biopsy shows giant cells, which suggest a viral infection or autoimmune disease. Option A and C suggest physiological jaundice, which is a normal condition in newborns and does not cause clay-colored stools or giant cells. Option D suggests physiological jaundice with extrahepatic biliary atresia, which is unlikely because extrahepatic biliary atresia usually presents with dark urine and acholic stools, not clay-colored stools. Option B suggests neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia, which is a possible diagnosis because neonatal hepatitis can cause jaundice and clay-colored stools, and extrahepatic biliary atresia can cause giant cells.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  1. Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to an excess of bilirubin in the blood.
  2. Clay-colored stools are pale or white stools that may be caused by a lack of bile in the stool.
  3. Giant cells are a type of cell that can be seen in liver biopsy samples and are associated with liver damage.
  
A: Neonatal hepatitis with physiological jaundice is unlikely because the presence of clay-colored stools suggests an obstruction of the bile ducts.
B: Neonatal hepatitis with extrahepatic biliary atresia is a possibility because it can cause jaundice and clay-colored stools due to the obstruction of the bile ducts. Giant cells can also be seen in liver biopsy samples of patients with biliary atresia.
C: Physiological jaundice is unlikely because the presence of clay-colored stools suggests an obstruction of the bile ducts.
D: Physiological jaundice with extrahepatic biliary atresia is unlikely because physiological jaundice is a normal process that occurs in newborns due to the breakdown of fetal red blood cells.
